              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens and residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Falun Gong is a peaceful meditation practice based on the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance. Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chinese Communist regime since July 1999, causing thousands to lose their lives from illegal detention and systematic torture. Such conduct stands in blatant violation of all international human rights charters that the Chinese government has itself ratified. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia-Pacific; David Kilgour, tens of thousands of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's transplant market and lost their lives ( www.organharvestinvestigation.net ).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">we, the undersigned, believe we represent a widely enough held opinion within the Australian people to warrant a motion of NO CONFIDENCE in the current Prime Minister, The Honourable Tony Abbott, being tabled in Parliament, and being put to a vote in the House of Representatives.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The reason we are petitioning the House is that, so far (as at the 15 August 2014's version of this petition), and despite requests made directly to various Members, both in Government and in Opposition, to table such a motion, there has been abject failure - by any of the many Members who publicly proclaim TO have "No Confidence" in the Prime Minister - to take that first step which is necessary to initiate a remedy via the Reserve Powers of the Governor General; which include being able to dismiss a prime minister.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Examples of reasons for having "NO Confidence" in Prime Minister Abbott are too numerous - and well known to not only Members of the House but also to the public, in Australia and in many places overseas - to mention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to ensure that such a motion be tabled as a matter of urgency, and â if possible under the Rules of the House â to not require a Division, in order that Members may vote freely and completely in accordance with their conscience, instead of so as to abide with party constraints. Thank you.</span>

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the department) refers asylum seekers to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) for security assessment to inform decision-making.

ASIO issues an ASA where it assesses an individual to be directly or indirectly a risk to security within the meaning of section 4 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. Individuals are advised in writing by the department's officers of the outcome of their security assessment. It is the Australian Government's policy to detain asylum seekers who are the subject of ASAs and who have been assessed as being owed protection obligations, pending resolution of their case.</span>

Third country resettlement may be an option for some individuals, particularly when the individual advises the department that they may have family links in a third country. It may also be possible to safely return an individual to their country of origin in some circumstances, particularly if there has been a change in the situation in their home country.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr JENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  In my last statement I spoke about the historical role played by petitions both in Australia and elsewhere. This time I will take a look at the way different parliaments in Australia deal with petitions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know, Madam Speaker, since 2008 the Standing Committee on Petitions has provided a means for any citizen to have a matter placed directly before the House. Anyone can prepare a petition, gather signatures, and have it presented to the House by me in my capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions or by another member. After presentation the Committee refers the terms of the petition to the responsible minister, and a response is expected within 90 days of the presentation. Other parliaments have evolved different methods for dealing with petitions in terms of both how they are presented in the relevant chamber and what happens to them after presentation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Australian Legislative Assembly requires that petitioners must request a member to present a petition on their behalf. Before presenting petitions, members must first forward petitions to the clerks-at-the-table for certification that they meet the standing orders requirements for petitions to the assembly. Once presented, the petition can then be referred by motion to a committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the Western Australian Legislative Council requires that petitioners request a member to table their petition and that these petitions must first be certified by the clerk as meeting requirements After presentation, petitions are referred to the Environment and Public Affairs Committee, which considers and reports on petitions. All petitions considered by that committee are published on the committee's website along with any additional information such as submissions from petitioners, members, and other interested parties as well as responses to the petition from relevant ministers and government departments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the New South Wales Legislative Assembly it is the clerk who announces petitions rather than members. All petitions presented are referred to the responsible minister, who is expected to provide a response to any petition which attracts more than 500 signatures. This response is expected within 35 days of the petition's presentation, and any response received is tabled in the assembly and published in its Hansard. The subject of petitions with more than 10,000 signatures are made an order of the day for discussion in the assembly, and that discussion is required to occur by 4.30pm on the sitting Thursday following the tabling of the petition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland Parliament's standing orders allow for both traditional paper petitions and electronic petitions.  These standing orders require that e-petitions sponsored by members or by the clerk be published on the Queensland Parliament's website for a period between one week and six months. People wishing to sign the petition provide their name, address and email and, once the posted period has elapsed, these names and addresses are printed along with the petition, which is then presented by the clerk on behalf of the member sponsoring the petition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Ministers are expected to provide a response to the clerk within 30 days, and this response is then published on the Queensland Parliament's website. If a minister is unable to provide a response within 30 days, they are required to provide an interim response which includes reasons for the lack of a full response, with a final response to follow within three months.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The petitions received by Australia's various parliaments are a good reflection of the wide range of concerns and issues present in the Australian community. As I have mentioned in previous statements, this committee's role is to facilitate bringing petitions to the attention of the House and the relevant minister and not to advocate on any particular issue. However, to illustrate the range of topics covered, this morning I presented petitions focused on the plight of Christians in Iraq, marine park boundaries and Australia's asylum seeker policy. The responses presented range from local matters relating to roads and mobile phone reception to national matters like family law and the definition of marriage to international concerns about the recent Sri Lankan civil war and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we can see, petitions form an important part of the political landscape right across Australia. The right of citizens to petition their government seeking redress for grievances is an ancient one, and that right still has ongoing relevance in modern Australia. Thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is actually what the document said. It is something that one might look upon with great surprise now, given what has actually happened since the election. As we have seen time and time again with the Abbott government, this promise, like many others made before the 2013 federal election, was not worth the glossy paper it was written on. Despite claiming to be a government that keeps its promises, the government has not only moved the superannuation goalposts but has yet again broken faith with and made it even more difficult for hardworking Australians to retire with dignity and certainty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government's decision to delay lifting the compulsory superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent until at least 2025 means that not only will Australians lose $128 billion from their retirement savings but also these workersâand we are talking about thousands and thousands of workers, who have negotiated a workplace agreement, relying on another one of this government's promisesâhave been deceived. On 2 September, when Tony Abbott ripped this money from people's retirement savings, he claimed that workers would now see more in their take-home payâa disingenuous argument. No-one is buying the Prime Minister's claim that this superannuation freeze is good for workers. There is no guarantee, let alone evidence, to suggest that workers will now see a subsequent increase in their wages. There is no evidence that employers are moving to renegotiate with those employees to ensure that they put the money that will not be going into superannuation back into the pockets of those working people. In fact, business has been quite clear that people will not see a proportionate increase in their pay.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chief Executive Kate Carnell said that the reduction in future costs was fantastic for business, and she said that although employers had capacity to pay higher wages the correlation would obviously not be linear. If this super freeze is fantastic for anyone, it is certainly not fantastic for the working Australians who will see their retirement income take a hit. And it is not fantastic for those people in the small businesses of Australia who rely on wage earners to be customers, who rely on wage earners to be the people who buy their products and services, because there will not be situation where this money is going into the pockets of working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ai Group Chief Executive Innes Willox does not expect wages to increase to offset the postponement of the superannuation guarantee, and former Reserve Bank Governor Bernie Fraser said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Employers are not going to say, 'well look, we don't have to make this mandatory improvement in super contributions so therefore we are going to give the equivalent amount to workers' - that's not going to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is the truth of it: that is not going to happen. These comments contradict the Prime Minister's argument that workers will not go backwards as a consequence of this superannuation freeze.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Those employees who have negotiated agreements since September of last year have already gone backwards. Because of this superannuation freeze an employee aged 25 will be $9,000 worse off by 2025 and $100,000 worse off by the time they retire. This Prime Minister cannot claim to be a friend of the workers, and he cannot claim to be a friend of those who believe in the right to a dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work. But this motion that I am moving today gives the Prime Minister, the Liberal government and all of those opposite an opportunity to honour, in actions, their words. I call on the government to enable those workers who have made workplace agreements, relying on the pre-election promises that the Prime Minister made, to renegotiate their wages so that they have at least a chance to get into their pockets the money that now will not be going into their superannuation. The government should allow people who made those agreements between 7 September 2013 and 2 September this year to renegotiate the pay they will receive under those agreements, because this government claims that those workers will be getting the money in their pockets. Well, government, Mr Abbott, isâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  The member for Griffith is right: before the last election the coalition did commit that we would not make any unexpected detrimental changes to superannuation, and that commitment was so important, because the context was that the Labor Party had so significantly eroded confidence in our national superannuation system that Australians were crying out for some form of positive statement from the Liberal Party to ensure that we would protect their future savings. Labor for those six years basically treated the superannuation savings of Australians as a piggy bank to just be raided any time there was a hole in the budget that required filling. And don't we know that there were lots of holes in the Labor Party budgets of those six years of government that did need fillingâand invariably they always went to superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During Labor's time in office, Labor announced increased taxes on superannuation of almost $9 billion, including cutting super benefits for low-income earners by more than $3.3 billion. So, it is extraordinarily important to place into context how important and how welcome the coalition's commitment of not making any unexpected detrimental changes to superannuation was. I can assure you that the members of my electorate in Deakin were extraordinarily in favour of that commitment. And we are keeping our commitment to not make any unexpected detrimental changes. We said that we would increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, and we are doing that. But in recognition of the difficult fiscal environment the government is faced withâno thanks to Laborâwe have decided to cushion the budget from the full impact of the increases and boost the superannuation guarantee in a more gradual way. So, instead of increasing from nine to 12 per cent in seven years, from 2013-14 to 2019-20, the guarantee rate will increase from nine to 12 per cent in 13 years, all the way to 2025-26.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And let us be frank: this is not our preferred option, but it is the only option that is on the table. And if people have any concerns, then they should blame Labor, because if Labor had not continued to frustrate our clear mandate on repealing the mining tax then the changes the government has made in respect of the more gradual ramping up of superannuation may not have been necessary. So, I am not sure how anyone in the opposition and in particular the member for Griffith could credibly claim that we are making unexpected detrimental changes to superannuation. We are simply increasing it at a more gradual rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Griffith derides our comments on this side of the House that delaying the increases in superannuation will result in more money being in workers' pockets. Well, every time she derides that statement she also derides the Leader of the Opposition. I would remind her of the Leader of the Oppositions' statement when he was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation in government. He said: 'Increases in compulsory super come out of people's wages.' So I would say to the member for Griffith, if you don't believe us, look at the words of your own leader: 'Increases in superannuation invariably come out of the pockets of workers.' Does that mean we should not aspire to increase superannuation? Of course not. But there is a time and a prudent way in which to do it and, frankly, the Labor Party has no credibility on the issue of superannuation. Having hit superannuation accounts with $9 billion of additional taxes over six years they should, in my view, sheepishly avoid this topic because they have absolutely no credibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to say in respect of this motion that the best thing we can do for people's retirement savings is ensure they have a job. Without a job you are not making contributions to your superannuation account. Without a job you cannot make voluntary contributions to your superannuation account, which all employees can do. That is why we are so focused on building a stronger economy with greater jobs, higher wages and, ultimately, greater superannuation.</span>

                  <a href="BU8" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  There are some issues in politics on which parties' legacies can tell you a lot about what they intend to do. On the issue of Medicare it was Labor who fought to introduce Medicare, it was Labor who reintroduced it after the coalition had scrapped it and it was Labor who fought elections from 1969 through to 1993 against a coalition that wanted to bring down Medicare. And so too with superannuation. Universal superannuation was a Labor achievement brought in despite the opposition of coalition members. When the Hawke government took office in 1983 only 40 per cent of Australian workers had any form of superannuation. After the 1991 reforms that was up to 72 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But universal superannuation was not universally popular. Then Senator Bronwyn Bishop said in the other place:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I heard Senator McMullan said the difference between our systems on superannuation is that ours is compulsory and theirs is voluntary. That is very true. That is an essential difference. Our policy is designed to make it attractive for people to provide for themselves in later life whereas this government's policy is designed to penalise business, to regulate it out of existence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That quote is now 22 years old. The minister at the table is describing it as a silly statement, but it was a clear statement by the then Senator Bishop. My predecessor as the member for Fraser, Senator McMullan, took an opposite view. He took the view that universal superannuation was not a penalty on business; it was an opportunity for workers to be able to retire with dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Griffith, in bringing forward this vital motion, has pointed out that the government's claim that if you do not get it in superannuation contributions you will receive it in wages is false. It is a false claim because of the way in which enterprise agreements are enacted. Enterprise agreements for which applications for approval were made between 7 September 2013 and 2 September 2014 were made on the basis that the superannuation guarantee rate would increase during the life of the agreement. And yet the government's broken promiseâone of manyâsees workers being made worse off as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Hawke government that brought in universal superannuation and envisaged it rising from its initial level of three per cent up to 15 per cent. The Howard government froze it at nine per cent for the best part of a decade, during the noughties. It was the Rudd and Gillard governments that ensured that superannuation would again rise from nine to 12 per cent, and it is not surprising to anyone who knows a modicum of political history that it is the Abbott government that is now freezing it at 9Â½ per cent, a level that is inadequate for Australians' retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that concerns many of my constituents. In a post-budget survey more than 4,000 responded to tell me what they thought about the budget, and they said they did not back the unfair budget. Ninety per cent of participants in a survey in the Fraser electorate told me that they believed the budget broke promises. When I broke that headline figure down by voting preference, even 53 per cent of self-professed Liberal Party voters told me the budget broke promises. Even your supporters on your side of the House are claiming that this budget breaks promises. Eighty-one per cent of respondents said they believed they will be personally worse off or much worse off as a result of decisions in this budget, with women being more concerned than men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I asked Canberrans to nominate which of the government's unfair cuts really worried them, the response was equally strong. More than 88 per cent were concerned about the Abbott government's $80 billion cuts to health and education Not far behind was the deregulation of universities and the changes to HECS, with 82 per cent of Canberrans opposing it. A majority of Canberrans rejected the GP co-payment and changes to Newstart. The survey unequivocally shows Canberrans believe the Abbott government has got it wrong in handing down an unfair budget and that no government should intentionally take the most from those who have the least.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this government does not need another survey of 4,000 Canberrans to tell it how unpopular the budget is. Australians are clamouring about that from the sidelines. Whether they are conservative premiers or backbenchers backgrounding their local newspapers, they know this budget is unfair and breaks promises. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230531" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  It is always a great pleasure to follow my good friend and colleague. We have spent time together. He took us to a part of the debate that elaborated on the traditional parts of Labor's heritage. They want to claim that they own the superannuation space. They want to claim the area around Medicare. Those claims aside, I say that, as a coalition government, we unequivocally own the space of sound economic management. Labor comes nowhere near the coalition's record on running tighter budgets. Labor comes nowhere near on providing the fiscal certainty that this nation needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also spoke about comments that were made 22 years ago about superannuation. I can go a couple years more. Twenty-five years should be a significant number for this parliament. Every time someone walks into this chamber we should be reminding Australians that it has been 25 years since Labor has delivered this country a surplus. They will blame all types of measures for why they have not been able to achieve it, but the underlying fact when it comes to fiscal and economic management, whether it be around superannuation or Medicare, is that they cannot manage a budget. We do it and do it exceptionally well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In bringing the budget back to order, tough decisions need to be made. We should always take the opportunity, when around superannuation, to remind Australians that the decisions that we are making are nothing other than a by-product of Labor's failed fiscal and economic management. We now have to clean up the mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They spoke about promises in earlier speechesâpromises that were broken. I draw you to the promise that was made by the Australian Labor Party when they claimed that they had delivered a surplus to this nationâclaimed openly, broadcasting it through advertising campaigns. Whether or not there was malice or just pure, unadulterated incompetence, I struggle to understand the difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the comments earlier on was a poignant one, where the speaker spoke of those receiving superannuation only doing so because they have a job by the good grace of God. Our position in growing the economy is making sure that small business and the business sector have a strong enough bottom line that they can continue to employ people. For the electorate of the mover of this motion herself: it is a beautiful electorate, busy with small- and medium-sized businesses, predominantly around the food sectorâit is a very picturesque part of Brisbane. As I travel through that electorate regularly I often see more and more businesses closing on weekends because they cannot afford the exorbitant penalty rates put in place by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I sit and wonder: we talk about superannuationâif you do not have a job because your business is not open, how much super are you earning if you are sitting and home unemployed? The answer is 'nothing'. So we have made the decision to freeze the fee-for-superannuation rates from 9Â½ per cent through to 12 and we will not kick them off until 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's leader, when he was the financial services and superannuation minister in government said that increases in compulsory super come out of people's wages. That was his quote. The reality is that it comes out of small business wagesâit is an extra expense on them. I make the point, as does the government, that it is far more prudent for an employee to have a position where they are receiving some form of superannuation, rather than being in the circumstance were growing costs are affecting business and of course they are then not able to have a job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I also rise to support the motion moved by the member for Griffith. It is an important motion because it actually goes to the core of this government and their agenda. It highlights not only the broken promises of this government but also their twisted priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is quite happy to freeze the slow increase in compulsory super contributions for the majority of Australian workers while at the same time repealing legislation which would have seen a fairer superannuation pay for those at the highest end of the super industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A result of this government's legislation to freeze the increase of the compulsory super contribution is that it directly attacks 8.4 million Australian workers. It also highlights how this government fails to really understand the whole concept of super. Super is a generational change. It ensures that when people who started work just after the legislation came in in 1992âpeople of my generationâthat we have a lifetime of super to retire on. So for anybody who is an ordinary worker on a modest income and who is older than someone in their 30s, it needs to be expectedâbecause they do not have that lifetime of superâthat the government may have to partner with them in their retirement income. That could be part of their super and part pension. It is something that this government really fails to understandâthe whole policy area of retirement and retirement income. Maybe the government misunderstand, or maybe there are just a few blatant lies that this government has said. Let's just remind people of what the Prime Minister said prior to the election and what he has said since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He actually came out and said that there would be no changes to superannuationâno changesâthat workers did not have to worry. Regardless of who would be in government there would be no changes with super. Well, that is a lie. We have had people stand up and say that it is because of the budget deficit. Okay, again, another lie. If it were because there is a budget deficit then why did the government repeal the changes that would have seen those who spend over $100,000 a year in their super contributions pay a small amount of tax? Again, it is those twisted priorities by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After changing the super contribution, the Prime Minister has been out there saying that no workers will be worse off. Does the Prime Minister not understand how super works? Super is income. It is workers' income delayed until they retire. So if you freeze that compulsory super contribution, you are in fact cutting the wages of workers. You are cutting what is their deferred income for when they retire. To go on TV and say that this is a good deal for workers demonstrates how the Prime Minister does not understand how superannuation worksâunless, of course, the Prime Minister is about to bring a bill before the House to guarantee that the change in superannuation will be introduced into wages. I am yet to hear an employer say: 'Great news. Because I do not have to increase your super, I am going to increase your wages.' I have not seen that outcome yet in bargaining that is going on right now in Australia. If the Prime Minister wants to be true to his word then he needs to bring forward legislation that would see a guarantee in the increase in workers' wages. I am talking about those on the smallest incomes. I am talking about the 8.4 million ordinary workers in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is not the only one who said that workers would not be worse off. We also have, of course, education minister Christopher Pyne claiming that this would mean that superannuation contributions would stay at 9.5 per cent for the foreseeable future and will go up to 12 per cent, and that the extra that would have gone up to 12 per cent would stay in the pay packets every week. Again, does the education minister not understand how bargaining works? I am yet to see an agreement that actually talks about the fact that this increase in super will now go into increased wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who are we are talking about when it comes to this super reform? Who will benefit the most? It will be women. Women on low incomesâwomen working in child care, hairdressing and hospitality. Labor's reforms would have seen an increase of $5 billion in super savings; super that would have helped those on the lowest incomes have security when they retire. I support the motion before the House. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="LKU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  You would think from this motion and from listening to those opposite that Labor is the best friend of superannuation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Far from being the best friend of superannuation, Labor has wreaked havoc on our superannuation system from the moment of its inception until today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side have a very short memory. During Labor's time in office, Labor actually announced increased taxes on superannuation of almost, not $1 billion, not $2 billion, not $3 billionâno!â$9 billion, including cutting superannuation benefits for lower-income earners by more than $3.3 billion. Moreover, Labor, far from making it easy for people to make voluntary contributions to their superannuation and far from making it easier for people to be able to provide for themselves in their retirement, made it more difficult. It made it more difficult by lowering the thresholds before which people would then be penalised for making additional contributions into their own superannuationâinto their own retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been entirely consistent on superannuation. We said before the election what we were going to do and we are sticking to that promise. We said we would increase the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, and we are doing that. But in recognition of the very difficult fiscal environment that we found ourselves in as a result of Labor's recklessness with our budget and their continued recklessness in borrowing here and thereâparticularly from superannuants, with those $9 billion of taxes I just spoke aboutâthe budget is in desperate need of repair and we need to make sure that we increase the guarantee in a more gradual way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, instead of increasing from nine per cent to 12 per cent in seven yearsâthat is, from 2013-14 to 2019-20âthe superannuation guarantee rate will increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent in 13 years, from 2013-14 to 2025-26. We are keeping our commitment and we are honouring our obligations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor, of course, do not acknowledge their role in the superannuation fiasco that they created. Labor have had about as many different positions as perhaps there are in the Kama Sutra. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition had quite a few flexible positions. I point out that he does sometimes get hit by the honesty stick and he sometimes does say what is truly in his heart. He pointed out on superannuation, when he was Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation in government, that 'increases in compulsory superannuation come out of people's wages.' That is Bill Shorten's quote; these are not my wordsâalthough I do agree with themâthese are the words of Leader of the Opposition. Despite what those opposite have said, it does directly impact workers' wages to increase the superannuation guarantee. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite can be cavalier about the impact that this may have on individuals, their families and their retirement savings. We, on this side of the House, are not so cavalier. We believe it is important for people to save and be self-reliant and we will support them in that endeavour to do just that. That is why we have always made it easier for people to make voluntary contributions to their superannuation. We have always made it more tax effective for them to do so, to provide them with the right incentives to put money aside. It is clear that that has been having a significant impact, which is no thanks to Labor but thanks to the previous coalition government and thanks to the previous economic management of the previous coalition government. We take up that same mantle here in this parliament, in this government, and we will continue our commitment to superannuation for the welfare of all Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion is obviously about suicide, and some of the statistics that have been circulated are very concerning. Suicide is a leading cause of death in Australia for men under the age 44 and women under the age of 34. ABS data shows that in 2009 more people died from suicide deaths than road deaths. How tragic is that? Approximately, one million die by suicide each year worldwide. In Australia, more than one in every 10,000 people take their own lives each year. These are the cold hard facts of suicide. Sadly, in my own electorate of La Trobe we are not immune from these tragedies, like all parts of Australia. As a former police officer at Knox criminal investigations branch and Boronia criminal investigations branch, each week our office would attend at least one suspicious death which was a result of suicide. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot recall how many suicide notes I have read, as that is the key to finding out some sort of reason when you undertake an investigation. When you speak to family and relatives the reason never makes sense. I do have a message for people out there. Quite often you will find in suicide notes that they believe the taking of their life would in some way release a burden from others. It does not do that at all. It just causes enormous stress and grief for family members and friends who have to live with this for so many years. I have had several conversations with Minister Dutton and organisations such as headspace in efforts to address some of these concerns. Headspace is a national youth mental health foundation. They help young people who are going through tough times. A headspace facility, and I am so pleased to say this, will be located at Fountain Gate shopping centre in Narre Warren, and I am working very hard to get a headspace unit facility in the Belgrave health hub. I will make this a major priority for the people of the Dandenong Ranges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before concluding, I would like to congratulate the member for Holt, because I know he has been a true supporter and has been out there on the front line trying to prevent youth suicide in Latrobeâwe have had awful situations in Latrobe. I congratulate him for what he has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, through the government's hot spots program, we organised to put up safety barriers along the train lines where some of these youth tragedies have occurred. Sadly, way too many have occurred. The government's hot spots program is an excellent example of practical measures to reduce suicide hot spots, through the implementation of capital works. I congratulate the principal of Kambrya College in Berwick, Mr Michael Muscat, who campaigned tirelessly for these protective barriers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another great government initiative is the Living Is For Everyone, LIFE, program. It is an evidence based strategic policy framework for suicide prevention in Australia. The reasons people take their own lives are so complex. The balance between risk factors and protective factors seems to be an indicator of the likelihood of someone taking their own life, the experts say. People who take their own lives usually have many risk factors and few protective factors. But this does not explain everything about suicide. Many people with multiple risk factors do not attempt to take their life, and some who do take their lives have few risk factors. The reasons people take their lives are complex; however, we do know that a significant risk factor can be depression and anxiety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, when I speak to young people at schools I always tell them that when they have messages on Facebookâbecause cyberbullying is very prevalent nowâthat a friend does not abuse them and degrade them and bring them down. I always say that rather than looking at that message or conversation every day, just delete it and block that person, because they are not your friend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many organisations here and around the world that try to prevent people from taking their own lives. Beyond Blue is an organisation set up by the previous Victorian premier, Jeff Kennett, in October 2002, and it is doing a fantastic job. In my last conversation with Jeff he was talking about the 'axis of evil'. What comes first is the drugs, or the alcohol, or the depression or the anxiety. The Beyond Blue mission is to focus depression away from a mental health service issue towards one that is understood, acknowledged and addressed by the wider community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians have some experience with anxiety, depression or related conditions, whether they have experienced it themselves or had a family member, friend or work colleague go through it. Beyond Blue's work is aimed at achieving an Australian community that understand depression and anxiety, empowering all Australians at any stage of their life to seek help. This seems to be the key. We all need to get people who suffer with depression and anxiety to seek help. You see, depression and anxiety are treatable. But to have it treated you and the people around you need to recognise troublesome depression and anxiety when it presents itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a problem with mental illness, and thinks like depression, there was a stigma attached, especially in the past. Can I say that these days are very much the old days, and people respect you if you inform your work colleagues and others, and obviously friends and family, that you do have depression and anxiety, because they can help you along your journey to recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are lucky that organisations like Beyond Blue are educating the community about the seriousness of this disease. There are many other fine organisations doing great work in this area: Lifeline, the Black Dog Institute, SANE Australia and headspace are just some of the organisations where people can seek help. That brings me again to my point that the Dandenong Ranges desperately needs a headspace unit, and that would be my priority. As I said before, you and the people around you need to identify the problem. A very good start is your local GP; they can understand and help you get the care and treatment that you need. I would imagine that community awareness is causing more and more people to seek help, and that is obviously a great thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another aspect of suicide that causes unbearable grief is for the people who are left behind when someone takes their own life: mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends and, for young people, their school colleagues. Again, I have been there and spoken to the relatives and friends afterwards. You are not doing anyone any favours; in actual fact you are causing huge grief. So, seek help and seek support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the recent tragedy of Robin Williams taking his lifeâsuch a talented man, such a funny man and so successful. People who did not know Robin Williams grieved openly: why did he do it? How could he do it? And there are so many examples of high-profile people here and overseas who have taken their lives. So here in Canberra, in the big place, we need to understand the significance of suicide for our country. Indeed, we are not immune. People in this place have been touched by suicide, so what can we do as members of parliament?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, providing funding for mental health initiatives is greatly important. Providing capital works funding through things like hotspot programs to help minimise self-harm. But as politicians we need to do more. We need to talk about mental health in our electorates. We need to recognise when someone has a problem in our community and ask them to get help, and to seek help for them. Again, I congratulate the member for Goldstein, Andrew Robb, for what he has done to promote mental health in this placeâcoming out as he did so publicly and declaring he had a problem with depression and then setting about fixing it is so commendable. He is an inspiration for all of us. And now he is a minister doing amazing work with free trade agreements and in investments for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, as a police officer I attended so many suicides, and I must say that all those involved in emergency services also live with this in some ways for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, we should recognise the impacts that depression, anxiety and suicide have on our community. We should all promote the need for people to seek help when there are signs of problems, and we should try to minimise the social stigma is on mental health whenever they occur.</span>

It is a motion that is important not only in his electorate but in each and every electorate in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each and every member of this House would have spoken to the families of somebody whose young son or daughter has taken their lives, or spoken to friends of people who have lost somebody through suicide. I do not think it is recognised how widely suicide impacts on our community, nor the various causes of suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very interesting when you look at some of the statistics associated with suicide. In 2012 there was an average of 6.9 deaths by suicide each and every day. That is incredible! In 2012, 1,901 males and 434 females died through suicide. Suicide is the leading cause of death of men under 44 and of women under 34.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have an epidemic that is attacking young people in our society. If it were another disease we would be lobbied each and every day to invest more money, more resources and more research into the cause of suicide and demanding that governments address this important issue. But instead of that, it is swept under the carpet; it is something that people do not like to talk about. By bringing this motion to the House the member for La Trobe has said that it is not good enough, that we need to talk about this issue, that we need to be very aware of the fact that suicide is attacking the most vital resource of this country: our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate there have been many occasions when young people have taken their lives. There was a young man who attended one of the high schools. He was an outstanding scholar, an outstanding athlete and the most popular person in his year, and he took his own life. The school community was devastated. His parents' lives will never be the same. This happened quite a few years ago nowâabout five years ago. It is in one instant that a person makes that decision to take their lifeâthey feel overwhelmed, they feel hopeless, they feel as though they are in a situation that they cannot plough their way out ofâand they make that decision, particularly young people, without understanding that that decision is irreversible: once you take your life it is gone, and the impact of that decision goes on for years and years and years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ABS stats from 2009 show that there are more deaths from suicide than deaths on the road. Each and every day we are confronted with campaigns to address road deaths. There are campaigns to reduce speeding. There are campaigns designed around not drinking and driving, not taking drugs and driving and not engaging in behaviours that are going to lead to road accidents. Occasionally there is a campaign directed towards addressing the issue of suicide. It was highlighted during Mental Health Weekâand, once again, I congratulate the member for La Trobe for putting this motion before the House at a time following on from Mental Health Weekâthat one of the most prominent mental health issues is depression, and depression leads to suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During Mental Health Week one of the programs that was highlighted was MATES in Construction. I think that is a fantastic program, one that really deserves a mention. Construction workers are more than twice as likely to suicide than other people in Australia. Construction workers are six times as likely to die by suicide than through a workplace accident. And when I say that, construction work is the most unsafe occupation in this country. So, the area that has the most occupational deaths through workplace accidents has a higher rate of suicide than of workplace accidents. That is phenomenal. That is unacceptable. Apprentices in construction are 2Â½ times as likely to suicide as other young men their age. Mental illness on construction sites is now accepted as an industrial safety concern. There are nearly 1,930,000 construction workers in Australia. For workers in the construction industry, suicide seems to be a part of the reality of working in that industry. And it is a highly transient industry. It is an industry in which the workers tend to have a lower level of education and a higher level of literacy problems and probably a higher level of employees undertaking risky behavioursâalcohol, drugs and a higher level of activities that can lead to suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The highly transient nature of the job means that people do not form the bonds and the support you get within a workplace and employmentâworking on a project-by-project basis for weeks and years, constantly moving from one job to another. According to the building employee's redundancy fund, redundancy payouts for the workers in the industry are less than one year's contribution. There were 399 death payments made between 1999 and 2007. In Queensland, particularly in the commercial construction industry, suicide is prominent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program is particularly important because it talks about raising awareness, building capacity, engaging the industry in sustainable programs such as Life Skills Toolbox, which is really good, the MATES in Construction program, Safe TALK, ASIST and Connectors, aimed at building self-reliance, providing help with case management and connecting workers using existing services. It undertakes research, gathers data and partners with research institutions. The MATES in Construction organisation is proactive and responsive, supportive, nonjudgmental, committed and dependable, honest and respectful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry has the highest rate of suicide and this organisation has decided to get in there to address the issue. This needs to happen not only in the construction industry but across the board in Australia. We need to recognise just how predominant suicide is in our community, what a loss it is to our society, how each and every day we are losing young lives and not-so-young lives because suicide is also prominent in older age groups where people feel hopeless and helpless and they do not know how to change their situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by paying tribute to all those organisations which get in there and work with peopleâbeyondblue, the Black Dog Institute and particularly headspace. Like the member for La Trobe, I would love to see a headspace in Lake Macquarie.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McNAMARA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  It is with great sadness that I speak to this motion acknowledging that over the past five years the average number of suicide deaths per year in Australia is 2,415. It is astonishing that in a prosperous country such as Australia suicide is the leading cause of death for men under 44 and for women under 34. Almost twice as many people die from suicide in Australia than from road-related transport accidents. Alarmingly, two in three Australian's know of someone who has died through suicide. Sadly we are losing too many young people to suicide and too many lives are tragically cut short in their prime. Unfortunately, on the Central Coast, we have experienced one of the highest rates of youth suicide in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, there are seven deaths a day by suicide. For every suicide, it is estimated that as many as 30 people attempt to take their own life. This is around 200 attempts per day, more than one every 10 minutes. The sad reality of suicide is that there are people in our community feeling so desperate and alone and, without knowing where to turn for help, the only solution is to take their own life. Not only are bright lights extinguished before their time but families are left broken and communities are left trying to comprehend not only why this occurs but why it occurs so often.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion calls for the government and community to do everything they can to prevent death by suicide. We live in a world which expects so much and where the struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance is increasingly difficult. It is more important than ever that we reach out and support those battling depression and other serious mental health conditions, to tell them that we do care and support them, and to tell them that there is help available and a brighter future ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my role as a federal member of parliament I have been shocked by the prevalence of mental health issues among our youth. As a parent, the thought of mental illness crippling a child is devastating. Our school yards should be filled with hope and optimism, cheerful laughter and potential for life. Sadly, this is not always the case, with an increasing number of students being haunted by the dark clouds of depression and anxiety. As adults, as policy makers and as leaders in our community we must be conscious of the demands and pressures placed upon young Australians Â Â Â and ensure that we are there to lend a helping hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> While the shock of the degree and depth of mental illness in our community is hard to reconcile, I am also enlightened by the many people and organisations dedicated to helping in this field. As the member for Dobell,  I have been privileged to work with many valuable local organisations that help those in need. I have previously shared with the House the opportunities I have been afforded to spend time with organisations, to  promote their efforts in the fight against mental illnessâorganisations such as the Central Coast Suicide Safety Network, the Iris Foundation and the Health and Wellness Centre are constantly working for the Central Coast community. Together they are focused on providing a coordinated response to assessing,  responding and referring people at risk of suiciding to the appropriate level of care. The success of these organisations is owed to the experienced mental health workers, volunteers and community leaders who are dedicated to helping others in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> I was honoured earlier this year to attend the opening of the Iris Foundation's Early Intervention Centre for Suicide Prevention at Wyong Neighbourhood Centre. This was a particularly significant occasion as this new centre is the first of its kind in New South Wales. This centre assists people to obtain the support they require and provides integration into other mental health support services.  I acknowledge the hard work, commitment and dedication of two outstanding womenâDawn Hooper and Bev Baldwin. Without their work, this centre would not be a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> Fortunately  the stigma surrounding mental health is fading. National initiatives including suicide awareness day and R U OK? Day are succeeding in raising awareness and encourage showing interest in the health and wellbeing of our friends, colleagues and family members. There is a broader range of resources available for the families of those affected  by mental illness. Technology now means that help  is available in our homes and workplaces. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another launch I recently had the good fortune to attend was the SANE online forum, a new peer-to-peer support service and partnership with mental health organisations around Australia, providing support for people living with mental illness, their families and carers. I commend the work of everyone involved in raising awareness and offering support to those with mental health issues. I look forward to working with them to enable those affected  a brighter future, free from struggles.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak to and commend the member for La Trobe's private member's motion that deals with our joint concern about the average number of suicide deaths per year in Australia. We have heard the figure of 2,415.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an incredibly disturbing figure. We know that medical experts agree that each of those 2,415 deaths is avoidable and that suicide is the leading cause of deaths in Australia for men under 44 and women under 34. It is imperative that all levels of government, whether local, state, territory or federal, do more to properly support and fund mental health into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for La Trobe knows, we have been hit particularly hard by the devastating impacts of suicide in our area. Our community has dealt with this devastation with courage, resolve and determination; and through wonderful initiatives like the Coming Together to Prevent Youth Suicide Facebook page started by students affected by suicide and their loss to participation in a groundbreaking forum that I hosted with Pat McGorry in 2012 that was covered by <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> called <span style="font-style:italic;">There is No 3G in Heaven</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that suicide is an important subject but here are some other facts. We know that after the game-changing Burdekin report in 1993 that mental health treatment devolved from being solely treated at an institution to being treated in the community; but we also know that mental health service providers have never been appropriately funded by any government to provide that service to the community. As a consequence, some of our best and brightest mental health service providers leave the public system and access to treatment becomes much harder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in Australia governments collectively spend approximately seven per cent of their health budget on mental health and that other comparable First World countries spend up to 14 per cent. In essence, we are spending something like a Third World country on mental health services for our people in this country, and that is completely disgraceful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that only one in five people suffering from a mental illness seeks treatment. We know that we continue to underfund mental health research in this country even though we have some of the best mental health researchers in the world. We know that the stigma around mental health illness continues. Has it abated in the 20 years since Burdekin produced this groundbreaking report? Yes, it has. Is there more to be done to ameliorate the stigma? Of course there is. Are people still dying, because of the stigma associated with mental illness? Yes, they are. Should we accept that? No, we should not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I am a strong supporter of Patrick McGorry's new Australians for Mental Health campaign. In fact I had the honour of launching this campaign along with Professor McGorry on 23 August 2014 at Village Cinemas at Westfield Fountain Gate. This event was attended by nearly 200 people, some of whom had been personally affected by the loss of a loved one due to suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians for Mental Health aims to reduce the stigma and calls for an increase in mental health funding. It calls for improved access to mental health care and for a reduction in the suicide toll by 25 per cent of its current rateâwhich is 2,361 deaths per annum by 2016âand by 50 per cent of its current rate by 2020.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The millions of dollars spent on new road safety programs like wearing seat belts that were introduced in 1973 have reduced the national road toll, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, from 3,798 deaths in 1970 to 1,193 deaths in 2013. If a similar national campaign was embarked upon by governments, federal, state and local, we could reduce the national suicide rate in the coming years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a local level, the City of Casey has made some important progress in reducing the stigma associated with mental illness and suicide, particularly youth suicide, and by providing new mental health services. The member for La Trobe mentioned the headspace at Dandenong and the new headspace at Fountain Gate, which is in the member for La Trobe's electorate but will be accessed by people from my constituency. These are two very important services, but there will also be an early psychosis intervention centre rolled over the top of the Dandenong service and the Fountain Gate service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for La Trobe for his words. This is a campaign where, if governments do not take action, literally lives will be lost. I commend the motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, it saddens me deeply to rise to speak on this motion about a subject that has touched far too many in our great Australian family. Suicide is a terrible tragedy not just for those left behind but for those who are the victims. How alone, how abandoned and how desperate those people must have been before ending their lives. And indeed how long did they feel like this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It troubles me greatly that in a country as full of opportunity as ours that these people feel so isolated that they see suicide as the only available path. This troubles me even more when it comes to the brave men and women of the Australian Defence Force. The Gallipoli Barracks are located within my electorate of Ryan, and I have been to services for our returned fallen heroes where they are treated with all the respect and honour they deserve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, suicide is far too prevalent within our recently returned servicemen. Since 2000, 96 serving ADF personnel and 13 former ADF personnel that we know of have taken their own lives. This is despite Defence instituting a number of programs to address suicide and broader mental illness issues within the Defence Force. While the rate of suicide in the ADF is no greater than the rate in the general populace, it troubles me that people with easy access to quality care and counselling still choose to end their lives rather than seek help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must do more to end the stigma surrounding not only suicide but also, more importantly, seeking help for what, in most cases, are treatable illnesses. I also think it is time we stopped saying that a person died from suicide. While that may have been the act that ended their life, that act is a symptom of a problem. As friends of Robin Williams said following his death he did not die from suicide but from depression. Issues around mental illness are extremely complex. For example, a psychiatrist I know once told me that a person with bipolar who jumps off a building is not trying to suicide but are trying to fly. The result however is usually what we call suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also address the underlying issues in our national psyche to stop people, mostly young men, taking their lives. I know it sounds cliche but all the best research has found that talking to someone genuinely helps. It is best if that person is a professional but a sympathetic and understanding friend can do as well. There is no shame in asking for help. If you want to move a big item of furniture, you ask for help. If you need assistance cleaning up after a flood or disaster, you ask for help. But when it comes to their health, both mental and physical, many men simply do not ask for help. It takes more strength to ask for help than to not ask. And if a mate comes to you and wants you to listen, be proud that they thought enough of you to confide in you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation we have a suicide problem. Talking about it here and acknowledging the issue is a good start, but we must do more. As this motion says, more people die from suicide each year than in road accidents. Yet how many millions of dollars do our state governments spend on education programs on driver safety and road signage and improvement? How many millions of dollars do they make through enforcing speed limits to the slimmest of margins? How can they ignore the elephant in the room? I have been told informally by police officers that they consider at least a third of all single vehicle accidents to be suicide. If you removed those numbers from the road toll and added them to the figures for suicide then the road toll, while still worrying, will not be as big an issue as suicide. So I say to the state governments of Australia, 'Take a third of the money you spend on advertising road and driver safety and start educating people about mental illnessâor, better still, spend that money on actually treating mental illness.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that concerns and involves all Australians. We must have a national dialogue on how we address the leading cause of death among men under 44 and women under 34. I commend the motion to the House and I thank the member for LaTrobe for drawing attention to this important issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Suicide is the leading cause of death in Australia for men under 44 and for women under 34. More people die from suicide than from road accidents. Over the past five years the average number of suicide deaths per year in Australia was 2,415. These statistics are sobering and they are heartbreaking. Every year 400,000 Australians experience suicidal thoughts. Sixty-five thousand make suicide attempts. Thirty-five thousand are admitted to hospital for injuries incurred in the course of attempts to commit suicide. In 2012, 1,901 men and 634 women died through suicide. Some estimates put the costs of suicide to the economy at $17Â½ billion or one per cent of GDP per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, the financial cost of suicide is not the most important consideration. The most important consideration is that, behind each of these statistics, is a human story of grief, pain and suffering. As a college student, I will never forget learning of one of the young women of my college committing suicide. At that time, she was surrounded by people her own age, her peers, going through the college at the same time as her, and yet she was not able to be a survivor of suicide. As recently as last week I heard a story from a survivor of suicide, at the annual MATES in Construction charity lunch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">MATES in Construction is an organisation that assists with mental health issues in the construction industry. At that MATES in Construction annual lunch, Justin, from Jelly Belly Plumbing, told us that he was a survivor of suicide. The MATES in Construction lunch is aimed at encouraging participants in the building and construction industry to reach out to people in that industry and provide help when it comes to mental health. Of the people who died from suicide in 2012, 172 were construction workers. That is more than five times the number of construction workers who died in workplace accidents that yearâwhich is not to diminish the fact that any death in the workplace is one death too many; it is concerning that so many people from the construction industry that are taking their own life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">MATES in Construction is an organisation that is saving lives in the construction industry. It is an organisation that works to arrest and decline suicide rates in the construction industry. The construction industry is such a transient industry and lots of workers are employed from project to project for periods of as short as a few weeks at a time. A recent report by Professor Chris Doran, of the Hunter Medical Research Institute, found that, since the MATES in Construction program started in 2008 in Queenslandâwhich is where the program originated, though it is reaching out across the nation nowâthe risk of suicide in Queensland's construction industry has decreased by almost 10 per cent. So, as I say, they are saving lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really honoured to go to the charity lunch last week to represent Senator McLucas, and I was struck when I heard the stories from the supporters, the people around the table and those who spoke about just how effective the model has been. This is a model that is shared across industry. It is industry participants working in partnership to make a real difference to the lives of building and construction workers. For example, the lunch itself was promoted and sponsored by Hutchinsonâa great Queensland company in the building and construction industry. MATES in Construction is supported by employer organisations. I am reliably informed by the chair of the organisation that the QMBA worked very hard at the outset of the organisation to take internal steps to be able to become strong supporters and promoters of MATES in Construction, and I congratulate the Queensland Master Buildings Association for doing that. Other organisations that support MATES in Construction include Construction Skills Queensland, another industry based partnership model that is showing great and successful outcomes in Queensland, like other organisations such as the Services Industry College and the others that were present at the lunch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was really heartening was to see the way that unions and employers are working together to arrest and decline suicide in the industry. In fact, on my table I had representatives from great large companies like John Holland and Lend Lease, who are very strong supporters of MATES in Construction as well. It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth funding for this organisation will run out shortly. It is an organisation that costs around $800,000 a year to run, yet their work in preventing suicide returns a saving of about $3.6 million each year. I would encourage those on the government side of this House to work on ensuring that funding is continued for MATES in Construction into the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to a great manâa community leader who by anyone's measure was an inspiration and a role model. He was a friend of mine. His name is Gavin Jones. He took his own life in July at his farm at Goulburn, just near mine, at the age of 47. Gavin was perhaps best known as the founder of the Deadly Vibe Group which published <span style="font-style:italic;">Deadly Vibe</span> magazine and produced the Deadly Awards. The Deadlys started in Sydney two decades ago, celebrating achievement and excellence in the Indigenous community. I attended last year's event with Gavin. Great social entrepreneurs leave a legacy, and Gavin's legacy will loom large. He was able to lead and inspire others as few can. His simple, motivating ideaâthat we should celebrate Indigenous successâwill live on well beyond his life. Gavin's name is added to the list of many others Australia has lost to suicide this year. While we can never understand what motivates someone to take their own life, it is always a tragedy. As this motion before the House asserts, over the past five years alone average suicide deaths a year in Australia have exceeded 2,400âan absolutely shocking number.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Goulburn area, in my electorate of Hume, suicide rates are disturbingly high, particularly amongst young people. Preventing further suicides is a goal motivating many local families, a number who have already lost loved ones to suicide. In 2003 a Goulburn suicide working group was formed to look at positive ways to address the issues and to target risk-taking behaviours. The group identified a range of ways to reduce the risks of further suicides: greater community education across the communityâof course, suicide should not be a taboo subject; greater networking and information sharing between preventative agencies; and more readily available public information on suicide prevention as well as information to support families who are grieving. Research has shown that suicide and self-harm behaviour cuts across gender, race and socio-economic background. The Goulburn suicide working group identified that any genuine response needed a whole-of-community approach, collaborative work practices and government funding support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against this backdrop and after years of community campaigning, I was very proud to welcome the announcement last week of federal funding for a Headspace centre for Goulburn. Health Minister Peter Dutton announced that 15 new headspace centres will be established across Australia, including one at Goulburn, to provide mental-health services for young people aged 12 to 25. This will bring the total number of headspace centres in Australia to 100. Eleven of the new centres will be in regional Australia, recognising the special issues faced by rural and regional communities when it comes to youth depression and isolation. I feel great pride that we will be able to offer this for young people in Hume. It is not just for Goulburnâit is for the broader district. We held a celebratory morning tea at my office in Goulburn last Wednesday with tributes to the tireless efforts of many people who have campaigned for a headspace centre, including the late, great Trish Cunningham; Mayor Geoff Kettle; Simon Bennett from Anglicare and Jo Cunningham. Jo lost her own son, Hugo, to suicide in 2012. In hearing the headspace news, she said: 'You always have to find the positive out of something very, very negative, and that's what the community has done.' Thank you, Jo, for showing such courage and strength in seeing this through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We still need the local community to keep pulling together to ensure the headspace centre is everything we want and expect. It will take the best part of two years for it to be up and running, but knowing it is coming is a great motivator. The headspace centre is a great outcome for Goulburn, but there is still a lot of work we can do in terms of broader community education. Three-quarters of all mental illness manifests itself in people under 25. The links between mental illness, depression and suicide are well known and well documented so, as a caring community, we have a duty to continue finding new and better ways to raise awareness about the risks of suicide. After the tragic event of someone taking their life it can sometimes be said, oftentimes in fact, that there were no signs anything was wrongâthat there was nothing anyone could have done. As a caring community we need to look harder and we need to act sooner. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the motion by the member for La Trobe, and I thank the member for bringing this important matter to the attention of the House. It has also been a privilege to listen to earlier contributionsâin particular, that of the member for Hume, both at a personal level and in terms of his reflections on this issue as it affects his community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragically high number of suicides that the member for La Trobe has drawn the House's attention to gives us all pause for thought. I am sure we have all been touched by suicide and we have all struggled with questions of understanding and questions of responsibility at a personal level. The death of a friend or a family member leaves an empty space in lives, and a death which is sudden and perhaps avoidable leaves behind trauma and a sense of loss that stays with loved ones. All of us should strive to reach out to those in need, and this need can take many forms. However, we are here because we are recognising today that there is only so much individuals can do by themselvesâthere needs to be institutional support and indeed institutional understanding that supplements community and individual efforts. As the member for Holt said earlierâwe have not done enough in this regard, and this has been a bipartisan failing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am hopeful that there is now a bipartisan response, and I acknowledge the Howard government's watershed mental health spending in its 2006 budget, the largest allocation of spending on mental health for its timeânot before time. Part of this commitment was the establishment of Headspace facilities across Australia, and other members have acknowledged the role that these facilities are playing in their communities. Each Headspace centre employs a team of youth workers and mental health professionals. Headspace has already provided services to around 80,000 young people across centres in metropolitan, regional and remote areas. I am proud to say that Headspace has strong support from Labor. The former Labor government, in its 2011-12 budget, announced that the number of Headspace centres would be expanded by 30, and in the lead-up to the last election Labor committed $34 million to open another 10 Headspace centres, so that there would be 100 across the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Headspace, each year around one in seven teenagers and more than a quarter of 18 to 25 year olds will experience mental health problems and/or problems with alcohol and other drugs. We also knowâand the motion, importantly, recognisesâthat suicide is the leading cause of death amongst this group. Seventy-five per cent of mental health problems emerge before the age of 25, so early intervention in this area, as in so many areas of social policy, is critical. In outer suburban communities, including areas within the Scullin electorate, these issues are often exacerbated by limited access to mental health services, stigma, prohibitive costs and limited availability of transport as well as limited access to meaningful employment and, in many cases, education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the City of Whittlesea, 22,000 young people aged 15 to 24 live in this local government area, and potentially 5,600 of these people are experiencing mental health problems. So I was very pleased with last week's announcement of a new Headspace facility in Greensborough which will cater for young people in Melbourne's north-east. This has come after lobbying since the first inception of Headspace by local governments, groups and agencies as well as my predecessor, Harry Jenkins. The City of Whittlesea and the Shire of Nillumbik deserve special mention for their combined and innovative efforts on behalf of their constituencies as part of the North East Headspace Partnership group. The full aspect of their advocacy included an adjoining facility in South Morang, which was, unfortunately, omitted from the plans for the new Greensborough facility. This is a missed opportunity for an area that would benefit greatly from such a facility, an area of real need. I will continue to work with the community to lobby Headspace and the Australian government for a Headspace satellite facility to be located in South Morang, servicing those areas of the City of Whittlesea most in need. In the meantime, I look forward to working with my parliamentary colleagues, including the Minister for Health, in the spirit of bipartisanship, to make this a reality and, for all of us, doing more to end the tragic waste of young lives that this motion squarely addresses. It is all of our responsibility.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care is a vital service to over one million Australian families. It is a vital service that enables parents to fulfil their economic potential by returning to work and boosting workforce participation, which is essential to our economic performance. It also increases and improves early childhood education, which numerous studies have demonstrated can have a significant beneficial impact on the educational outcomes for our kids. Unfortunately, child care is a vital service that is under threat by over $1 billion worth of budget cuts by this government. One aspect of these cuts is a $157 million cut to family day care by changing the family day care component of the Community Support Program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family day care is an important part of the childcare apparatus in this country. It supports over 98,000 families, helps 165,000 children and employs more than 25,000 educators. This cut places severe pressure on the sector. Coalition speakers after me will argue one of two excuses for their actions. They will either claim that this action was necessary to stop examples of rorting by family day care providers or they will claim that it is not a cut; it is just a change in the eligibility, to better target the service. Neither excuse stacks up. Neither excuse is reasonable or believable. Both are pathetic justifications for a mean-spirited and counterproductive cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the first excuse, about rorting, if there is rorting it needs to be stamped out, but you do not do this by penalising the vast majority of family day care providers, who are doing the right thing. In fact, I would submit that, by reducing the support for the high-quality providers, more space will be opened up for cheap, fly-by-night operators. On the second excuse, about how this is just changing eligibility rather than being a cut, the fact is that, on the Department of Education's own figures, this change will mean that over 80 per cent of services will be denied funding. If it looks like a cut, walks like a cut and smells like a cut, it is a cutâand this budget cut is reflected in the budget papers, which quite clearly identify a $157 million saving to the budget bottom line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The end result of this is that family day care services will be forced to either increase fees, reduce services or close. The peak industry body for family day care services has estimated that the average impact of this budget cut will be an increase in family day care fees of $35 for a family. Let me repeat that: this cut will mean that the average family will pay $1,500 a year more in family day care. This is $1,500 that the average family can least afford to spend. This will have a massive impact, especially in regional areas, where family day care is more prevalent. I challenge any of the speakers from the other side who purport to represent regional areas to try and defend a cut that attacks regional areas so egregiously. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact in my area will be very severe. Lake Macquarie City Council provides a family day care service that is rated as exceeding national quality standards, and it provides this service to 719 families and 900 kids. It operates with 261 full-time equivalent staff, and this is equivalent to nearly seven childcare centres. It supports 90 small businesses, and there are 300 kids on the waiting list. Continuing delivery of this program will be much harder due to these cuts. It is just one of the many local services impacted by this heartless cut. I will continue to fight for the thousand families in my area impacted by this cut. I will continue to fight for affordable child care. I will continue to fight for the best early education for kids. I will continue to fight for the best support for parents to return to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need only contrast this heartless cut with the government's ridiculous Paid Parental Leave scheme. Their Paid Parental Leave scheme will provide $50,000 to wealthy families in North Sydney who have a child whereas over 80 per cent of eligible constituents in my area will receive less than $20,000. Even if this Paid Parental Leave scheme were delivered well, which it will not, the Grattan Institute has found that investment in childcare services is twice as effective as a Paid Parental Leave scheme in terms of improving workforce participation. We should keep in mind that this ridiculous, unequal Paid Parental Leave scheme will cost over $22 billion over the forward estimates, compared to the $154 million cut we are talking about here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  Both sides of this chamber value child care and the $28.5 billion that we spend every four years on it. Both sides would agree that we need to be looking after disadvantaged, remote and regional communities. Where we differ is on this motion. Normally the member for Charlton brings high-quality motions for debate here, but alas not today. This was a fund designed specifically to make sure that childcare services were available toâlet me say it againâremote, rural and disadvantaged communities. That was why the fund was created. If we did not have a problem with misdistribution, we would not have needed the community support fund. That is its job. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, in the end, large numbers of areas in Australia that do not have a disadvantaged, regional or remote population were accessing these funds. At some point you need a certain amount of ability to target resources, and that simply was not happening. What we have here is the notion that every childcare service, both family and long day care, is deserving, but not all of these services are remote, rural or disadvantaged. If those who are accessing the money are none of those three then a responsible government would do something about itâand an irresponsible government, like the Labor alternative, would not. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2006 the floodgates have been open and effectively this money, instead of being appropriately targeted, has been spread fairly homogenously across the sector. What of course happened was you did not actually fix the problems you set out to address. Of course you do not need to just ask me that. You can ask the Audit Office, which recognised that 80 per cent of these funds were being directed into areas other than where they were needed and so a refocusing was required. Do not even ask the Audit Office. Let us look at the name of the program. It is the Community Support Program. The CS in CSP is 'community support'. It is not the 'long day care support program' or the 'family day care support program'; it is the Community Support Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program is to look after communities that do not have access to the day care they need and look after the regional, remote areas of Australia where it is not viable and the highly disadvantaged areas where it is not economically viable to build a day care centre. That is the problem the government set out to fix, but we were left with the Labor alternative who really had no fiscal clue, did they? No. The Labor Partyâand I have said this beforeânever saw a special cause that they could not fund and they never saw a reason to take someone's dollars away without giving them to someone else, with no concern for quality. In the six years of the Labor government effectively we had a complete focus on the cash and no focus on the quality. So as long as the money was being taken from someone and given to someone else it really did not matter if any problems were fixed or not. That was the great challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were left with massive draw downs of nearly $200 million to keep funding a system of child care that was sending money off to the communities that did not need the money to remain viable. It simply went in to help with the operational costs of providing child care. But that is not the point of the fund. The fund was set up to fix inequities. It was set up to help communities that could not get day care, particularly family day care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bell is tolled in the motion from the opposition member. It says that up to 80 per cent of these services stand to lose, whatever that means. How on earth can 80 per cent of these services be at threat of non-viability? How can 80 per cent of the services all be disadvantaged, remote or regional? It is a preposterous case and it just shows that the program, as the Audit Office indicated, was poorly directly and not doing the job it was designed to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us remember that we are taking over from the Labor government that allowed childcare costs to skyrocket 53 per cent over the six years that they were in power. They promised us 222 childcare centres to end that double drop-off but barely built a dozen, probably due to simply the weakness of the will of the minister. Lastly, of course, we saw costs for families increase by $3,500 per child. As I said, they lost control of the agenda and simply started funnelling the money out for no good purpose. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments will have to slow down. They will have to calm down in tough periods and focus the money right. The point of the CSP was to ensure that there were childcare services all around Australia, even in areas where the member for Charlton has not visited and even in those remote parts of Australia where he will probably never visit. We know there are Australian families who deserve a childcare service that they can access so that they can go to work. Seasonal workers, harvest workers and mining workersâsure, they do not cross our paths every day, but they have just the same rights as those who live in the electorate of the member for Charlton in metropolitan Australia, which does not have the need for those extra subsidies. It is completely viable in many parts of metro Australia. I support the government's decision.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The contribution by the member for Bowman shows that he really does not understand the issue. My electorate is one of the lowest income electorates within Australia. ABS data will confirm that. I rise to support the member for Charlton's excellent motion on child care. In doing so I condemn the Abbott government on its short-sighted cuts to family day care. Furthermore, I call on the Abbott government to reverse its $157 million cut to family day care and in doing so I call on members opposite to stand up in their party room and tell the Prime Minister that they do not support this attack on Australian disadvantaged families. It is estimated that more than 80 per cent of family day care in Australia will lose funding, which will make those services unviable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family day care is a grassroots organisation which provides care to over 165,000 children across Australia, over 1,500 on the Central Coast of New South Wales and 900 in Lake Macquarie. Many of those children who receive family day care in Lake Macquarie and Wyong shire live in the Shortland electorate. Family day care also supports 98,000 families in Australia and 719 families in Lake Macquarie. This support enables the parents of those children receiving family day care to work or undertake study so they can ultimately obtain a job. The Abbott government says it wants all Australians to work, yet it is ripping funds from services that make this possible. This is unconscionable and must be reversed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mean-spirited Abbott government budget announced changes to the eligibility for family day care providers to access funding through the Community Support Program, a program that is designed to address disadvantageâand disadvantage across different areas: high levels of domestic violence, high levels of single parent families and high levels of unemployment. These are issues that are predominant in many areas within the Shortland electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lake Macquarie council will lose $300,000 from the Community Support Program from 30 June when the Department of Education will stop all community support contracts with family day care providers. All providers have to reapply for funding. In the Lake Macquarie part of Shortland family day care is provided by Lake Macquarie council and it currently operates with an average of 261 full-time places, which is equivalent to 6.5 child care centres providing 40 child care places. There are currently 298 children on the waiting list, of which 188 are less than two years old and 27 our unborn. It is cost neutral to Lake Macquarie council and relies on approximately $300,000 received from the Community Support Program to ensure high-quality education and care for children in the community and supports 90 educators who provide the service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Wyong Shire part of the Shortland electorate family day care is provided by Child and Family Services Wyong Shire Inc., a community-based organisation that provides child care to over 600 families and 860 children. It is one of the largest providers of child care in New South Wales and has been operating for 30 years. This service provides family support programs for around 1,500 children across the Central Coast and employs 160 people. The changes to the Community Support Program will equate to a loss of $250,000 to the Wyong program. The loss of these places in both services would be devastating in an environment where there is already a chronic child care shortage, with similarly long waiting lists in child care centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government promised to fix the problems families were having accessing child care before the election. Instead, it is ripping $157 million out of family day care and $1 billion out of child care. It is yet another example of the Abbott government saying one thing before the election and one thing after. You just cannot trust the Abbott government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241586" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  There is not a single member in the House who does not recognise the unique benefits of family day care as a child care option. Yet once again we have an opposition who begin a publicity rumour before the Productivity Commission has finalised their investigations. Phrases taken out of context from the draft are distorted, putting distress and disquiet in the minds of working parents, family day care educators and service facilitators. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family day care is one of the best child care options for a working parent. I say this with complete conviction as all three of my now grown children went to wonderful family day care homes. In Gilmore, we are blessed by having one of the stand-out examples of family day care service which is coordinated under the watchful and dedicated Helen Waterhouse employed by the Shoalhaven City Council. This service was recently audited and found to be exemplary for safety and educator training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In regional areas, family day care is one of the better options, where the tyranny of distance often means that the usual care hours of nine to five are completely impractical and it is essential to have a robust, sustainable and affordable delivery of services. As a past day care mum, I completely support this service. These surrogate families are outstanding and the standards are even better today, with the child care providers being innovative educators in their programing. I have been lucky enough to have seen some of this amazing material and it is very impressive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the strong growth in family day care services meant the budget blew out by almost $200 million. In 2012, the Australian National Audit Office reported to the Labor government, recommending a review of eligibility guidelines. This, unfortunately, was ignored, resulting yet again in another fine Labor mess to sort out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also some anomalies in family day care, with one example as follows. Some children nominated on a daily basis as being 'at risk' get fully funded hours of care, which seems more than reasonable until you find out that these children are being returned to homes where they are still at risk. Is this the best application of a family day care service? Surely even Labor can see that a) this is financially unsustainable, and b) even more importantly, it should trigger an assessment of the overall welfare of these children for alternate placement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No government program has a limitless bucket of available funding. There must be accountability. This is especially relevant for regional child care, the original catalyst for family day care funding. Since 2011, there has been a massive growth in family day care, but most this has been in metropolitan areas. It is important to remember that approved family day care services are still eligible to administer child care benefit and the child care rebate on behalf of families, regardless of changes to the CSP, and that families using family day care receive a rate of child care benefit that is more than 30 per cent higher than for other types of child care. The maximum rate of CCB for one child in family day care is $5.47 per hour compared to only $4.10 per hour for other types of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of eligibility criteria means that funds go to the greatest places of need. It also means that family day care services criteria are the same as other services such as long day care and outside school hours care. The cap of $250,000 placed on the amount of operational support funding from CSP that a family day care service can claim in any financial year means that the funds are more evenly distributed, especially to rural and regional Australia and especially to Gilmore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be noted that CSP is paid to family day care services, not to educators or parents. These changes do not impact on the ability of service operators to expand or open more services or to continue to provide care for the existing families. This shows that the government, far from attempting to reduce family day care, is making it more affordable for working parents, including budgeting $28.5 billion over four years to assist these families with childcare costs. It really is quite tiresome when those in opposition, having been warned that the system is unsustainable, that the funding guidelines need to be reviewed, do not have the guts to actually follow the advice they are given. And then they jump up and down in outrage when that same advice is actually acted upon on an issue that they deemed to be in the too-hard basket. Government is not about being popular; it is about making the best decisions for the long haul, listening to the stakeholders, acknowledging the wisdom of the reporting investigators and investing the dollars of Mr and Mrs Taxpayer in the most sustainable and equitable manner possible. This issue is about a flexible, fair, accessible and affordable suite of childcare options so that working Australians can get on with the job and work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I rise to also support the motion that has been moved today by the member for Charlton. It shows another example of cuts that have been made by this government to the early childhood education sector, and the cuts continue. This is $1 billion that has been cut from a sector that is vital not just for ensuring women's increased participation in the workforce but also ensuring the education of our youngest Australians. This particular motion relates to family day care services, which provide another option for families instead of enrolling their children in long day care. Family day care is an alternative option, and in regional Australia it is an important option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus on what this family day care model means for regional Australia. In a number of towns they do not have the population to sustain large or small classes of organised child care or early childhood education. Family day care is an alternative model and it is proving to be quite popular. There are some towns in my electorate that do not have a day care centre; they do not have formal child care. The option they do have is family day care that is being run from people's homes, predominantly by women as they establish themselves as small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing from this government's proposed cuts is that more than 80 per cent of all family day care services will lose funding from next year. Next year 80 per cent of services will lose fundingâin my electorate alone that is 16 servicesâand the majority of them will lose their funding or some form of funding as a result of this government's attacks on early childhood education. As I have mentioned, in some of our towns it is the only form of child care that is available. It is also a flexible model that does help parents who may be working shift work. It is a flexible modelâparents are able to enrol their children in family day care whether it be one day a week or for half daysâand it is a bit of a pay-as-you-go model. Currently a lot of the services in my area are full. They have waiting lists because some parents prefer the option of the family day care model. However, these services are under threat. What that means is that families in my electorate will have fewer options available to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are these: family day care has operated for more than 35 years; more than 94,000 families currently use family day care and more than 150,000 children are enrolled in family day care as I speak to this motion; there are more than 18,000 family day care educators. Most of those family day care educators are small operators, they are small businesses. Essentially the educator is also the owner of the small business. Family day care provides the majority of flexible non-standard hours of careâit is an alternative modelâand it is also part of the national quality framework that provides for early years education. These cuts to family day care are just another attack by this government on the national quality framework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious about ensuring that our youngest minds, our youngest Australians, have the best start in life, then we need to ensure that we can continue to fund the national quality framework and the services that underpin it whether it be preschool, early childhood education through childcare centres and long day care centres, or family day care. Concern about these funding cuts was first raised with me when I met with the CWA in my part of the world: the Mount Alexander CWA, the Castlemaine CWA and the Harcourt CWA branches presented me with a letter condemning this government for its funding cuts to family day care. They are an active network that ensures a number of single mums in the area have a service that they can rely on when they go for job interviews, when they do their mutual obligation to ensure they can continue to receive some form of benefit from the government. These cuts now put that service for those single families at risk, and that is one of the main reasons why I support this motion, which has been moved in support of and in defence of family day care.</span>

It is a chance for you to get up there and talk on something about which you are passionate. Normally you will see the mover of the motion stay in here so they can control the debate and hear what other people are saying, but such is the participation in this debate that these people just make a statement and walk out.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Charlton came in to talk about family day care. His first words were: 'I know what the government is going to say.' He does not have a plan for family day care. He wanted to take a quick pot shot at the government. The Labor Party will stand condemned for all time when it comes to day care. What was their response to the GFC? They were going to build 260 childcare centres. That was the big plan. We were going to declare war on child care and the lack of available spaces. They built 38 and said, 'Job done!'. That is 14 per cent. No wonder they always thought they could get to a surplus. They stand condemned for their words on child care.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence sought approval from the committee to provide new air combat capability facilities to support the acquisition of 72 F35A aircraft. The F35A aircraft are being purchased to replace the RAAF's current fleet of classic Hornets. When integrated fully into the Australian Defence Force, Australia's F35A fleet will deliver the air dominance and strike functions currently provided by the classic Hornet.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conducting this inquiry, the committee was mindful that it was assessing a project with a value of approximately $1Â½ billion and a timeframe of up to eight years until completion. As always, the Public Works Committee is bound by its act to consider and report on public works 'as expeditiously as is practicable'. The committee did its best to balance the need for an expeditious outcome with a level of inquiry commensurate with the value of the project.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee allowed five weeks to receive submissions from interested parties and it made two site inspectionsâat RAAF Bases Williamtown and Amberley in Queensland.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">RAAF Base Amberley is not part of the project being reported on today but the visit to the RAAF base allowed the committee to inspect the modern fighter facilities which are being used by the squadron which operates Super Hornet aircraft. These high-security facilities were completed in 2010 and are indicative of the type of facilities which will be built at RAAF bases in Williamtown and Tindal for the F35A aircraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At RAAF Base Williamtown the committee inspected the existing facilities which are being used by the classic Hornet squadrons. These facilities were built in the 1960s and 1980s and contrast starkly with the modern Super Hornet facilities at Amberley. The facilities proposed to support the F35A aircraft when they arrive at RAAF bases Williamtown and Tindal will be similar to those the committee saw at RAAF Base Amberley.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee held public and private hearings for the inquiry in the town of Raymond Terrace near RAAF Base Williamtown and also in Parliament House in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues of concern brought to the committee was whether the proposed extensions to either end of the runway in Williamtown could increase noise levels. The Hon. Bob Baldwin MP, federal member for Paterson, suggested in his submission to the inquiry that a less noisy option for some nearby residents would be to build a second runway instead of extending the existing runway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, Defence told the committee that there are a number of concerns with the option of a second runway, not least because it would need to go through the wetlands in the adjacent national park. The monetary and ecological costs would be significantly higher than extending the existing runway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence acknowledged that issues relating to noise will remain a concern to some nearby residents but told the committee that the proposed extension of the runway at Williamtown will in fact reduce noise impacts. An extended runway means that afterburners will not be used during the majority of take-offs and this will actually minimise the noise impacts on the base and surrounds. The committee is satisfied that the runway extension as proposed is appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee questioned Defence about the level of consultation that had taken place with community and other stakeholders, particularly in Williamtown and Tindal. Defence assured the committee that it undertook extensive community consultation to ensure that the public was informed about the project and had every opportunity to raise issues of concern or seek further information. In Williamtown, Defence has introduced a 'fly neighbourly' policy which included, it said, 'a robust engagement process with the community.' One of the outcomes of the policy is that aircraft now turn and fly over Grahamstown Dam to avoid the townships of Raymond Terrace and Medowie. This reduces noise over residential areas substantially. Since this process began, Defence has seen a significant drop-off in complaints from the community. The committee has asked Defence to continue to consult with local communities and interested parties to implement measures to mitigate noise impacts where possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee did not identify any issues of concern with Defence's proposal and is satisfied, on the basis of information provided, that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost. However, given the scope, length and cost of the project, the committee has requested that Defence provide a project update at regular agreed upon intervals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have already mentioned, this is a huge project in terms of both value and scope. The committee's inquiry was constrained by its obligation to report expeditiously. However, I believe that through the process of site inspections, taking submissions from a range of stakeholders and holding a number of public and private hearings that the committee has assessed the project to the best of its ability within the limited time available. Under these circumstances, the committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost, and recommends that the project proceed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to this important inquiry and my thanks, once again, goes to the secretariat. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leaveâNorfolk Island has historically been part of this nation since the establishment of a settlement shortly after the First Fleet landed in Sydney in 1788. Since becoming part of this country the political and governance arrangements have changed throughout its history. This can be seen in the different iterations in the nature of successive settlements. Despite these continuous changes, what has never changed is the beauty and the unique nature of the environment. In these ways Norfolk Island will always be a different world and those that visit the island will know what I mean.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2014, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Hon. Jamie Briggs, referred an inquiry into the prospects for economic development on Norfolk Island. The reference followed an audit report into Norfolk Island's finances which found, unequivocally, that the Norfolk Island administration is failing. That failure comes at a cost to many residents of the island. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a sharp downturn in tourism and employment in recent years and a declining population as residents seek work off-island. Progress on the Norfolk Island road mapâa process for reformâhas been too little, too late. Yet change is necessary. Norfolk Island would now be bankrupt if it were not for the Commonwealth's ongoing financial support. The condition of infrastructure is close to critical failure. Service delivery is not commensurate with Australian standards. The Norfolk Island government is failing to deliver on a range of responsibilities which are beyond its budget and management capability. It is the island's 1,600 residents that suffer the consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key message to emerge from the inquiry is that there is an urgent need for reform to achieve improved economic stability. This was voiced by all Norfolk Islanders, irrespective of their position on self-governance. The committee has made eight recommendations addressing the need for new governance arrangements, infrastructure investment and the framing of new economic opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first recommendation is to end self-government by repealing the Norfolk Island Act 1979. An interim administration should assist with transition to a local government type body. The committee recognises that the Norfolk Island community will need to be on board throughout the transition process. To support this, we recommend mechanisms for community consultation to facilitate the reform process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government assume responsibility for the overdue Cascade and Kingston Pier upgrades. The Commonwealth should also assume responsibility for the purchase of multipurpose barges. The barges will increase passenger offload capacity from cruise ships and will facilitate safety matters. The barges will also allow for containerisation and introduce modern freight-handling practices. Improving the island's public road infrastructure is another critical need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that officers be placed in the transitional administration to strengthen Norfolk Island's economic and human resources capacity. Tourism Australia and Austrade can offer advice and support to improve the existing tourist product, and to develop new products and services.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In April 2014, when the committee visited Norfolk Island, we were impressed by the quality of locally produced goods, including fresh produce and artefacts. The committee recommends a dedicated officer to help local businesses with product branding and to set up a cooperative and visible shopfront.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst on the island I found that the vast majority of people supported the end of self-government, but there is no doubt that some will resist the call to abolish self-governance. However, I am disturbed by reports that some supporters of self-government are now attempting to intimidate those that support change. There are those who will claim that ending self-governance will put Norfolk Island's unique history and culture at risk. I would argue the opposite is true. Working towards greater economic viability and sustainability is the surest way to keep Norfolk Island alive and vibrant for years to come.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee acknowledges those that made written submissions and gave evidence at hearings on Norfolk Island and in Canberra. I thank my committee colleagues for their strong bipartisan support. I also thank the secretariat for their outstanding organisational ability and excellent efforts through this inquiry. I conclude with the words of one young Norfolk Islander who told the committee:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Norfolk Islanders have the drive and passion to make the island succeed. The time has come for change.</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  "> Indeed, it is important to remember that funding for children with disability should be sector neutralâit should not matter whether it is a government-funded school or whether it is an independently-funded school. Supporting children with disability, indeed, should be sector neutral and, in essence, much of the bill that we are debating here today goes to reinforcing that. Absolutelyâas I was saying two weeks ago at 4.30, I think it was, on a Friday afternoonâfunding is important, and funding is increasing over the next four years quite significantly. In my home state of Tasmania, the federal government's contribution to government schools over the next four years increases by nearly 46 per cent. So, indeed, from the federal government's point of view, we are doing our bit, remembering that the federal government's contribution is only 15 per cent of all of that funding that goes to the government school sector.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are other things that are important in making sure that children get the right sort of education. Teachers are very much a part of what makes great schools. The way that teachers are trained and the capacity for teachers to have the confidence and the competency to enter the classroom and feel that they can impart the knowledge that they have learnt through their training are very important. The whole issue of classroom readiness was highlighted recently. The Australian School Survey has been completed and reported on in the last couple of weeks and it confirms the concerns that many teachers have, particularly young teachers who have left training college and are entering the workforce for the first time. Many do not feel totally in control in terms of being able to confidently impart knowledge onto their students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all seen wonderful teachers in our own experiences and the passion that they bring to their vocationâa vocation for many people that is a calling as much as anything else. But feeling unprepared in their ability to enter the classroom is something that we need to address. This is particularly the case for young teachers. Teacher quality is a critical thing alongside appropriate funding; as is school autonomy. That applies to the capacity of the school to be able to deliver the things that are often unique and relevant to the community where the school is based and the community where the students come from. That extends as much to the capacity of the leaders within that school community, not least of all the principal, to be able to make certain choices that are appropriate to the school environment. The best teachers in any system should be recognised and rewarded in the same way that teachers who are not up to the jobâand they are a minority of courseâshould be appropriately dealt with by principals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing more important than schoolchildren and making sure that our kids get the very best opportunities possible. That extends of course to the broader school community and to parental engagement. I was not necessarily engaged as much as I probably should have been over the course of my boys' school life, but my wife certainly did her share to participate and contribute to the schools where they attended over time. Having capacity within the school council and within the parents and friends association to support the school, the teachers and the academic staff is indeed very important. Finally, I welcome the work that is being done on the national curriculum. A strong and relevant curriculum is another component of making schools valuable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014, which has four major components. I want to deal in the first instance with the first of those: the support for Indigenous students in boarding schools. The bill will establish a new mechanism to allow the minister to make payments to schools for reasons prescribed by regulation. This will facilitate the payment of $6.8 million in 2014-15 to non-government boarding schools with more than 50 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boarders or more than 50 per cent of boarders who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. This funding was announced in the budget. Of course, support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students attending boarding school is absolutely consistent with Labor's policies in government to construct new boarding schools and help students from remote communities access boarding school education. I want to go particularly to the issue of boarding schools in my own electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, the budget allocated $28.9 million for three new boarding facilities in the Northern Territory to provide education support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander secondary students. The Indigenous Land Corporation, the ILC, also committed the contribution of $15 million, bringing the joint investment to $43.9 million. We know that three were to be built. The first was to be in Wadeye in the north-west of my electorateâa large community of about 3Â½ thousand people where there was a Catholic high school but no boarding facility. So we agreed with the community to build a boarding facility adjacent to the high school to look after the needs of kids not only in that community but also in surrounding communities where there was a large catchment population. That building went ahead. In the end, I think, in the order of about $24 million was spent. It is open and doing its business as it should. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What of the other two? One was to be built in north-east Arnhem Land and another in Central Australia in what is euphemistically called the Warlpiri triangleâthat is, the areas where Warlpiri communities predominate: Yuendumu, Lajamanu, Nyirripi and Willowra, and smaller communities in between. What happened was that we were unable to get final agreement around the siting of the one in the Warlpiri triangle, so that was put off. But we did get agreement in north-east Arnhem Land from the Yolngu people of Garrthalala to build a boarding facility there. Prior to the last election, contracts were let for that facility. Then when the Abbott government came into power, they stopped those contracts from proceeding. That meant effectively, despite the rhetoric which comes out of this government, that they had purposely and quite deliberately put a stop on the building of a boarding facility in a remote Aboriginal community dealing with Aboriginal kids in remote outstations of North-East Arnhem Landâquite deliberately. There is no excuse for it because there had been agreement by the communities that this was where they wanted this facility built. It meant that their kids would not have to go to Nhulunbuy or to some other facility in North-East Arnhem Land or, indeed, anywhere else across Australia to attend high school. They were denied access to years 11 and 12 unless they attended a boarding facility. That was to be understood because they come mostly from small homeland communities in North-East Arnhem Land. On 18 October 2012, Senator Scullion said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whether building these boarding schools in remote communities is of value or not is a question for another day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a question for another day; it is a question which he should have addressed then and which he should be addressing now by making sure that facility proceeds. The Yolngu people he met a number of weeks ago when he was there with the Prime Minister would have reaffirmed their desire to have this facility built at Garrthalala. The centre is also aware that a report commissioned by the Labor government in 2010 and conducted by KPMG recommended a boarding facility for remote students in North-East Arnhem Land be established atâwhere do you think?âGarrthalala. In answer to a question asked by Senator Scullion in a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations on 31 May 2012, the department's response referred to a feasibility study. The answer included:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">KPMG assessed seven main options for locating the facilityâclose to one of each of the five Indigenous communities, in addition to a homeland and non-community location.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government's extensive discussions and consultation in the region clearly demonstrated a high-level of community buy-in and willingness to invest in the decision of placing the facility at Garrthalala.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Garrthalala community has a well-documented commitment to education, and a strong desire to host the facility, building upon the small residential school program that it has been running successfully for homeland students for several years. It was this strong support from the local community for education, and the surrounding outstations, together with the secure environment, that led the Government to the decision to proceed with building the boarding facility in Garrthalala.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The key to the siting of this facility is the provision of a safe and secure environment where students can learn free of negative social issues and influences. Based on the report, Garrthalala was clearly the site that offered the best safety and security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it then that this boarding facility has not been built? How can, on the one hand, the government be arguing for kids going away to boarding facilities, yet when there is a community ready and willing to host a boarding facility for the region, to address the needs of the Yolngu Aboriginal kids of North-East Arnhem Land, they will not allow it to happen. This smacks of hypocrisy. The Prime Minister would have been told about this when he was in North-East Arnhem Land and Senator Scullion would have been told again and again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are told that Senator Scullion is to go back to North-East Arnhem Land to report to the North-East Arnhem Land Regional Economic Development Committee as a result of the visit from the Prime Minister. It was to be done by 17 October. Do you think he has done it? My word! Of course not. That I think is a further demonstration of the commitment that this government has, in reality, to those people of North-East Arnhem Land. The government go on about the importance of education and boarding facilities, yet kids are sent to Scotch College or to Adelaide, Melbourne, Darwin or anywhere else, while these people, who have a real hunger for education, are denied the opportunity to educate their kids in their home communities. What does that say about this government?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory is the site for a number of experiments by this government, one of which is the Remote School Attendance Strategy. We know that thus far this strategy has cost $46 million. As a result of that investment, in the first term there was an increase of 11 per cent in school attendance across Australia. In the second term, that dropped to six per cent on the baseline and in term 3, it has remained constant at six per cent. That tells us that the strategy is not working and it is not working for a range of reasons. We know that in some communitiesâI can name Yuendumu and Santa Teresa, Ali Curung and Thaliaâattendance has gone backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I met some of the school attendance officers and they are committed to doing their work. In some communities clearly they work very effectively. In one community last week school attendance was about 80 per cent but we know that, at the same time that this government is spending $46 millionâI understand people in this government have become almost apoplectic at its dismal results, the flat-lining of this dataâthey have not achieved the outcomes they wanted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the last government, the Commonwealth government committed sufficient resources to fund 200 extra teachers for remote Indigenous schools in the Northern Territory. Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, you would be aware of this because I know you were here, that you were listening. Would it surprise you to hear that the Northern Territory is committed to providing only 100 to 170 of those teachers, that 30 teachers are no longer to be put in bush schools? They have been relocated for some other function in headquarters or wherever they may be. Apparently, there is a plan to reduce that number by another 35. So, instead of 200 additional teachers funded by the Commonwealth working in remote communities to address the abysmal outcomes for education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids in the Northern Territory, what are we going to see? We are going to see a reduction already of 30; now there will be another 35 potentially so that 200 becomes 135. That means that almost every significant school in the Northern Territory will lose a teacher, and you have to ask yourself: how fair dinkum can this government be, on the one hand blaming parentsâbecause that is what they are doing about not having the kids go to schoolâwhile shifting bucketfuls of money out the backdoor and not providing the teaching resources that these schools require?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The formula does not work. It cannot work. You cannot, on the one hand, demand that you have more kids in the school and if you are lucky to get them thereâand in some communities they comeâthen put additional pressure on the school. There will be kids who have not been to school for three, four or five years and they are put in next to kids who have been going to school regularly. What sort of demands does that place on the school community?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory governmentâwhat has it done? It has announced $250 million worth of cuts to education resources in bush schools over the forward estimates, and $50 million thus far. That means support teachers in schools. That means teachers in schools so, while the Commonwealth is blaming parents and trying to get kids into schoolâa good idea: we all want kids to go to schoolâthese children rock up to some of these schools and cannot get the education they deserve because there aren't the resources. Why aren't there the resources? Because the Northern Territory government has withdrawn them. Don't blame Aboriginal parents for that; blame the Northern Territory government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many ways in which you can look at this, but those of us who have been involved in education in the Northern Territory, as I wasâas a teacher and subsequently as an observer and participant in the communityâunderstand what this means. The first opportunity that Aboriginal kids in remote schools had to go to high school was in 2001, because when the Labor government was elected they introduced years 11 and 12 to these major communitiesâcommunities of 3,000 people where there was no high school. Now we hear the Northern Territory government is proposing to close them. They are apparently going to send all these kids off to boarding schools somewhere else. You don't have to be Einstein to work out what the results are going to be in many of these instances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw that Fred Chaney put out a statement the other day talking about the new funding arrangement, the IAS fundsâ150 programs reduced to five; and 1400 organisations bidding for $4.8 billion in funds. Do you know what this includes? This includes bidding for school nutrition programs. This means schools in the Northern Territory who have had a nutrition program now have to bid to have those programs continue. Who in their right mind has thought of this? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mind bogglesâthe inanity of what goes on in the public policy space in education within this government and their failure to grasp. They need to pounce on the Northern Territory government, bring them to heel and make sure they do what they should be doing for the communities of the Northern Territory and not doing what they are doing at the moment: selling Aboriginal people down the drain. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In urban areas, while there is plenty more to do, we have come a long way in the last 10 or 20 years and are slowly closing the gap between Indigenous and mainstream Australia. As I said, we have much more to do. There are lots of specialised services in those communities, particularly in the health sector. But in the main, education is mainstreamed, and there are good option for students to, firstly, engage in primary school then secondary school and gain a good quality education as it should be in the local high school or area schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In remote Australia, it is different not because the schools we have are badâin fact there has been a huge amount of money invested in the schooling system and teaching resources over the yearsâbut the whole package is bad. It is just not delivering for those students, despite huge investments, as I have said, in housing and health. Children are born into communities where due to poor hygiene, for instance, most suffer some level of hearing loss by the time they start school. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember vividly visiting a community on the APY Lands about two years ago where the principal pointed out that they had recently had hearing tests done on the students. Out of 260, they found three good ears. How difficult must it be when you start school: you can't hear properly and are actually speaking in a different language, and so the gap is there before they start? In fact the teachers in these classrooms now use an audio surround fill-in system where the teacher wears a microphone. There is a speaker in each corner of the classroom just so the students can hear what is going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children in these communities are born into households where no-one works, or at least not regularly, in communities where the only work is in government employment programs or being employed by the government to deliver servicesâoften in the health sector and perhaps in the education sector, normally not at the top level but as assistants in the schools as SSOs and perhaps in environmental programs funded by governments. But it is not the norm to have industry operating in these communities and it is often not the norm to have somebody from that household going off to work each day. Violence, alcohol abuse and sexual abuse are, unfortunately, commonânot in every household but in enough that the children can consider such behaviour to be the norm. It becomes the general form of the way that community operates. I have often been into communities and have seen violence occurring in the street and the children standing around watching.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many issues, and governments of all persuasions have tried to hard to address them. In those remote communities there are far more police now living on site. There is new housing, health centres, art centres, family centres, youth centres, employment programs, civil works, environmental programs and tourism. But, unfortunately, we are still losing ground. It is one of those great conundrums. When I go into these communities and I speak to the people who are delivering these myriad programs, they will all convince you earnestlyâand I believe themâthat they think they are doing a good job and are making a real difference, whether it be in education, health or family management. But, in fact, the overall outcomes are getting worse. So we are collectively losing ground. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the APY Lands, which I mentioned earlier, there are more than 100 organisations and programs operating. Many of them do not know what the other is doing, but most of them are convinced they are doing a good job. But we are not making progress. So what do we do to break this cycle? I see absolutely no answerâand I know the minister concurs with thisâbut in education; a path to empowerment. I hope an empowered next generation will have the confidence to leave the remote lands and venture into mainstream society and take their place there full of confidenceâthat they will have, as I think Noel Pearson has said, the confidence and ability to walk in both worlds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again on the APY Lands, about 2Â½ thousand people live there. They occupy 10 per cent of the state of South Australia on freehold title. It is not the most fertile ground. Most people would consider it to be desert. But it is valuable pastoral land. Probably 50 years ago, 200 or 250 people would have been employed to run the cattle propertiesâgood grazing country. But, now, if those properties were operating properly you would probably need a staff of about 10 to 20âwith modern mustering methods, motorbikes, computer and telemetry controlled operating water systems and automatic drafting yards on the watering spots. What this means is that this country can still be very productive but it is unlikely ever to employ hundreds of people to operate those industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from that, there is no natural economy. We might get lucky. Perhaps a prospector will discover a major resource project and get it off the groundâbut, considering how difficult it would be in that part of the world, it is not highly likely. So, generally, speaking there is no natural economy. As I said, most employment is subsidised by the government in one way or another. Probably the best operating private businesses out there are the art centres, which do provide an income for those who spend the most hours there and get the best at their jobâso it is a very good signalâbut they do not operate without government support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So if the inhabitants, the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people, want real jobs for their children, like many parents in the countryâlike myself and my wifeâprobably the best option is to get them into a boarding school. It was not something I particularly enjoyed when our children were growing upâto send them away to school at the age of 15. Some have lived back at home in my community for short periods since, but it is highly likely that none of them will choose to settle there. I must say, too, that, as a third-generation farmer, in my family there is a strong feeling of affinity to our land. I do not claim to have the same religiously significant affinity as the Aboriginal communities, but it is certainly a tear for children to move away from their families and their land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming from that point of view, I understand, as much as I can, these issues for those who live in remote Indigenous communities. They do not want their children to leave. But as parents we also had to make the tough decisions and say, 'The best opportunity for you is to go forth in the world and have a go.' In the case of my family, that has meant that three of them have professional qualifications and are spread from Canberra to the Riverland and to Adelaide, and they come home and visit us. I know it is a tough question for those who live on the lands. When I sit down with the elders thereâwith the women and the menâthey say that they would really like their children to be employed and to come back to their communities. But, as I went through before, there is no natural economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also concerns me greatly that so many of the programs of governments generally across Australia have been to maintain these communities in their natural environment. But, as I see the breakdown of culture, with another 20 years of what we have been doing, there will be no culture left to protect. In fact, it is being eroded daily. There is a lack of respect for the elders. Drugs, alcohol and violence are riddling these communities. The opportunity of boarding school not only is an opportunity to get a good education but also provides a circuit breaker. The kids can actually have a look at a different lifeâa life where they know they are safe; a life where success is the norm; a life where people go to work five days a week and maybe more. That is what these kids need to see. Then they need to think, 'I want a piece of that.' And when each one of them makes a move into the wider world and says, 'I am going to change my life,' I celebrate that as a great outcome. We cannot do that if we do not have good schooling systems, and we cannot get them into secondary school and into boarding schools where they can compete unless we can break the conundrum of getting them to a level at year 5. Once again Noel Pearson says, 'I want the children that go through the Cape York schooling system to be able at the end of year 5 to go into any school in Australia and be able to operate on an even standing with the other children as they approach year 6.' I think that until we can reach that level, we have not made it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some reference made to the school attendance officers on the lands in the remote communities around Australia. The minister has announced that in 200 communities next year a form of direct instruction, or basic phonetics education, will be introduced. I must say when I went to Cape York, Aurukun and Hope Valley I was greatly impressed with the direct instruction model; it seemed to me it was actually making a measurable and very large difference. If I can see that in my remote communities, I will be very pleased. The member for Lingiari said the school attendance model is not working as well as it should, but if it is six per cent or 11 per cent, that is six per cent or 11 per cent more than we had going last year. From what I have seen on the ground, these programs work where we have the right leadership, and they work less well where we have resistance from within the particular school or poor leadership on the ground for the school-attendance officers. We have to keep working at that. If we have resistant principals or resistant teachers in the school, then perhaps they are the ones who need to go. If we have poor leadership on the ground, let us get rid of the ones we have and find some new ones. Unless we can break this model we are consigning these people to an ever-worsening outcome for their descendants. For me that is simply just not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to have a look at Wiltja in Adelaide, which is the government boarding school. This extra funding is not aimed at that particular facility at the moment. I must say I am impressed with the boarding school there, where the students from the APY lands in particular, but also those from other remote communities I mentioned earlier, are being well looked after. I do somewhat question whether a boarding school that has a 100 per cent Indigenous enrolment is actually preparing these kids properly for what they are going to find outside the school gate and the boarding house gate. I do like the model that sees students being enrolled in private schoolsâbut they could be government boarding schools if we ran that type of arrangementâwhere they are mixed. When I say 'mixed' I mean mixed by background, mixed by race. I think the reality of the outside world is that Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians have to work together shoulder to shoulder. I applaud the minister for this move in supporting boarding schools and their ability to engage Indigenous students, and I hope it leads to more construction of boarding schools and higher numbers of students.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  It is my great pleasure to be speaking on the subject matter of education and the Australian Education Amendment bill. I will say at the outset that it is not so much what is in the bill that attracts the attention of members on this side of the House, but the things that are not in the bill and the mess that surrounds it. If there is one thing that has been consistent about this minister and this government's approach to educationâwhether it is early childhood education or primary, secondary or tertiary educationâit is this: they have buggered up everything they have touched. In the 12 short months that they have been in government they have absolutely made a mess of everything that they have touched when it comes to the education sector. I was at my own universityâthe University of Wollongong, a fine institutionâin the Illawarra this week, where they are facing redundancies because of the 20 per cent cut in university funding. You have academics, students and community members up in arms because of the uncertainty surrounding higher education. This has been a critical institution in the Illawarra for giving kids from ordinary working-class backgrounds, like my own, an opportunity in life and a foot on the ladder of opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not so much what is in the bill that attracts our ire, although there are some things that do warrant some attention that are within the legislationâit is the stuff that surrounds it. It is the absolute mess that Minister Pyne has made in his 12 months in the job when it comes to higher education. The first part of the bill attracts our supportâthe support for Indigenous students in boarding schools, the provisions within the bill that will allow the minister to make payments of up to $6.8 million in 2014-15 to non-government boarding schools that have more than 50 Indigenous boarders or more than 50 per cent of their total population who are Indigenous students. This is something that we supportâit is consistent with Labor's policies when in government to construct new boarding schoolsâparticularly to support measures which will assist us in closing the gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians when it comes to their life expectancy. There is bipartisan support for the Closing the Gap targets and bipartisan support when it comes to closing the gap between non-Indigenous and Indigenous life expectancy and mortality rates. But this goes to the issue of closing the gap in education and employment outcomes: ensuring that we have access to early childhood education for all Indigenous students four years old in remote communities by 2013âthat is a bipartisan proposition, initiated by Labor; halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements; and halving the gap in year 12 retention rates for Indigenous students by 2020. All of these are designed to ensure that Indigenous students are able to enjoy the same life opportunities as non-Indigenous Australians. Sensible measures which are directed at these propositions will enjoy our support, and this part of the legislation does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of the legislation is a solution to a problem of the government's own making. This is the provision which will change the funding transition rules so that funding is indexed by at least three per cent per annum. Without this change, around 38 schools would face funding cuts in 2015. I stress this point: we would not need to be in parliament today debating this provision if the government had not stuffed it up, if the government had put in place the election promises that they went to the 2013 election with. If they had done what they promised to do, we would not be needing to debate this provision within the House today. It is because the government have broken their pre-election promises that we need to put in place this workaround, this fix-up. Had they honoured their bipartisan commitment to the Gonski reform arrangements, we would not be needing to pass this amendment here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third proposition is about delaying the implementation of the school improvement plans by one year. They are going to be delayed to January 2016. What are the school improvement plans? Quite simply, they are the requirement on schools who are receiving additional funding from the federal government to put in place measures to prove that they are actually addressing those educational outcomes that the funding is in respect of. I have got to say that this is the part where the minister has absolutely jumped the shark. We have a proposition by the minister that he does not believe in command-and-control requirements for school funding systems. So he is essentially tearing up that part of the Gonski school funding agreement and saying, 'We need to start again.' In light of their history on this issue, you really do have to be a little bit cynical about a proposition from a Liberal Party Minister for Education that rejects command-and-control propositions when it comes to school funding by the Commonwealth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us on this side of the House remember the 2004 plan by the then Liberal minister, Brendan Nelson, to tie the requirement for receiving school education fundsâthe $33 billion in Commonwealth fundingâto sticking a flagpole in the schoolyard. That is right: these enemies of command and control were saying, from 2004-05, that, if a school wanted to receive any of its Commonwealth government funding, it had to stick a flagpole in the yard of the school. I have no problems withâin fact I supportâthe proposition that schools have flagpoles, and I support the provision of flags to schools, as most good members do. But, when you look at the coalition's history, you have got to ask yourself how genuine they are when they say, 'We're not into this command-and-control stuff; we'll just hand money out to schools without any conditions upon it; we won't ask what they're doing with the money.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the guys who started the culture wars when it came to school curriculum. These are the guys that could not find enough opportunities to bag the schoolteachers in the public school system. They required that schools have a flagpole in order to receive Commonwealth government funding, and yet they stand here today and say, 'We need to put this legislation before the House because we do not like those provisions of the Gonski school education plan that require some conditionalities upon the additional funding.' You have got to ask yourself: is this just a ruse for the government to once again back away from what was said before the election about a bipartisan commitment to the Gonski school education plan? We all remember Chris Pyne saying that you could not put a cigarette paper between the Labor Party and the coalition parties when it came to school education funding and the Gonski plan. We know they have torn up the funding agreement. You have got to ask yourself whether this is just another ruse to enable them to completely back away from every and each part of that funding plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the minister likes to stand up and say they are still honouring their proposition, but they are the only Liberal government in the country which claim that they are honouring the Gonski school education funding agreement. In fact, last week we had the National Party Minister for Education for New South Wales, Adrian Piccoli, say quite clearly that they signed a six-year funding agreement, a contractual arrangement, with the Commonwealth, and they signed it because they could see that this was to the benefit of every student in every school in New South Wales, and they think that the federal education minister, Christopher Pyne, has reneged on that agreement, has torn up the agreement, and they will be taking steps within their power to ensure that it is honoured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it important? We know that the Gonski school education review was the most comprehensive review of school education in over 40 years. At its core the proposition was this: public or private does not matter; we want to ensure that as a Commonwealth and as state governments we are funding schools on the basis of need. Schools with higher need students, whether they are students from low-SES backgrounds or students from Indigenous backgrounds and whether they are schools with a higher proportion of students with disabilities, are the schools that should attract a greater amount of state and Commonwealth funding, and we will put in place a funding formula to ensure that that occurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not make sense if the Commonwealth is putting more money in the top of the bucket and state governments are putting a hole in the bottom of the bucket and draining it out for other programs, so it is absolutely critical that you have a joined up response from federal and state governments and from the non-government school sector. That is what Labor managed to do, and it was not easy getting around the table an reaching agreement with the first ministers of all the states and territories around the country. But do it we did with all but one exception, and agreement was reached.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But almost the first actâin fact, one of the quickest retreats from a promiseâwas this minister, Christopher Pyne, breaking his promise to the Australian people and tearing up the Gonski school education plan and funding agreement with the state and territory ministers. If it were not for that act, the legislation before the House today would not be necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will not be seen as standing in the way of a provision which is going to provide more funds to Indigenous students who are attending boarding schools, particularly those boarding schools which have a high proportion of Indigenous students. We will not stand in the way of ensuring those independent schools have their funding indexed so they can continue to operate over the next two years without funding cuts. We also will not do anything to stop the rest of the schools receiving their increased funding under Labor's improvements to the school education funding arrangement. We will not do it in a way that lets those opposite get off scot-free. People need to know when they go to the next election which side of politics stands for education in this country; which side of politics can be trusted when it makes a promise in relation to early childhood, primary, secondary, university or TAFE education; which side of politics is truly committed to investing more money in our kids and universities; and which side of politics cannot be trusted to keep their promises, because, every time they have made a promise when it comes to higher educationâevery time they have made a promise when it comes to school education-they have broken their promises. The people of Australia will not forget that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Australia will not forget that the Minister for Education cannot be trusted when it comes to education. If he has made a promise on it, you can be guaranteed that, if he is re-elected, he is going to break that promise. The people of Australia need to be and will be reminded of that. They will not forget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, the students from my region at the University of Wollongong will not forget that. They are red hot with anger because they know that this government which is cutting funds to schools is also now cutting funds to universities. It is going to mean higher fees for them. It is going to mean fewer academic staff teaching them. It is going to mean a reduction in the number and quality of services. So we support the legislation but not without reservations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  It is a pleasure for me to contribute to the debate on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014. It must be confusing for those listening to the presentations made by members with regard to what is being said in the chamber. What I do know is that the passionate response of the member for Lingiari to proposals in this bill reflects his electorate, as did the member for Grey when he spoke very wisely about how this bill affects people in his electorate and took the opportunity to explain to the House how his electorate and Indigenous communities work and where he saw it going. He wanted to break the cycle through education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education has been an issue in this House for the whole time that I have been here. It has been contentious. Everybodyâeach government, each communityâhas their own view about how education can best be delivered to our generations of children and adults. Having said that, who is right in the chamber? Is it the member for Throsby, who gave the atypical political speech about education? Is it the member for Lingiari, who passionately talked about his electorate and the effects on the Indigenous community? Is it the member for Grey or any other person making a contribution here? Who is right? Certainly the public listening to the debate would not have the faintest idea who is right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Throsby must have forgotten or have some amnesia with regard to the $2.3 billion they took out of higher education in their last budget before they were defeated. Is that forgotten? Come on; it cannot be. Yes, the nation has been left with a fair amount of debt. This government has to address it in every area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I especially wanted to talk about education as it affects you whether or not you are an Indigenous person, whether you are red, yellow, black or white. It does not matter. It means that our kids are important. We not only have to send a message to our children; we have to send a message to their parents about their dedication. The member for Lyons in a candid admission today in his address in this House said he was not heavily involved in his boys' education. He said his wife was. She carried the burden for the family with regard to the education for the boys. I would fit that bill myself. I think that, though I have sat on a number of school boards over the years and contributed locallyâmy children went to secondary college at Pakenham and have done wellâI have to say I was not around a lot. Often the burden is taken up by your partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to find a way to send a message to the whole of my community about the importance of education, and I have to take every opportunity. As this year roller-coasters towards Christmas and the New Year and soon will be into another year and all the thankyous will have been said; and the HSC results would have come out, and the futures would have been written, they think, on just that resultâand it is not the truth. That result is not the be all and end all of a life given and life's opportunity. But education creates the opportunities. Not in every case. Not in mine, for sure. I think my education began with the bumps and scratches of life, as I stand here today with more bumps and more scratches. So I wrote:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Christmas we the people of Gippsland from North, South, East or West, recognise that education is the greatest gift we can give our children. Universal access to learning, the Christmas present that keeps on giving, empowers our children to reach their full potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What more can we do to enhance our collective national progress, building a cohesive society based on tolerance and respect, than through the best education for our children our nation can afford.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Life-long learning reduces poverty, creates better jobs and increases the health and well-being of every Australian. As our children are one third of our population and all of our future, it is right and just that we gift in full measure to the next generation. Through the precious commitment of our teachers we claim for our children greater heights and success than we of this generation ever dreamed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put that to the House in all the consideration on education, all the blaming of the other side for what they have not done, let us encourage those in this House in tertiary education, in TAFE, in secondary college, in primary school, in early development education. They talked about day care providers being educators now; I think let the kids play. But let not this be a playground in this House. Let this not be a playground. Let us debate sensibly education in this place, in a bipartisan manner that gives the best opportunity for future generationsâour childrenâthe best opportunity to reach their full potential we as parliamentarians can possibly give them. I thank the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms OWENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I am pleased also to be speaking on education, and I acknowledge the member for McMillan's contribution. Before I start addressing the bill I would like to say one thing in response to him: it would be wonderful if this House could be bipartisan at all times, but the unfortunate truth is that we on this side of the House to not agree with the direction that the government is taking on education. We do not agree with the walking away from the full Gonski reforms, we do not agree in the cuts to early childhood education, and we do not believe that the approach the government is taking to education is going to put our children in the best possible place in the future. It is our duty as members of this place to say so. That is actually what we do here. I would love for us to be able to be bipartisan. We thought we were on Gonski. Immediately prior to the election the opposition of the time, now the government, were saying they supported Gonski in full. We had a moment, we thought, of bipartisan support for what had been tens of thousands of hours of consultation and a program of improvement that had the support of stakeholders all around the country. We thought we had that immediately prior to the election. But immediately after the election the government walked away from its bipartisan commitment to Gonski. The government broke its promise. We are here today debating a bill which exists because the government broke its promise. It exists because the government said one thing before the election and walked away immediately after. If they had kept their promise to implement the Gonski loading for students with disabilities, for example, in 2015 and provide extra resourcesâa very clear promiseâwe would not be here today looking at a makeshift, short-term answer to compensate schools for cuts in funding because the government walked away, ran away some would say, from that commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us now look at the bill in a bit more detail. The bill does provide extra support for Indigenous students in boarding schools, and that would have to be seen at face value as a very positive thing. Boarding schools play an incredibly important role, particularly for Indigenous students from remote communities. They provide access to curriculum flexibility that students need in order to go on to higher education. So they are incredibly important for remote students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new mechanism will allow the minister to make payments to schools for a reason prescribed by regulation and it will facilitate the payment of $6.8 billion this financial year to non-government boarding schools with more than 50 Indigenous borders or more than 50 per cent of boarders who are Indigenous. Again, it must be seen as a positive thing for the students who will actually attend what in most cases are very large private schools such as grammar schools. There are a couple of schools in my electorate that would meet those requirements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is consistent with the policies by the previous Labor government, except that we were also constructing new boarding schools to help students from remote communities access boarding school education. Again, nobody in this House could argue against the provision of $6.8 million to the larger boarding schools to assist Indigenous students who are attending school there. From the man who wanted to be the Prime Minister for Indigenous affairs, $6.8 million for Indigenous children who are largely going to large private schools cannot be criticised, but, in light of the half  a billion dollars in cuts to Indigenous funding, there is a great deal that needs to be said about this. Closing the Gap needs more than just finding a few of the larger boarding schools. In fact, it needs a great deal more, and what can be criticised other cuts to Indigenous funding that rip away other support that help children prepare for school, do well at school and go on to further education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts to Indigenous funding at up to well over half a billion dollars and it includes $9.5 million from support for Indigenous languages in schools. So we have lost $9.5 million for support for Indigenous languages, which must be seen as incredibly important also, and we have $6.8 billion going into boarding schools. So, again, you compare what has been cut in order to fund this. The questions must be asked about the wisdom of cutting programs which assist Indigenous children in many other ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also ripped $46 million from the Remote Jobs and Communities Program to fund a truancy army in remote Australia. We have lost $46 million from the Remote Jobs and Communities Program, also an incredibly important program. In the case of early childhood, which the member for McMillan also referred to, the previous federal Labor government invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the National Partnership Agreement on Indigenous Early Childhood Development. The purpose of that money was to make sure that young Indigenous children would get the best possible chance at life by establishing 38 children and families centres around the country. We know from all the research that the work that is done in that zero to four age group sets a child up for school. The improvement in a child's capacity to learn is greater than the entire first seven years of primary school. It is more important to the outcomes of education than perhaps any other part of a child's life, and yet the Abbott government has abandoned those centres. It refused to fund them when the partnership expired on 30 June this year, and we know from talking to those centres that many of them face a real prospect of closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had hundreds of millions of dollars ripped out of early childhood services for Indigenous Australians. Again, what has been cut in order to fund this $6.8 million for Indigenous students in boarding schools? On the subject of Gonski, before the election there was not a cigarette paperânot a sliver of lightâbetween the two parties. There was bipartisan support for Gonski, but the Gonski model provided a special Indigenous loading to ensure that those schools with Indigenous students were properly resourced to provide the best possible education for Indigenous studentsâand the government, of course, has walked away from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities are incredibly important. In my electorate of Parramatta, the University of Western Sydney surprised me when I first ran for parliament in 2004. They told me that the number of Indigenous students enrolled at the University of Western Sydney had decreased under the 12 years of the Howard government. Rather than seeing an improvement in the numbers of Indigenous students attending university, we actually saw a decline during those 12 years of the Howard government. But, under the former Labor government, there was a 26 per cent increase in Indigenous students going on to and graduating from universityâagain, quite a big change in what is a relatively short period of time and, again, we have seen the Abbott government cut the funding from those programs. Where is the actual commitment to Indigenous education? We are seeing hundreds of millions of dollars cut out of Indigenous education by this government. You cannot argue with the positive side of $6.8 million going into boarding schools that house Indigenous students, but we need to look at it from the helicopter view of what else is going.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in this bill are some changes to funding for students with disabilities. Under the Gonski model, there were six areas of need that received extra loadings: small schools, remote schools, Indigenous students, students with poor English, disadvantaged schools and students with disabilities. The first five were fully funded; disabilities, though, the sixth one, required extensive consultation and was delayed. If you look at it, states have different approaches and current state models range from $4,000 to $40,000 per student depending on a broad range of factors. So it was an incredibly hard policy area and we wanted time to implement it for 2015. As an interim measure, though, Labor funded the $100 million transition program, which was called More Support for Students with Disabilities. The minister says that the $2.4 million which is going to special independent schools is required to prevent a funding cut because the safety net will disappear. But the safety net that he is talking about is actually that Labor transition program, More Support for Students with Disabilities, which the government have decided not to continue. So they cut the safety net and then, because the safety net is cut, provide an extra $2.4 million to ensure that schools do not go backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How far we have fallen in the debate on education. How far we have fallen from just a year ago, when we were talking about lifting every boat and making sure that every child had a better education. How far we have fallen from standing in this House, looking at providing $2.4 million so that independent schools that deal with children with special needs do not actually go backwards in 2015. By 2015, the Gonski loading for children with disabilities was supposed to be in place, and the government, then in opposition, prior to the last election promised it would be. They promised that in 2015 it would be ready because they would do the work required to implement that loading. Instead, we are standing in this House today voting on a bill which provides $2.4 million to make sure that those schools do not go backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week is the National Week of Deaf People. Putting aside the debate that I know goes on in my community about whether deafness is a disability, these are young people in the early stages of their lives who need the extra assistance that the Gonski loading would have provided. They needed it; we promised it; the opposition, now the government, promised itâand they have walked away from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for McMillan called for bipartisanship, which would be wonderful. If we want bipartisanship in this House, there is a very easy way to get it, and that is for the government to honour their election commitments and fully fund Gonski, as they promised to do, and do it in the timetable in which they promised. Then we would revert to the bipartisan position that we were in just over a year ago. That is how long it has beenâa year ago, we were in agreement. A year ago, schools were expecting to get their loading. A year ago, schools were making plans. Now they are not and we are in this House looking at ways to ensure that schools do not go backwards. We are looking at a bill that provides $2.4 million to ensure that schools do not go backwards. We are looking at a bill that provides $6.8 million for Indigenous students attending boarding schools, but we are doing that in the context of billions of dollars in reductions of funding to schools because of the decisions that the government have made since they came to office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to this government: we would love bipartisanship. Please come to the table and do for education in Australia what we as a nation need and what our students need. We need an education system which can compete with the world. We do not need to be in here looking at ways to ensure that funding does not go backwards as an interim, bodgied-up measure because you could not keep your election promises.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has launched proceedings in the Federal Court alleging unconscionable conduct by the Coles supermarket chain in some extraordinary arrangements asserted against its suppliers. If the ACCC is right, it appears that Coles sought to make suppliers responsible for the supermarket achieving its own profit projections. Indeed, where those projections were not met, Coles would email suppliers with a demand that the profit gap be made good. Within Coles, this phenomenon was termed 'perfect profit' and the day on which Coles executives made demands on suppliers, with deadlines ranging from a few days to three hours, was referred to as 'perfect profit day'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In one email lodged with the ACCC, a Coles manager wrote to staff saying: 'Our profit budget is a given â¦ Ring suppliers today if you are short on profit.' In addition, there is evidence that, in cases where Coles had decided to discontinue the sale of certain products and proceeded to discount them sharply for the sake of clearing the stock, Coles then turned to the supplier to make good the gap in expected profit that Coles had inflicted on itself. Here is the market at work in Australia's version of modern consumer capitalism: a dominant corporate giant decides not only the price it will pay to wholesalers and suppliers, but also what profit it will make. It then places unconscionable pressure on the supplier to fund this projected profit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am glad that the ACCC is taking action against this alleged misuse of market power which, if established, is frankly disgusting. It is a perfect example of the shortcomings of the market and the need for strong and properly resourced regulation and regulatory oversight.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  Nowra Wrap With Love is a fantastic local community organisation in my electorate which meets in Nowra to knit, crochet and have a cuppa and a friendly chat on the first Tuesday of every month. In 2013, Nowra Wrap With Love supplied 316 wraps, which were each about the size of a single bed, to the Wrap With Love headquarters in Sydney for packing and preparation before being shipped overseas to people in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Wrap With Love movement across Australia delivered over 22,000 wraps to places like Armenia, Mongolia, Cambodia, Nepal, the Philippines, Madagascar, Sierra Leone and Argentina, and another 10,000 were delivered direct to World Vision for use in nations across Africa. On top of over 300 wraps and blankets for those suffering from cold across the globe, our local Wrap With Love group also generously makes knee rugs, cot covers, baby jackets and more for the local Shoalhaven hospital's oncology, renal, maternity and children's wards, as well as knee rugs for a number of local nursing homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month I was pleased to drop into one of Wrap With Love's monthly local meetings at the Nowra Library and donated more than 40 squares knitted by my staff especially for the group. I hope this will help the group make at least a few more wraps for those in need, both at home and overseas. Congratulations to everyone involved and especially to Mrs Rae Watson for kindly facilitating the Nowra chapter of this amazing international initiative. I thank her for her words of encouragement to start knitting squares in my own spare time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Right across rural Australia, wind farms for the generation of clean energy are bringing enormous benefits to rural communitiesâbringing investment, jobs, good environmental outcomes and, very importantly, off-farm income for some struggling farmers. They are also helping expand the contracting revenue bases of local government authorities. All this is being threatened by the Prime Minister's dogmatic attack on the renewable energy target which drives investment in this sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Ararat last Friday and there I met with the mayors of the Ararat, Pyrenees and Northern Grampians shire councils. Unsurprisingly, this attack on the renewable energy target is of the greatest concern for the mayors and those who live in their local government areas. They are very concerned that the drying-up of investment in this sector will cost them thousands of jobs in their local regions, undermining council's revenue base and denying those farmers that precious on-farm incomeâsome of which is already arriving and some which is hoped to arrive in the future.</span>

With an average of 54,000 visitors to Takarakka per year, the proprietors of the resort saw a growing demand for exclusive high-end accommodation for visitors wishing to enjoy the area with a little more comfort than the average camper. The new studio accommodation is situated adjacent to natural bushland and the sounds of Carnarvon creek running nearby.</span>

They came to tell me about their End Poverty Roadtrip experiences in advocacy, meeting ordinary Australians and speaking with them about the challenges faced in eradicating extreme poverty around the world. They spoke to me of the interest and support they had received, in diverse parts of Victoria, on their way to Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also came to make clear to meâas they didâthat young people in the Scullin electorate are passionately committed to ending extreme poverty. I started the meeting supportive of their concerns and I ended it much more firmly committed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that last week we marked International Anti-Poverty Day. I acknowledge that in the last 20 years extreme poverty has been halved with one billion people lifted out of poverty, but there is so much more to be done. We must contribute our fair shareâto date, we are not doing so. I agree with Oaktree that this is not good enough, so I say in this place, as I said to them: firstly, on the eve of the G20 we must do more to combat global corporate tax avoidance and, secondly, we must commit, and I am personally committed, to increasing our foreign aid commitment to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2020 and 0.7 per cent by 2025. This is in contrast to this government's approach that is seeing the most vulnerable around the world pay the heaviest price for its misguided austerity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  In the last election campaign the coalition government made an election promise to give $4.5 million to the Ballina Hospital. In the same election campaign the previous Labor government made an election commitment to give $3 million to the emergency department at the Casino hospital. I have got good news, Mr Deputy Speaker. The $4.5 million we allocated to the Ballina Hospital for new imaging equipment and a new operating theatre will be going ahead, but I was also able to convince the health minister to honour the previous government's commitment of a new emergency department at Casino. I visited the hospital soon after the election and saw that it was badly needed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we announced the good news that Woollam Constructions had been awarded the tender to redevelop the emergency department at the Casino and District Memorial Hospital. This new emergency department will include: a new triage area; two new resuscitation bays; ambulance entry, which will be redesigned for all-weather and safer entry and exit of ambulances; four new treatment bays; relocation of the waiting area to be in close proximity to the reception and triage; piped medical gasses to be provided to the emergency department's resuscitation bays; a multifunctional safe assessment room; a dedicated staff room; a public toilet in closer proximity to the waiting room; a refurbished clean utility room; and improved security. This hospital badly needs it and I am pleased to announce the new tender.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  I rise today to speak about Little River Primary School and their out-of-hours school care program. Little River is a community of 750 people, a local shop, a hotel and a small primary school in the electorate of Lalor. I was very pleased to accompany the member for Lalor to visit the school community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August this year, staff and parents of the Little River Primary School were shocked to learn that due to the reclassification status of their school to an urban city school, they will lose $16,000 in Commonwealth funding for their out-of-school hours care program. If you took the driveâlike I did, with the member for Laborâyou would soon realise that this is not an urban city school. If parents at the Little River community are denied access to this critical service because of an erroneous reclassification parents may be forced to change schools or leave the township entirely. This would have a devastating impact on the Little River Primary School and the town itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am callingâas has the member for Lalorâon the government to use its discretionary power to reverse this cut. These families of Little River need this service. I do note that the member for Lalor has written to the government about this on numerous occasions. It is now time for the minister to act. Please respond, Minister. Please change this disastrous decision.</span>

Under Labor, Australians were misled about the cost and progress of the NBN. After spending $6.5 billion, less than two per cent of Australians could order a service on the NBN. Our government is working hard to get the NBN back on track.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further north, NBN fixed wireless is now up and running in Dereel, Linton, Rokewood, Smythesdale, Cape Clear and Ross Creek. This technology will deliver speeds of up to 25 megabits per secondâaround double the average ADSL2 speed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  On behalf of our community I congratulate the mighty South Sydney Rabbitohs on winning the 2014 NRL premiership. The Rabbitohs first grand final win since 1971 has uplifted our community. It has been wonderful to see members of the community wearing their red and green and to see homes and businesses draped in the club's colours. But, most importantly, it has been wonderful to see the smiles on the faces of young kids who have fulfilled the dream of seeing their team win a grand final. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a long journey back for Souths since they were booted out of the competition in 1999. But they never gave up and many have worked hard to see them get where they are todayâNo. 1.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to congratulate and thank George Piggins; Nick Pappas and the board; Russell Crowe; Peter Holmes a Court; Shane Richardson; the management team at the Rabbitohs; and, most importantly, the team, led ably by Maroubra boy Johnny Sutton. Thank you for your sacrifice, your hard work and your determination to become No. 1 again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay special tribute to the coach, Michael Maguire, who summed up Souths' evolution a couple of days before the grand final when he said, 'With Souths we used to hope, now we believe.' Michael Maguire has instilled that belief in the team, it has resulted in a premiership and he is worthy of the praise of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be a lifelong Rabbitohs supporter and I am honoured to have worked with the team, the management and Souths Cares, their charity arm. I look forward to working with the Rabbitohs in the future. Up the mighty Rabbitohs!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  When we picture the hard-hitting field of a rugby union game, strong burly men quickly spring to mind. Today I want to break down this image and talk about women's rugby. I have recently had the honour of being appointed the ambassador for the Central Coast Rugby Sevens Women's Tournament, which will be held on 25 and 26 October at the Morrie Breen Oval, Wyong Leagues Club. This tournament is getting bigger and better each year. I am delighted to be involved to promote equality in sport. The tournament is leading the way towards achieving equality by acknowledging the outstanding level of competition this women's tournament delivers. This year the women's prize will be a record $12,000, making the Central Coast sevens one of the richest women's rugby sevens tournaments in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the opportunity to catch up with tournament director Craig Morgan and some of the players, including Melanie, Jayme, Kristie and Melaea, from the Central Coast Academy of Sport women's sevens team. Women from the Central Coast academy team this weekend will showcase their skills against the best in the world. The tournament will feature four of the top 10 world ranked teams in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Fiji. Also featured will be national teams from New Zealand, Japan and the United States of America.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Craig Morgan for his dedication and commitment to sevens rugby and for what I am sure will be a successful fourth year of rugby sevens competition on the Central Coast. I wish the Central Coast women's team all the very best at next weekend's competition. I have no doubt that they will do the Central Coast proud against the star-studded international teams.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  We want our country to be innovative, creative and dynamic. For that reason I was pleased two weekends ago to attend the Opti-MINDS national final at the University of Queensland. Hundreds of students, teachers, parents, academics and industry experts all came together to celebrate and recognise the substantial knowledge and ideas in the minds of our young people. It was a fantastic weekend which helped encourage that creativity, cooperation and innovation among the primary and high school students there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went along to specifically support the three schools from my electorate who were taking part in the weekend. I want to congratulate the kids from Crestmead State School, Kingston State College and Marsden State High School for their efforts. I want to thank one of our great local teachers Anthea Swile for the hard work she did as the Brisbane South Regional Director of Opti-MINDS. Thanks also go to Fiona Meyer, who has been the Director of Opti-MINDS for the last two decades and has been a real driving force throughout its entire 25-year history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of the young people I spoke to on the day had a great time and learned a lot from the experience. There was a lot to learn from their enthusiasm and ideas as well. Students came up with plans and programs to tackle problems as diverse as climate change, mental health issues, environmental pests and cybersafety. Congratulations once again go to all the participants and organisers at Opti-MINDS. I look forward to seeing you again next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  As we approach another Australian summer I rise to recognise the important work of surf-lifesaving clubs throughout Australia and also in my electorate of Hindmarsh. As we know, the purpose of surf-lifesaving clubs is to save lives and create a safe environment for all who enjoy our great beaches. I was at West Beach surf club with my children on the weekend. I commend the group leaders of the nippers and juniors programs who were out in their orange vests protecting the children as they learnt the challenges of the waves and the beaches. It was a happy day. It was great to see so many parents out there assisting. Well done to everyone.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surf Life Saving South Australia held their annual awards recently recognising the exceptional performance of athletes, volunteers and lifesavers over the last season. I congratulate all the recipients, especially those from the Hindmarsh electorate, including Phil Hogan of Henley Surf Life Saving Club, who won volunteer of the year. I would also like to congratulate and recognise the 16 volunteers who committed more than 150 hours of their summer last season to helping their respective communities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Somerton Surf Life Saving Club in my electorate was also crowned South Australian Surf Club of the Yearâa fantastic achievement. I attended their club opening recently, so I thank the club for their great hospitality. They were also the first club to reach 1,000 members in a season, so they have done some great things. As we know, the coalition government has also provided money to surf-lifesaving clubs around Australia in recognition of their great work.</span>

I want to give a shout out to all the year 12s in Lalor who are preparing for exams or completing assessment tasks.

These schools will all see their first cohort complete year 12 this year. What a fine job they are doing as new schools. They will join the other schools in exam preparation, organisation of valedictory and graduation celebrations and year 12 celebration days. Completion of year 12 with a VCE, VCAL or a joint certificate is an achievement well worth celebrating. I want to give special wishes to those entering the exam period and to their families who often at this time of year feel enormous pressure. To the parents I say: be patient, be encouraging and keep them fed and watered. Good luck to all.</span>

Well done. Mental health is a key issue in Australia, with almost half the population experiencing a mental health disorder at some time during their lifetime. Our national broadcaster launched its biggest cross-platform programming event on Monday, 6 October to raise awareness and funds for mental illness and by Saturday morning had raised over $1 million for mental health research and, much more importantly, raised our national awareness of mental illness.</span>

I was struck by the story of Tim Watt from Mt Gambier that was broadcast during Mental Health Week as part of the Mental As campaign. His story is emblematic of so many men in regional communities. Tim described the expectations that he would carry on as an invincible man and perpetuate the myth that farmers do not need to talk about pain and loss. This is despite the fact that his brother had committed suicide at age 20, an incident that Tim did not dare speak of for 23 years. Whilst his statement, 'In agriculture we are meant to be bulletproof, we are meant to be as tough as nails,' rings true for many, it is just as true that everyone needs to speak from time to time and it is good for men to talk about the issues they face.</span>

The team of cyclists was led by Danish Canberran Bjarne Kragh, and included: a firefighter, an ambulance officer, physiotherapists, public servants, a lawyer, a medical student and a medical doctor. </span>

September was Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Tragically, Australia has one of the highest rates of childhood cancer in the world. Every year, 600 Australian children are diagnosed with cancer, and every week childhood cancer claims the lives of three Australian children.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the guidance of Mrs Jane Marks, the students entered the 2014 Focus on Ability Short Film Competition. Now in its sixth year and run by the not-for-profit organisation Nova Employment, the competition is aimed at raising the awareness of the abilities of people with a disability. The film <span style="font-style:italic;">Open Your Eyes</span> asks the viewer what do they see when they see the star of the film, Phil Acheson. Mr Acheson has a disability, and the film suggests that it is easy to focus on the disability that we see, and not what abilities a person may have. Through a montage of scenes we see that Mr Acheson needs help to live each day with a disability, but at the end it is revealed that the beautiful piano music that has been used to provide the soundtrack is actually being played by Mr Acheson.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The film won the judges' choice short film prize and I am confident that the $15,000 prize package won by the school is nothing compared to the pride Mrs Marks has for her students. I would like to congratulate Mrs Marks and the Geneva Christian School for allowing the students to engage in such a productive learning environment. Special congratulations go to Sarah Marks, Joradanne Turner, Jackson Marks, Lewis Lamont, Steven Green, Riley Lodge, and of course the very talented, Phil Acheson.

Because of federal government funding cuts to core programs they have had to restructure their budget and as a result have made two women, well respected in the area, redundant. </span>

One particular woman who spoke to me about this, said that she was devastated that the women who have worked with her for the last few years will no longer be able to help her.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  On 8 October I was delighted to go to the western rural section of my seat of Ryan in Brisbane, to Mt Crosby. Mt Crosby State School hosted radio station 96.5FM to one of their community breakfasts. Radio 96.5 regularly have these fabulous community breakfasts where they go out to a school and learn from the local people about the benefits of living in that area and the strengths and characteristics of that area. So it was wonderful to be there with the whole of the Mt Crosby community and the school community to welcome Robbie, Liam and Ness, the morning announcers from 96.5FM, and their 'radio dog' Romeo. There was a small hiccup; I understood Romeo to be a real dog so I took doggy treats for him. He turned out to be someone dressed in a dog outfit. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I rise today as my electorate of Newcastle is split by a digital divide of haves and have-nots. This morning, rollout maps released by NBN Co confirmed that build preparation for fixed line NBN has commenced for large parts of Newcastle, including the CBD, with an estimated 47,000 premises having access if they can afford the cost of connection to the node.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This of course is a rollout of the Minister for Communications' less reliable, slower, second-rate, fibre-to-the-node pilot NBN program. While I note that access to a broadband network of sorts is welcomed by some, questions remain for large parts of my electorate, some areas of which have no access to broadband whatsoever. That's right; in 2014 some residents and businesses in Newcastleâthe second-largest city in New South Wales and the seventh-largest city in Australiaâdo not have access to reliable broadband through any service provider. And today's announcement brings them no comfort or answers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> I particularly note the suburb of Thornton. Residents of Thornton have contacted me on numerous occasions to indicate they have no access to a broadband service at all. The Minister for Communications' own department confirmed in their audit that parts of the suburb have the worst possible access level to some of the poorest quality ADSL broadband in the country. I ask the minister again, as I have done in writing on numerous occasions: when will residents and businesses in Thornton have access to broadbandâyour second-rate network or otherwise?</span>

The reality is that this government is playing its role in providing financial support and assisting wherever else we can in addressing the outbreak of Ebola in Africa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter of concern, I think, to all citizens of the world to endeavour to make our people as safe as we possibly can be from an epidemic of this nature. The response needs to be on many fronts. Firstly, addressing the immediate needs of those people who have contracted the disease and to attempt to treat those who have been affected. Then we also need to endeavour to avoid the spread of the disease to other parts of the world. I also think that it is fundamentally important for us to try to address what measures can be taken to develop a cure for this disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that Australia has a capacity to assist in all of those regards. Recently, the Prime Minister, while on his travel to Indonesia, called into New Guinea to make it clear that we were prepared to assist in the event of there being an outbreak in those countries nearby us. We provided financial support to the World Health Organisation and others who are involved in the treatment of this particular outbreak. We have also, of course, been talking to other countries about how we may be able to work with them, especially if Australians are to be deployed into this effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of Australians are already working in Africa of their own volition. We recognise the danger that they have exposed themselves to and their humanitarian effort in seeking to be a part of that exercise. Minister Bishop has been talking to countries overseas about how we may be able to cooperate with them in the event of us sending volunteers who may have to be evacuated. As the House will be aware, it is some 30 hours flying time from Africa back to Australia and it is incumbent upon any government proposing to place workers in a country that has this disease to ensure that we have an exit strategy, and that we have ways in which people who may become infected are able to come back to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So our response has been, I think, appropriate in the circumstances. We remain willing and keen to do what we can to assist in every possible way. We are making financial contributions now. I note that the UN task force has been particularly gratified by the fact that Australia has made a further contribution, which the leader of the task force has identified as being an example to other countries.</span>

It is of course right that Australia should make a prudent and proportionate contribution to what is essentially a humanitarian operation to protect the people of Iraq by combating ISIL and by endeavouring to restore law and order to Iraq.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a decision that the government has taken lightly. Ultimately, it is Iraq that must defeat ISIL. But it cannot be left to confront this horrendous situation alone. Australia is reluctant to reach out to conflicts thousands of miles away, but this conflict has reached out to us. This has been a conflict which is engaging Western nations because of the actions and the barbarity of ISIL. For instance, their latest statement, calling on supporters to target civilians of Western nations wherever they can be found, and their revolting boast about enslaving Yazidi women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 6 October, Australian aircraft have been conducting combat missions against ISIL targets in Iraq. These aircraft have been flying quite long missions to achieve the time that they need over the ground in Iraq. The FA18 fighters have flown more than 40 sorties. The air-to-air refuelerâthe KC 30Aâhas flown 13 air-to-air missions and provided over a million pounds of fuel to coalition aircraft. On 8 October, our FA18s struck an ISIL facility, which through subsequent battle damage assessment was confirmed to be destroyed. A number of ISIL members were killed in the attack. Two pairs of FA-18 fighters attacked ISIL military equipment and facilities in northern Iraq using their 500-pound bombs on 14 October. Defence has provided advice that those attacks were also successful.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have reached an agreement with Iraq on the legal framework for our special forces to be deployed to assist and advise the Iraqi security forces. Defence are now working through the necessary arrangements to enable that deployment to take place. Our Defence personnel are engaged in a difficult and dangerous task but it is an important one for the security of our nation and of others. And our thoughts and prayers are certainly with them on this mission.</span>

It is 30 hours flying time. We do not have aircraft in Australia suitable to make that kind of a transfer so we will need to work constructively with other countries.</span>

Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies continue to work extremely hard and cooperatively to make sure that Australians are secure and safe from the threat of terrorism. This effort starts on home soil and is led by our joint counter-terrorism teams, which are located in each and every Australian capital city. These teams bring together the Australian Federal Police, ASIO and state law enforcement agencies to work side by side in each of the jurisdictions. Whilst we are never happy when these terms are called into action more frequently, the government is very confident that the arrangements we have in place work effectively in preventing and detecting terrorism threats. The joint counter-terrorism teams recently led Australia's largest-ever counter-terrorism raids conducted in New South Wales and also in Queensland and Victoria last month. I commend them on their continued hard and effective work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am happy to inform the House that last week the Brisbane joint counter-terrorism team late additional charges against a 22-year-old Brisbane man arrested as a result of the Brisbane raids codenamed Operation Bolton. This man now faces a total of seven charges. The additional charges relate to preparing for a terrorist act and for possessing machetes, knives, balaclavas, military fatigues, fuel and a firearm in preparation to commit that act. In Australia, if you are found guilty of preparing for a terrorist act, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. The additional charges come as a result of the ongoing investigations into this man's activities including his alleged preparations to go and fight in Syria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The escalating security crisis in Iraq and Syria poses an increasing threat to Australia. Over 60 Australians are believed to be on the ground fighting in Syria and Iraq and approximately 100 are providing funding or facilitation. The number of Australians with hands-on terrorist training and experience is now several times what it has been when Australia has faced similar situations in the conflicts in Afghanistan. And, subsequently, the challenge in addressing this threat of returned foreign fighters and violent extremists is significantly harder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that countering the threat of terrorism requires a combined national and international response. As well as working cooperatively domestically with states and territories, we continue to work cooperatively with our international partners. This is one of the reasons we have provided an additional $630 million for our law enforcement and security agencies and we will continue to make sure they have the resources, the technical skills and the legislative backing to keep Australia safe.</span>

In 2011, the assistant minister attacked a three per cent wage increase offered to Defence personnel as 'outrageous' because it was below inflation. The assistant minister's current offer is 1Â½ per cent and cuts Christmas and recreational leave. If three per cent was 'outrageous' then, how does the assistant minister describe his own government's pay offer? Is it cheap, is it shameful, is that appalling or just an absolute disgrace?</span>

If we were to pay our fighting men and women 1.5 per cent more, do you know what that equals? It equals two weeks of the interest bill that the previous government left us. That is itâjust two weeks of their interest bill! We could pay an extra 1.5 per cent to our soldiersâ</span>

If the Leader of the Opposition is so concerned about how much we can afford to pay our soldiers, our sailors and our air men and women, a dialogue could be started between the Labor Party and this government in the Senate to clear $20 billion worth of savings. The opposition cannot sit there and claim that we should be paying more funds when those funds are not available, when they are stuck in the Senate because the opposition is not being constructive. And you talk about shameless opportunism!</span>

Albury Wodonga Health is a cross-border provider, treating patients and the community in Victoria and New South Wales equally. If the proposed boundaries of the Murray Primary Health Network come into existence it will destroy years of hard work aligning and delivering an outstanding cross-border health service. Will the minister consider realigning the Murray network boundaries to retain the current Albury-Wodonga cross-border arrangements?</span>

                  </a>  This is a concept that is foreign to Labor at both the state and federal levels because, when they were in power in New South Wales and in Queensland, they took money away from doctors and they put it into bureaucratic structure. That is what the Labor Party do. That is not what this government will do. We want to take money away from the spin doctors that Labor employ and we want to put it back into the hands of the real doctors and nurses so that we can get the sort of health outcomes that the honourable member would want for her local community.</span>

That is a possible outcome in this process; we will see how the tender process goes. The objective of this government is to have the PHNs collaborate but also compete against each other so that wherever possible, yes, we can keep people out of expensive hospitals, provide support in community settings and in primary care settings. The Labor Party, of course, wanted to put money into bureaucratic structures.</span>

She will be pleased to know, as will her constituents, that in dealing with this current threat, this elevated level of threat of counter-terrorism, we as a government are dealing with from a greater position of strength than we certainly inherited. When we are dealing with this issue, we are dealing with an environment where our border agencies have had $700 million of cuts reversed by this government to put greater support and resources on our borders to ensure that we act from a position of strength. We are also integrating our border agencies with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to ensure that we act from a position of strength. This government is also not acting from a position of weakness, where our borders were surrendered, where crisis and chaos rained down on the previous government, completely overwhelming their border agencies because of the border chaos. It has been 85 days since the last solitary people-smuggling venture to this country. We are coming from a position of strengthâ</span>

Further, by 2017-18, Defence will employee 735 more military and 775 more reserve personnel. Furthermore, this government is reinstating the '1,000-person gap year' that that Labor government took awayâthat is, over 2Â½ thousand new people coming back in.</span>

                  </a>  The $16 billion ripped out also helps with that shrinking. We have been rebuilding the Defence budget. We have been rebuilding the number of fighting force members. We are adding more than 1Â½ thousand over the next few years. We are adding an extra 1,000 in terms of the gap year. When you look at those increases in personnel, you start to get an idea of where the personnel budget is going to.</span>

That is an extra quarter of a billion dollars. When we pay people in Defence every fortnight it is a lot of money. An extra pay period is an extra quarter of a billion dollars. That does not seem like a lot of money to the Labor opposition because they are used to pulling $16 billion out. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: instead of politicking, why don't you simply stand up today sir and apologise to the Defence men and women for the $16 billion your government pulled out?</span>

As a dairy farmer she, probably more than most others, would want to know about the future of agriculture as designed in this green paper. The member for Forrest, after getting married, went straight back to the farm. It was like, 'I love you and you love me, so let's hold hands and go and get the cows and milk them.' The member for Forrest has two childrenâKim and Kylie. I think Kim is still on the land.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is extremely important that we understand that the future of agriculture has got to have a deliberative path. I am happy with the fact that we have received over 680 submissions from the Australian people on this green paper. It is a formative document and it goes to the essence of what being on the land is about. It is about getting a fair return at the farm gate. It is about making sure that with the overwhelming work done by the farmer more of it actually gets back to the farmer, because we know that if they do not make the money they are not actually going to invest in their farm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would be aware, Madam Speaker, that in 1900 the farmer got about 85 per cent of the final retail price of their produce. By 1950, it was down to about 50 per cent. Today, it is about between 10 and 15 per cent. And this is for the people who actually do the work.</span>

                  </a>  Well, you might not think they do the work but have you actually been on a farm? We have to make sure we give the capacity and outline the capacity for a greater return to come back. In some instances, this might be by reaching further down the production chain and by the utilisation of cooperatives. In some instances, it requires infrastructure of government. I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the marvellous work he has doneâthe $300 million that he has put on the table for the inland rail.</span>

But we have more to do. This is a document that I ask the Australian people to go over and to also make sure that they are a part ofâas we head towards a white paper. We know that the white paper becomes policy, and that becomes the future of our nation. That is how the member for Forrest, and for Kim and for Kylie, get a future on the land.</span>

Minister, it is now eight months since you announced with some fanfare your drought assistance package for farmers. How much has the government actually paid in drought assistance to farming families and how many farming families have benefited from that drought assistance?</span>

He would be happy to know that over 4,000 applications have been approved for the farm household allowance. This is a substantial amount of money. This means that they are receiving between $900 and $1,000 a fortnight. We have actually changed conditions so that we can bring dignity back into these people's lives. We have actually made it happen. You would be happy to know, Madam Speaker, that we approved $280 million in our drought package and concessional rates of four per cent. We have put money on the tableâover $22 million for other water infrastructure. These are the sorts of real outcomes that we are providing.</span>

                  </a>  I am happy to announce that when we arrived in government they had not signed up all of the states and territories, so we actually got the conditions in place for the concessional farm finance package, which they might have started but could never actually finish. We actually got those conditions in place so that we could start getting that money out. We actually approved $280 million to add to that, so we got $700 million of available finance. We actually changed the conditions of the farm household allowance so that we could have a higher net asset test so more people could actually get access to the money. We are happy with the fact that over 4,000 applications have been through and that you actually get the money until the department decides that you are not allowed to get the money. So you keep on getting the money until such time as, on the application being assessed, they decide you are not eligible for it. But it is not the case that you apply for the money and then you have to wait for your application to be approved. You actually get the money straightaway. So this is part of a process that is helping us look after the farmers that you left behind.</span>

It was a pleasure to be with him in his electorate last week for the beginning of another section of construction on the Pacific Highway. Another 23 kilometres will be duplicated as part of this projectâa part of our $5.6 billion commitment to upgrading the Pacific Highway. It is a road that has been identified by the NRMA and other motoring organisations as the most accident prone and dangerous in the state, and therefore it is appropriate that there should be a response of this natureâto four-lane the highway all the way to the Queensland border. That $5.64 billion that the coalition have put on the table is $3 billion more than what the opposition proposed in the pre-election fiscal outlook over the same period. Once more, Labor had such conditions attached to their money that even that amount was unlikely to have been provided. So this is a real part of building the roads of the 21st centuryâbuilding a link between our capital cities. It is four lanes and able to take the traffic volumes and the loads that are currently asking to use that kind of a network. It is not that road alone, of course; this national program involves substantial expenditure on projects like the Bruce Highway, the East West Link in Melbourne, the North-South Corridor in Adelaide, the Midland Highway in Tasmania, the Gateway WA project and the Swan Valley Bypass. All of those sorts of projects plus many others will transform our nation's infrastructure and make a real difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is about $11.6 billion also committed through our infrastructure growth package, which will help deliver new infrastructure funding on projects like WestConnex. WestConnex is expected to employ 10,000 people in the community. Those sorts of projects also make a real difference to our economy. But it is not just those major projects; there is also a commitment at the local level for local roads and streets through the Roads to Recovery Program, the Black Spot Program and the Bridges Renewal Program. This is a government that is committed to delivering on its promise to build the infrastructure of the 21st century and we are getting on with the job.</span>

It is a joint project, as the shadow minister says. We have committed 80 per cent of the funding and we are asking New South Wales to meet the other 20 per cent of the funding, which is consistent with the funding arrangements that apply to the national highway network. So New South Wales is partnering with us in this commitment to complete the Pacific Highway duplication by 2020. It is providing the funds that we have asked of it and we are getting on with the job, something Labor did not do when they slashed funding from these projects.</span>

The Black Spot Program and the road safety program for the heavy vehicle industry have got additional funding under this government, more than was provided by the previous government. The opposition simply cannot get away from the fact that they spent less on roads in their last year in government than the Howard government spent in its last year. The reality is they slashed road funding over their last year and it has taken this government to restore funding and increaseâ</span>

Given that these figures are factually based, when will the assistant minister admit that the money is already in the budget and his government still wants to cut the pay and conditions of Australian soldiers?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:45</span>):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question regarding the Parliamentary Budget Office reporting in terms of numbers. There is no question that the Parliamentary Budget Office looked at figures for uniformed military and for civilians. There is no question that those numbers increase year on year and, as stated previously, those increases cover 1,500 new soldiers, sailors and air men and women and over 1,000 new gap year participants and, of course, a 27th pay, which is a quarter of $1 billionâsmall money compared to the $16 billion, Leader of the Opposition, pulled out when the Labor government was last in power.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us talk about cuts, shall we, about what things have been cut and from where? I notice the member for Batman here, who was parliamentary secretary in the last Labor government. The parliamentary secretary wanted to take away the single return travel home for Christmas from 22,000 of our people. That is what the last Labor government cut. That was their Christmas present to our troopsâ'You can't get to go home.' That was stopped by this side. This side stopped Labor from cutting harshly in those areas. I find it extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition would walk in here and talk about cuts after $16 billion worth of cuts. Labor took defence spending to the lowest level since 1938âextraordinaryâdown to 1.56 per cent of GDP. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us talk about what this government has done. We have taken funding back to 1.8 per cent of GDP. We took a funding envelope to the last election with three things that the last Labor government could never do. Number one, there will be no cuts in Defence.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:49</span>):  I am really pleased to get this question from my good friend the member for Reid. What a great job he is doing. There is no wonder Labor is upset. There he is in what is traditional Labor heartland representing with great skill more than 19,000 small businesses which at last have an ally and an advocate for their community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of our job as the government is fixing the budget, getting the environmental conditions right for businesses large and small to thrive and prosper. We are implementing the economic action strategy and my friend the Minister for Industry has just outlined last week's crucial announcement, the Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda. It sets out for bold ambitions for our country, ambitions that are all about job creation and higher standards for our nation. They are about lowering the cost of doing business here in a more business-friendly environment, getting rid of those pointless and overreaching regulations, lower taxes and more competitive markets. They are about a more skilled workforce, better attuned to economic opportunities and the needs of our enterprises. They are about better economic infrastructure, the arteries of enterprise that are so important to building our capacity, and an industry policy that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that agenda, some very important announcements for small business were made. There was a key one about the taxation treatment of employee share schemes. This is needed to encourage start-ups, to enable them to attract and retain the employees they need to make their idea a business success, to commercialise those ideas and to create jobs and opportunities for our country. Nobody thought Labor had it right when in 2009 they shifted the taxing point from employee share options, not from when they were there, material and able to be exercised but when they were issued, a tax liability activated at the opportunity that there might be some benefit down the track. We have committed to turning that around, to getting that taxing point right so that employers and employees who want to work closely together to build their businesses can do so knowing that when the benefits arrive, when the shares are converted and those options become real, then the taxing point takes off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another initiative, something Labor could never do, was to provide some specific support for start-ups. Eligible start-up businesses will have an additional opportunity where shares and options are issued at a discount and held for more than three years. When they become taxed, that discount will be exempted up to 15 per cent and the tax on those options will be deferred until they are sold. This is about dealing with the legacy we have inherited from Labor, arresting the decline which saw 519,000 jobs lost under Labor. We are about re-energising enterprise and another instalment from the work of the Abbott coalition government to support small business, growth and opportunity in our economy.</span>

Minister, are there any threats to these savings? </span>

Along with the member for Hasluck, he was the co-architect of the Swan-Canning River Recovery Planâa million dollar planâpart of the coastal rivers recovery plan with the Tamar River, the Torrens River, the Yarra River and Tuggerah Lakes; real things to do to clean up our environment. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the member for Swan is not just a champion of the environment; he is also a champion of lower costs for families. The member for Swan voted to repeal the carbon tax; unlike his neighbour, the member for Perth, who voted to keep the carbon tax. The member for Swan voted for lower electricity prices; unlike the member for Perth who voted for higher electricity prices. </span>

He voted for a saving for Western Australian families on an average of 50 gigajoules of $80 a year; unlike the member Perth who, when she stops speaking, voted for higher gas prices and higher electricity prices. </span>

And, most recently, in the last few days the member for Swan voted for lower public transport costs, and just last week we saw Transperth announce fares would be reduced from November 1 following the repeal of the carbon tax. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He will not call it a carbon tax, but the answer is very simple: if it looks like a carbon tax, if it hurts like a carbon tax and if it raises electricity prices like a carbon tax, it is a carbon tax. You know what? He will not call it a carbon tax between now and the election, but we know what it is. You know what it is, and the Australian people know that you want to bring it back. We are for lower electricity prices; you are for higher electricity prices, and that is all that matters.</span>

                  </a>  In terms of the Treasurer, how badly was he misrepresented not just in terms of the interview but also from the member for Port Adelaide right now? There was no reference to per capita in the interview at the time. The question was about Australia, and what he was saying in terms of Australia was that, as one of the countries of the world, we represent 1.4 per cent of global emissions. What we see in representing that 1.4 per cent is that the United States, Germany, Japan and Canadaâall countries in the OECDâhave very significant emissions. Unlike many other countries, we are meeting our targets. We are actually achieving our targets. You may note that, of those that I mentioned, some of them are not. But you hear absolute silence from our friends on the other side, because the Treasurer's point is that, of the countries in the world that committed and signed up to targets, we met them. We didn't just meet them; we exceeded them. We passed them by 120 million tonnes and rising. We achieved our targets.</span>

But they want a reform that will allow more opportunity for Australians to go to university through Commonwealth scholarships and through the continuation of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme by expanding the Commonwealth Grant Scheme to non-university higher-education providers by extending the demand-driven system to associate degrees and diplomas. All of these measures will give more Australians the opportunity to go to university and will give our universities the chance to compete internationally with the best in the world, producing the best higher-education sector in the world and some of the highest-quality universities in the world. I urge the Senate, when it comes before it, to pass this important economic reform to transform the higher education sector.</span>

'Applications for grants for the 20 Million Trees Programme are now open for any interested group in the Port Adelaide electorate.' I am expecting him to be endorsing the Green Army, the coastal rivers programs, the dugongs and turtles program and our Antarctic program because, interestingly, he raises the question of the Antarctic. When we opened the bottom drawer it was very interesting, because they had talked about an ice breakerâa half a million-dollar program. And do you know what? There was nothing there. There was no money in the Antarctic program. </span>

They axed the solar rebate, the solar hot water rebate, but they could not fund the ice breaker. They did not fund the gateway partnership, they did not fund the Hobart runway programâwe did. At the end of the day, when it comes to the environment, we actually do the hard work. They are the frauds.</span>

Ebola is a very serious issue, particularly for West Africa, at the moment. We are seeing some horrific outcomes. The responsibility of many nations is to provide support, and Australia, as has always been the case, is providing humanitarian support to people on the ground. We provide $40 million a year to the WHO and we have provided $18 million to the WHO and NGOs on the ground who are engaging health workers to provide support to people who have contracted this very serious virus. Also important to the government is the months of preparation that we have put into the domestic response to deal with issues in our own region. It is the case, of course, that if there were an outbreak in Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands or elsewhere within our region there would be no expectation for health workers to come from Belgium or from France or Germanyâthe responsibility would rightly fall to Australia. And if we were asked by one of our partnersâone of our near neighboursâwe would respond accordingly. We have the capacity and the capability to do thatâto rapidly deploy forces out of Darwin into a near neighbour to provide that support. The government has, through the NSC, met on five separate occasions. We have taken advice from the chief of Defence, from the chief medical officer and from the head of Border Protection and Immigration, and we have a well-developed plan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to note that the Labor Party sought the same briefings, and the member for Sydney and the member for Ballarat and others were provided with these briefings and they were provided with information similar to that which the government was provided with, and yet, I can tell you, Madam Speaker, the most disappointing thing in this debate over the course of the last week has been the politicisation of this issue by the member for Sydney. Many people have recognised the difference in language, which is interesting to note, between the member for Sydney, who covets this position like crazy, and the language used by the Leader of the Opposition, which is in complete contrast to that which has been used by the member for Sydney. The member for Sydneyâwho has been a little more circumspect, I might say, in the last 48 hoursâneeds to be very careful in relation to this matter, because she might be liking the love that she is getting from the lefties behind her, but Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, is smart enough to realise that this is an issue that should be treated on a bipartisan basis. I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that the member for Sydney talking about sending Defence personnel and conscripting health workers to send them across to West Africa, when we do not have guarantees about medical support for those people in country, is nothing short of reckless, and the Labor Party sees a lot in the member for Sydney that they saw in Mark Lathamâeverything except the loyalty. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I can advise the House that the President and I made a decision on advice that was given to us that there was an action planned that would have disrupted the business of the House. We would have been derelict in our duty if we had not dealt with it. We made an interim ruling. We said that the question of face coverings was relevant because of the need to identify people who disrupt from the galleries, and there was no private space available to the entry to these galleries for face identification. So the interim ruling was made. Today we have issued a further ruling which now says that people entering with face coverings will be facially identified at the point of entry of the building, where there is a private space where people can be facially identified before coming in, and therefore the other ruling is not necessary, because they can simply then come through into the chamber.</span>

None of the other groups, to my knowledge, had a problem with facial recognition.</span>

As you know, my question related to segregation. On the evening of 2 October, the day of the announcement of the new policy for the public galleries, it was reported that the Prime Minister had asked you to reconsider the policy. However, the next day a journalist reported that your spokesman had said no request had been received from the Prime Minister to change this policy. Did you, Madam Speaker, receive a request from the Prime Minister to reconsider the policy?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014. I would like to commence by talking about a few points in this debate that have been raised by members of the opposition in which they continually talk about so-called 'spending cuts' to education. It seems to me that they have a policy that, if they continue to repeat this mantra with all their talking points about these so-called cuts, it will somehow become the truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than taking my word for it, let's look at what the facts actually are with these so-called cuts to educationâremembering that this is during a time when we are under significant budget pressure and for the last six years the government has spent on average more than 10 per cent more than they have actually raised in taxes. Against that background, the problem that we have with the debt, the ongoing obligation to pay the interest on the debt that Labor has run up and which now runs at $13.5 billion this year, the coalition government is still increasing education spending across the board by eight per cent this year, eight per cent next year and eight per cent the year after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, if we drill down to the figures in my home state of New South Wales, the figures for what we are doing in the education space are even more impressive. For this 2014-15 financial year, education spending from the Commonwealth to all New South Wales schools increases 6.7 per cent. Next financial year it is up a further 7.8 per cent. In 2016-17, on top of that is another increase, this time 9.4 per cent. In what would be the final year if this coalition government runs its three-year termâthe final budget this government would hand down, which would be the 2017-2018 budgetâit would be another 5.7 per cent increase. That amounts to $1.354 extra Commonwealth spending in New South Wales. That is a 33 per cent increase from 2013-14 to 2017-18.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When coming from a public school background the news is even better. In fact, from Labor's 2013-14 last budget to what would potentially be the coalition's last budget in 2017-18, federal government spending to New South Wales public schools will increase 49.6 per cent. I say that again to dispel some of the myths about how we are cutting education. Spending under this government will be 49.6 per cent higher in our last budget than the last budget of the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we still have all this discussion about cuts and cuts and cuts. Perhaps the last word on these so-called cuts belongs to ABC Fact Check. We know the ABC always gets it right, so I am very happy to quote from them. This is what they had to say about these so-called cuts:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The verdict: The Government did not cut $30 billion from schools in the May budget. The $30 billion figureâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">is calculated over a 10 year period starting in 2017. It adds up the difference between the increase in funding that Labor says it would have delivered and the increase the Government may deliver. There is too much uncertainty for such a long-term estimate to be reliable measure of either cuts or savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about cuts or increases that Labor may deliver, we know that pigs may fly, because they have simply no idea where this money is coming from. I am very proud to be part of a coalition government that is delivering such substantial increases to New South Wales schools, especially New South Wales public schools, which will see almost a 50 per cent increase in their funding from the federal government. That is even more impressive during such times of difficult budget arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the specifics of the bill, the first purpose of the Australian Education Amendment Bill is to amend the Australia Education Act 2013 to allow payment of additional funding in 2014 to schools with large numbers of Indigenous boarding students from a remote areas to meet an identified resourcing shortfall. The Indigenous boarding initiative announced in the 2014-15 budget will provide a further $6.8 million to eligible schools and regulations will determine school eligibility and amounts of the funding initiative. Yet another $6.8 million going into education funding.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, this bill will provide funding cuts to students with disabilities and other students in some independent special schools and assistance schools to actually prevent those cuts that would otherwise occur from 1 January 2015 by ensuring transitional funding arrangements for these schools that are consistent with other schools under the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill makes a number of minor corrections to errors and omissions that occurred during the original preparation of the act prepared by Labor and which undermine the intended operation of the act and correct funding and regulatoryâ</span>

                    </a>  That is right, fix uncertainty for schools. These amendments will ensure, amongst other things, the correct calculation of Commonwealth government entitlements for all schools. The financial impact of this is $6.8 million in additional funding for eligible non-government schools in 2014-15 under the Indigenous boarding initiative and an additional $2.4 million for special independent schools.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not only money that goes into education; what is also very important is what is taught in our schools. That is why I congratulate the education minister for his review of what was in our national curriculum. We had those cross-curriculum priorities embedded across all areas of the curriculum. They were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture, Asia and Australia's engagement in Asia, and, of course, sustainability. While they may all be very important in their own respect, embedding them across every area of the curriculum can only cause enormous problems.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it could be very good that this is going to. But I think there is potential in mathematics, especially when it comes to economic sustainability.

                    </a>  That is absolutely right: it is a year 11 and year 12 course. This is one way that we could assist our children in mathematics. We could also assist them with the mathematical concept of simple interest. We could take Labor's debt and we could get our students to work out what the annual interest repayments would be. The answer at the moment is $13.5 billion. We could take that further, since economic sustainability is embedded in our curriculum, and on to the concept of division. Yes, our interest payments are $13.5 billion a year, but how much would it be a month? That could be a question for our students. That would work out at $1.125 billion. We could get them to further divide that. How much a week? Our interest payments currently are $260 million every single week. That is how much this nation must find. What about a day? It is $37 million. Or an hour? It is $1.5 million. In fact, in the 15 minutes that we are allocated here as our speaking time on each bill, the interest repayments that this nation must pay on its debt is $375,000. In the 15 minutes I will speak on this bill this nation will have to raise $375,000. That is just the interest on Labor's debt. The scary thing is that we have to do that foreverâevery 15 minutes of the day, every day of the week, every week of the month, every month of the year forever until we start paying back the principal debt. What is even worse is that 75 per cent of that has to go overseas.</span>

We know that there was one that they fluked about 25 years ago when the member for Longman he was not even born. They fluked one 25 years ago. So, maybe in the next 50 years there is a very good chance that lighting might strike twice and we may actually have a Labor government delivering a second budget surplus in 50 years.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  The previous speaker, the member for Hughes, made mention of the fact that he wanted Australian students to take part in some sort of pop quiz to test their mathematical abilities; their abilities to create sums and test their addition skills. I am very interested in the quiz that the previous speaker proposes because in my view I think those students should turn their attention to the actual cuts that have been made to their educationâcuts that have been made to their schools; cuts that have been made to their primary schools, cuts that have been made to their high schoolsâby the Abbott government. It is my view that the attention of young Australians' mathematical skills should be focused on looking at the billions of dollars worth of cuts that are going to take place to Gonski as a result of this government, focused on the impact of the billions of dollars of cuts to Gonski and the impact of that. Essentially, what that means is that 20,000 teachers will potentially lose their jobs, will not get their jobs funded. Why don't young Australians turn their attention to those sorts of figures? Billions of dollars worth of cuts as a result of the cuts to Gonski during the last two years, and the impact that will have on them. The figures I have seen show that potentially 20,000 teachers will not be employed. We could also get the students of Australia to turn their attention to the impact of the cuts to the schoolkids bonus and, most importantly, the impacts of the cuts on trade training centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here again we are talking about nearly $1 billion of investment in trade training centres goneânot just here in Canberra but right across the nation. We have a suite of trade training centres here in my electorate, in Tuggeranong in the south of Canberra, and we have our sustainable learning centre down in Tuggeranong where a number of colleges and the high schools have got trade training centres. Those opposite have condemned the whole trade training centre notion; those opposite have abolished future funding for the trade training centres. I find it galling when members of the coalition government, when members of the Abbott government, come along and open these centres and talk about the importance of trade training, the importance of developing pathways between high school and a vocational education, the importance of providing options to studentsâoptions where students can actually go and get a degree in carpentry or a cert IV in hospitality or a cert IV in mechanics while, at the same time, continuing with their year 12 and continuing with their English and their French and gaining a breadth of experience and knowledge that trade training centres provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it particularly galling when those members oppositeâI am sure they have been running around opening trade training centres. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the minister at the table, is smiling: how many trade training centres have you opened since the election last year, Parliamentary Secretary? How many trade training centres? And what have you said? 'Gee, these trade training centres are fantastic. These trade training centres provide great pathways for young Australians; they provide pathways and give options to people who may not necessarily be suited for university. These are great things, these trade training centres.' And yet, with their next breath, they say, 'The future funding for these trade training centres has been abolished.' It has been breathtaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also suggest that young Australians turn their attention to the fact that the secular chaplaincy scheme is being scrapped. Just think about the impact that is going to have on the mental health and wellbeing of young Australians in a range of schools throughout Australia. So rather than taking the previous speaker's arithmetic pop quiz, I suggest that young Australians take this pop quiz and look at the impact of not having those last two years of funding for Gonski, nearly $3 billions worth of funding; look at the impact of the potential loss of 20,000 teachers out of the system; and look at the impact of the loss of the schoolkids bonus on low- and middle-income families. Low- and middle-income families no longer get the opportunity to have the schoolkids bonus; it provided them with a chance to go out and get computers, school shoes, uniforms. It encouraged people to stay in education; it was a great scheme, a great bonus. It is gone as a result of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But most importantly there is the impact as a result of cuts in funding to the trade training centres. What is the future cost to young Australians who have had that door closed to them?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M2Y" type="MemberInterjecting">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Tudge:</span>
                    </a>  Is this relevant?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30540" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms BRODTMANN:</span>
                    </a>  It is relevant. I am just taking up the suggestion of the previous speaker; I am countering his quiz with my quiz, which I think goes into far more depth about the true impact of your cuts on the future of our education system. As a result of the $1 billion cuts to the trade trading centres, a number of pathways are completely shut off for young Australians throughout the country in addition to secular chaplaincies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill, the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014. I am pleased that I have got the opportunity because it gives me the chance to voice the concerns of millions of schoolchildren and their parents, as well as tens of thousands of teachers throughout the country who will be worse off under this government. Overall this legislation represents another example of the Abbott government's betrayal when it comes to education. It is yet another example of the government walking away from Gonski. The Gonski reforms were the most comprehensive reforms to be introduced in 40 years. They came after years of lobbying, years of advocacy, years of consultation, years of research by those in the education sector. They had the support of teachers; they had the support of principals; they had the support of parents, of students, of the states and territories; and they were supported by the Catholic sector, the independent sector and the public sector. As a result of those years of consultation with a range of individualsâof actually going out to schools and consulting with the teachers, the staff, the students and their parents at the schools in my electorateâI know that the Gonski reforms had very strong support among the people of Canberra, which is why I am a passionate believer in those reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the legislation: the first part of this legislation will provide support for Indigenous students in boarding schools. The government has announced this will facilitate payments of about $6.8 million in support to boarding schools in the 2014-15 financial year. At this stage, the funding has not been provided beyond that period. We on this side of the House believe in helping students from remote communities access boarding-school education, which is why we allocated extra money to every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student in every school. We will rally behind any move that will help close the gap in school education. That is why we strongly support this measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of this bill ensures continued funding for independent special schools and we are pleased to see that independent special schools will be no worse off next year. However, we would not be debating this measure if the government had kept its promise on Gonski; I referred to that in the earlier part of my speech. I am particularly talking here about the Gonski element of the disability loading and the extra funding which comes from that. We funded the $100 million per year More Support for Students with Disabilities program to ensure that funding was allocated to students who needed it most, while work continued to finalise the full Gonski disability loading in 2015. In this year's budget the government cut that program and failed to replace it with the promised additional funds. In our view, the Abbott government is again failing students with a disability by reneging on a pre-election promise to increase funding from next year. I quote the words of the now education minister, prior to the election:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If elected to government the coalition will continue the data collection work that has commenced, which will be used to deliver more funding for people with disability through the 'disability loading' in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those opposite I say: this is the worst type of promise to break. These people need this funding and they need this support, and you have let them down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from breaking a funding promise when it comes to the finalisation of the Gonski disability loading, stakeholders say the government has rushed the consultation process and that, where consultation has occurred, it has been incredibly secretive. The bottom line here is that students with a disability will have $100 million in support cut next year and we on this side of the HouseâLaborâwill continue to fight to provide support to the students who need this funding the most. Labor will not stand in the way of measures in this bill, but promises that were made to students with a disability have been broken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the next aspect of this bill which I wholeheartedly oppose, and that is the delay to the implementation of the school improvement plan by one year. This plan is about ensuring that the money invested in schools by the federal government actually reaches the classrooms. It is a vital part of the reforms and of our school system. Accountability is central to the Gonski reforms. Funding should be needs based and it should be driven by improvements in the classroom. We outlined a school development plan for every school; they were developed in consultation with the school community and designed to help improve school results. This part of the bill facilitates further changes to the improvement plan, but we have significant concerns with what is proposed in this element.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am conscious of the time but I just want to make a few other comments. I am very concerned about what this government has planned for primary education, and education more generally, for the people of Australia. I am particularly concerned because when I go out to parts of my electorate, I am exposed to students in need. People tend to think that Canberra is an incredibly well-off community, and we are in many ways; but there are significant pockets of disadvantage and I have made that clear in many of my speeches in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly see these areas of disadvantage and these students in need through a program I have implemented called the School Legends program. Last year I was going around awarding some of the School Legends awards towards the end of the year, either at presentations or by going to schools on the last day of school. I noticed, and was greatly concerned by, some significantly disadvantaged students. One who really sticks in my mind was a young Indigenous boy who had overcome significant adversity over the course of last year; he was well and truly deserving of the School Legends award. This young boy was in year 1. He turned up at the beginning of school and could not talk. He had been through a very, very difficult time at home. He was not terribly well nourished. He was taking part in the school's breakfast program and their after-school care program so he could get fed before he went home. His uniform was in a pretty bad state; his shoes were falling apart. In a way, he epitomised to me an extraordinary individual who had overcome significant adversity. He also epitomised those elements of disadvantage both in the Canberra community and throughout the country, and how we need to reach out and help those disadvantaged. The reforms that Labor introduced with Gonski targeted disadvantaged students, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, Indigenous students, students in remote areas and students who do not have English as a first language. They targeted those areas of disadvantage. That was what I most admired. I was so proud of the Gonski program. I admired it the most; my community admired it the most. They could see that through targeted funding at people experiencing disadvantage we could give them help, a hand up, and that through education we could transform their lives. This is why I condemn those opposite for discontinuing the last two years of funding for Gonski. It is designed to target the disadvantaged, to assist them and to give them a leg up to break the cycle of disadvantage.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="96430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EWEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014. I like the member for Canberra and I think she is a good person, but can we all, please, stop talking about Gonski as though the Labor Party implemented what Gonski said. Labor implemented what they thought they could get away with. They did not implement GonskiâGonski cost way more money than thatâthat was just their version. It is like the NDIS. They do not deliver what is recommended. The education funding that we agreed to was not Gonski; it was what Labor took to the last election. They can backhand it as much as they want and I will come back to those points later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Education Act 2013 is the principal legislation by which the Australian government provides financial assistance to approved authorities for government and non-government schools. This bill amends the Australian Education Act 2013 to allow payment of additional funds in 2014 to schools with large numbers of Indigenous boarding students from remote areas. The Indigenous Boarding Initiative was announced as part of the 2014-15 budget and it provides approximately $6.8 million of additional funding to eligible schools. This bill will prevent funding cuts that would have occurred on 1 January 2015 to students with disabilities and other students in some independent schools and special assistance schools. These changes will result in an additional $2.4 million being paid to these schools in this financial year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also addresses other errors and omissions that occurred during the preparation of the act. One of those amendments will ensure the correct calculation of Commonwealth funding entitlements for all Australian schools. I will detail some of these later on in the speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments put in place by the previous government mean that some independent schools and special assistance schools will have their funding reduced from 1 January 2015. This cannot be a good thing. We must provide certainty for these schools, their students and the families who send their children away to get a first-class education. The Australian government funding for schools is provided to state and territory governments, and the funds are then distributed to the schools in line with the act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014, around $14 billion will be paid to government and non-government schools. The bill's regulations will contain the type of information that the minister must have regard to in exercising the new terms of eligibility and calculation of the funding, and be subject to review and disallowance by the parliament. We must enable payment of the Australian government's Indigenous Boarding Initiative. The initiative will provide interim support for non-government schools with more than 50 Indigenous boarding students from remote or very remote areas or where 50 per cent or more of their boarding students are Indigenous and from remote or very remote areas. This additional funding will assist non-government boarding schools to provide students with high-quality education for Indigenous students. This bill will also ensure that certain schools or special assistance schools will not have their funding reduced in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current safety net that is in place will disappear and that would mean that funding for these schools would be immediately reduced from 1 January 2015. This is because the current work with the states and territories to develop national data has not been completed. This amending legislation will not only protect funding for these schools but also ensure that these schools transition to the schooling resource standard in a manner consistent with other schools until the revised student-with-disability loadings are available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people across the sector, from state and territory governments to the non-government school sector, who believe that the Commonwealth has overreached its role into the daily running of schools. If we are to have a quality outcome, all stakeholders must be on the same pageâas much as we can all be on the same page when it comes to education between state and territory and federal governments. We will continue to consult so that we can provide certainty for schools. We need a proper command-and-control requirement structure under the act so that any changes are handled well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amending legislation will also allow the minister to take action, if required, under this act where a school has failed to comply with requirements under the former Schools Assistance Act 2008. This will provide greater flexibility by allowing the noncompliance to be managed by delaying future payments as opposed to requiring a debt to be raised under the former legislation. If this is to work properly we need to be expeditious on all sides to get the best possible outcome. We are not talking about a building infringement here; we are talking about the lives of students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also corrects errors in the formula that is used to determine funding entitlements by the Schooling Resource Standard. This will mean that the Commonwealth will pay only its share of the funding entitlement, whereas previously the federal government could pay the entire Commonwealth and state share of the entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 26 February 2014 in this place I made my contribution in response to the Prime Minister's statement on Closing the Gap. I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a belief in my community that there is enough money in the system for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, that there is enough money in the system to house them and that there is enough money for the education of their children but it is just that it does not get through to the people who need it the most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand by those words. If this country is going to move from a hand-out to a hand-up then it must start early, at a time when our Indigenous population is at school. The Prime Minister stated that education is the key. In his speech he said, 'We need full participation in education in modern Australia.' There would never have been a truer word spoken in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also add a little bit about Minister Pyne's direct instruction funding, as I do feel that it fits with this bill like a hand into a glove. The $40 million he announced in Townsville for remote education is a great start. What he has recognised is that people learn differently. People from remote areas start their formal learning experiences at different ages, meaning that, problematically, you can have multiple problems in achieving the square peg in the square hole objective of our primary schools and that is a serious challenge. Direct instruction does not recognise the age of the student nor the grade in which they are supposed to be. It only looks at how we can get the student to learn at their level and improve. We need to get that straight from the start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, we seem to entice children of all ethnicities to school with the prospect of an engaged learning experience. We promise sport, music, art and drama. But when we get them there, even in prep, we tie them to a desk and suck the life out of them. Music and art are fantastic ways to engage students and get them to understand learning. Indigenous students born in remote Australia stagger their entry into our schools system. We have to understand that they do not do things the same way that we, non-Indigenous, city based Australians, do, and have different expectations and experiences. That is why we need to understand that it takes more money to get many of our Indigenous students to a level where they can understand the need for education and the joy of learning. I do not speak down to anyone, but there is a gap in education and that leads to poorer life outcomes. If we are truly to close the gap, we just have to get this right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was first a candidate in 2010, I struggled with what was more importantâhealth or education. It quickly dawned on me that, when dealing with disadvantage and poverty, education is the key to better opportunities, better options, better life choices, better diet, better health and more self-respect. I truly believe that there are a large number of Aboriginal and Islander young people out there yearning for this. The message must be delivered by them. It is pointless for someone like me going out to tell them that their diet is wrong. It must be delivered by the men and women who have made their choices and stuck to the path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I often speak about Matthew Bowen, the mercurial fullback for the North Queensland Cowboys. His is from Hope Vale in the north of our state. His parents knew that if they wanted an outcome for him he had to go to school. He is what we need to show kids what is possible no matter where you live. He boarded at Abergowrie College outside Ingham. He joined the Cowboys, and on his first away trip he was handed a beer after his debut. He took a swallow and he said, 'I do not know how you drink that stuff.' His life choices centred on his wellbeing. He had a family which reinforced those values. My wife is a preschool teacher and I often speak to her about the benefits of using Matthew Bowen as the role model for Indigenous children. My wife says the real role model is Matthew's mum. While Matthew could go out and play with the kids and tell them about his journey and what it is like playing for the Cowboys, Queensland and Australia, and what he had to eat, his discipline and what he had to do, his mum should be sitting down and speaking to all of the other mums about how she did it for Matthew, because that is the real role model. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, with education we have to understand that we cannot fix everything by just funding boarding schoolsâor having a footballer tell kids about how they did it. We have to be engaged with not only the successful people who come through the system but also their network who gave them the opportunity, who set their values and instilled their work ethic. Those people, many of whom would not have had the opportunity to get a great educational opportunity afforded their children, are the major part of the puzzle that we need to harness. For me and my family, education is a natural right. My three children have been bought up in a house which values educational opportunity. Not only that, we fully understand and we expect that it is our right to demand such a thing. We have to make that a rightâan expectationâfor all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is committed to supporting the delivery of quality education and quality schooling, and providing funding and regulatory certainty for all Australian schools. I am certain every person in this place wants exactly that. Minister Pyne said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Government is committed to making sure every Australian child has the opportunity to reach their potential through a great education, thatâs why weâre investing a record $64.5 billion in schools over the next four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also recognised that people learn differently, and he is funding those programs. This government is also committed to ensuring that the country's Indigenous students living in remote locations across this country get the support they need to face the challenges of obtaining a quality education. Every dollar we put into improving Indigenous education is a dollar well spent and will be returned to our economy in the long term if it is used correctly. I will warn, however, that investment in funds must be matched with investment in activity and investment in the drive for better outcomes. That is what this government wants. It is pointless to brag about the quantum of funding if we do not drive the outcomes of the students with as much passion. The key to this is that this place, and everyone in it, wants better outcomes for every student. We must drive the results, as the Prime Minister says, by demanding full participation in education in modern Australia. We must be driving the outcomes just as hard as we are driving participation. To do that, we have to get our starting pointâour foundationsâright. Nothing is more important than that, and that must be the motivation for all in the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have time, I want to address some of the things that some speakers opposite have been talking about. They have been saying that they had funded the Gonski model past the forward estimates. There is a big difference between making an announcement and paying for it. Anyone can make an announcement, but it is the funding of it that you have to deliver. That is the key. Anyone can make an announcement. We could just stand there and say, 'Sixty-eight billion dollars,' or, 'Another hundred thousand trillion dollars.' But if you do not back it up with how you are actually going to fund it, then it is not worth the paper it is written on. The last government was just so terrible at following through with this. What they delivered was not Gonski; what they delivered was not the NDIS; what they delivered was their version of itâthe thing they thought they could get away with. They did not deliver it. They did not fund it and they back-ended it so that it was outside the forward estimates, so they did not have to be accountable for it. Going into the last election, we said that we would commit to funding for the next four yearsâthat we would commit to Labor's plan for next four years. In fact, when we came in we actually put back in the $1.2 billion that Labor pulled out in the PYEFO. My state of Queensland is the major beneficiary of that to the tune of $958 million. So, please, I know it looks good on everyone's things to put out to your electorates, and to send it around and to be good and all of that sort of stuff , saying, 'This is what we are sticking to; this is why the Liberal government is no good and why the coalition is bad.' But you have to back it up with something; you have to have a plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had some school kids up in the gallery before. They are at school now but they will be paying for this when they start work. It is the same as the schoolkids bonus. You funded it out of the minerals resource taxâthe mining super profits tax. It did not raise any money, but you committed the funds. And you do not have to spend it on education; you just give to someone the cash. If they want to spend it at the local pub or if they want to go to the bottle-o, they can do that. What we used to do, and what there used to be by everyone on both sides of parliament, was we had to produce receipts that said it went to education. When you did that you got your money back on your tax. What we do now is just a splash for cash, because the only constituency Labor has left are those people willing to take cash for no other reason. I am really disappointed with some of the words coming from those opposite because I would have thought that education was a bit more important than that. I stand by this amendment; I stand by making the thing work. I thank the House.</span>

This Australian Education Amendment Bill is making changes at the edges of current legislation, changes that are acceptable and necessary when you are working at the edges without a view to deep reform. In fact, most bills introduced into the parliament during my time here have been amendment billsânot new nor progressive, innovative and forward-looking pieces of legislation but amendment bills; bills that either implement cuts, tinker at the edges like this one and delay programs, rather than drive the reform needed to improve educational outcomes for students across our diverse communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has three componentsâall of which, under the circumstances, I and Labor support. First, the bill establishes a mechanism to allow the minister to make payments to schools for a reason prescribed by regulation. The government has announced that this will facilitate the payment of around $6.8 million in support to boarding schools in 2014-15. This will assist schools with more than 50 Indigenous boarders from remote communities or where more than 50 per cent of boarders are Indigenous and come from remote communities. We, of course, support this measure. We know that this is just one of many steps that the government must take to close the gap in school education for Indigenous children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also changes the funding transition rules for independent special schools so that their funding is not worse off from next year. Finally, it seeks to delay by at least a year the implementation of school improvement plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments we debate today to ensure funding for Indigenous students and students with a disability would not be necessary if the findings of the Gonski review were being implemented as promised by this government. This government inherited a national agenda, an expectant school sector. The work had been done. There was consensus. The country was reform ready. Â Â Â All sectors were on board. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The detailed research and consultation processes across the country that created the much-needed reforms that would ensure equity across our schools through the student loadings were delivered by Labor. In it were six additional funding loadings: one for small schools, Â Â Â one for remote schools, one for Indigenous students, one for students with low English, one for students from disadvantaged backgrounds and, importantly, one for students with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this bill is such a disappointment. It highlights this government's failure to deliver on the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity the Gonski review represented. What this bill highlights is that the expectation and readiness for a national approach to education is being unpicked one layer at a time. And in doing so, this government and this minister are breaking solemn promises made before the election to all school sectors and all states. Minister Pyne said, 'You can vote Labor or Liberal and you'll get exactly the same funding for your school dollar for dollar.' The Prime Minister said he was on a unity ticket on school funding. Now, the Minister for Education suggests that education is not the federal government's business, that the SES model was working well. Despite the review finding that more investment was needed, the minister said that 'schools are awash with money'. Clearly, what the Gonski review found was that it was not serving this country and our students well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the federal government's business because we cannot improve learning and outcomes across the country with a piecemeal, often ill-informed and a state-by-state, sector-by-sector funding approach. The case of the students with disability highlights why we need a national approach. Definitions of the disabilities that attract extra support vary significantly across the different states and territories, and so does the average level of support which is delivered in those jurisdictions. There are ranges from $4,000 to $40,000 per student. The Gonski review highlighted this and the previous government acknowledged that further work needed to be done before this could be addressed nationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor funded the More Support for Students with Disabilities program to the tune of $100 million a year to make sure that those students who need the most assistance got the assistance that they needed, and to allow time for data collection and further collaboration with the states and school systems on disability funding to ensure that the final loading would give students the resources they needed with the planned implementation of the loading for 2015. Now, this bill confirms that this will not happen and we are rushing through an amendment to make up for the fact that the work has not been done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The variations reflected across the states and between the sectors in the disability area are similarly reflected in other areas of resourcing. Victoria is a case in point. It has long used a needs-based funding model while other states did not, nor did the private sector. Victoria decentralised and enshrined school autonomy over 15 years ago while other states did not. The state-by-state difference is the reason we need a national approach to improve student outcomes in every school in this country. This government was left with not just the findings of the review but plans for implementation, and sector and state agreements in principle. The hard work had been done. The research supported the need and provided many of the answers, beginning with a model that focused on student need and provided the resources at the school level to minimise inequity and drive improvement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us for debate today highlights this government's and this minister's lack of understanding. He should be embarrassed to bring this bill before us. If he understood the urgency on the ground, if he understood the link between education and endeavour, between a skilled community and an innovative future, and between equity and outcomes, he would be embarrassed. But I fear he does not understand these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria, indeed probably in most states, school improvement plans have been a feature for years. A positive outcome of the Gonski funding review was to ensure that school improvement plans were a feature in all schools. Schools take their role seriously and welcome the ability to show improvementâthe schools I know in Victoria do. They love to show how additional funding has been utilised, to reflect and review current practice and to plan next steps. That is what a school improvement plan delivers. Putting off school improvements plans for another 12 months just stalls our progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not innovate; it seeks to delay the introduction of school improvement plans. What could more markedly demonstrate this government's lack of passion when it comes to school improvement? I cannot remember a time when we had a less interested education minister. Where are the major education speeches by this minister? Where do you see him seriously engaging with teachers, principals, parents, carers or indeed school children? When do you see him meeting with international experts or key education researchers? Where is his vision for the future of our students? I would accept a minister driving education change based on strong-held beliefs, based on quality research and deep discussion with the industry. However, I regard this tinkering at the edges approach as an insult to the educators and it must be a real disappointment to parents. Those I feel most for are the students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's record to date is poor. Indeed, as a former teacher I would probably mark himâunlike the Prime Ministerâwith an 'F' for fail. His report home would read, 'Must try harder and stop obstructing the class. We assume he is bright; he talks all the time!' Minister Pyne's record to date has been to cut the fifth and sixth year of the Gonski funding; to cut $80 million from schools and hospitals over the next decade in partnership with the Minister for Health; to lock school funding increases to CPI from 2018, meaning that instead of a 5.1 per cent increase per annum it will drop to 2.5 per cent; and he has reverted to throwing crumbs in program plans for schools to scurry after, rather than delivering the nationwide promise that was Gonski.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I hear on the ground from my former education colleagues in Victoria paints a very depressing picture. When I ask principals about their budgets for next year I hear about a lack of transparency. I hear that there is no acknowledgement of an increase in funding, that there is no evidence of the loading based model that was supposed to be in place. Premier Napthine and Victorian Education Minister Dixon seem to be deliberately keeping schools in the dark. Funding allocations for next year are presented in an obscure and confusing way, making it very difficult for schools to determine if they are receiving the Gonski money as promised. <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> reported on the weekend Minister Pyne saying that 'Commonwealth funding for the 2014 to 2017 funding period it is settled', while Victorian officials claim they cannot release details under FOl because 'they relate to ongoing negotiations between the Commonwealth and Victoria'. I worked in education for a long time. I have seen a lot of federal and state ministers for education come and go but I have never seen an education minister shy about spruiking funding. It is usually done with great fanfare and bold number headlines. That is not what is happening in Victoria with Minister Dixon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion I will support this amendment bill because I would not see a student in this country go unsupported. I would conclude, however, with a final observation. This amendment bill is indicative of this minister's agenda to wind back the Gonski reforms, to prevent the equity-driven reform he inherited. This minister seeks to break the cross-sectoral consensus on a fairer and more effective way to fund schoolsâa consensus hard won and hard fought, unknown in this country, where all sectors are united behind improving our schools and the way to do that. He seeks to wind back the clock to the Howard years of dissent and argument. I offer, as a case in point, the latest review of the curriculum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say as a former teacher in this place that this obsession with politicians about the what of curriculum over the how is breathtaking. An article this week in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span> by Misty Adoniou is at pains to explain how teachers plan and how to tear the national curriculum apart, to put content on one side and then say that general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities should be cut because the curriculum is cluttered is a complete misunderstanding of the way classrooms operate and the way teachers, as professionals, pan for education. I recommend that those in this House read this work. We did not need a review of the national curriculum; we needed the national curriculum to be worked on in classrooms and to have professionals give feedback on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a previous educator, this minister has disappointed me in that he seeks to perpetuate privilege and to undermine equity and improvement. I would in this place use this opportunity to call on those concerned with education, on those who work in any of the sectors across our country to resist the temptation to divide and fight over the crumbs being offered to us by this government and to continue to speak with one voice to continue to demand what was promised.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  There can be few more important topics for us to be debating in this great chamber than the quality of education and schools in this country. I welcome the opportunity and, while this bill addresses some relatively minor measures, it is an opportunity to review what has been achieved by the coalition over the last 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the previous speaker with her extensive experience presenting her point of view to the chamber, although I was a little disappointed: I would have liked a little more detail regarding her concerns around curriculum review. It would have been a good opportunity to elaborate on her skills and background in this chamber but, unfortunately, that was not the case. What I did manage to divine from her comments was that she did not support a review of the curriculum thinking that it wasn't required; a sense that it is really all about the how, not about the whatâwhich I think most people would probably disagree with; and, finally, a very, very veiled criticism of the current education minister saying that he was in some way not devoted to the taskâa comment that even some of his most virulent opponents would probably struggle to sustain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's debate is about Indigenous boarding initiatives and making sure that schools, mostly non-government schools that take large numbers of Indigenous students, are appropriately compensated through the system; and, secondly, to look after the special schools and special assistance schools that, without these amendments today, are faced with a potential fall in their funding in 2015. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those two relatively minor elements of the overall education picture open a door to examine how we are performing in Indigenous education in general. I made the observation two years ago with the ABS population data of indigeneity that we were in many cases failing to tease out two cohorts within Indigenous Australia's population: the first, the predominantly urban Indigenous Australians who are living surrounded in many cases by opportunity but are unable to access it and that represents about two-thirds of Australia's Indigenous population; and then the 100,000âor even moreâIndigenous Australians living remotely. They have completely different outcomes. They follow a completely different life course, and it would be wrong for authorities, entities, departments and those of us in here to average the two and talk about improvements in Aboriginal outcomes. I can guarantee that is not the case in remote Australia. When we come forward today with legislation, our job is to ensure that it supports those remote families just as much as it does those who choose to live in the regions or cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us talk about some specifics: if you go and visit an East Arnhem community of 1,000 people today, you will find that fewer than five per cent of children finishing school go on to find a jobâfive per cent. If you visit an average Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory, just 15 per cent of the community have a job. All of those jobs, bar none, are public sector jobs funded by the taxpayer. I have made this observation before: we have created a remote Australia utterly devoid of a private sector, and this is the only place in the world where that is the case. Through our systems we have created the virtual absence of a service economy, bar publicly funded services that are dropped onto or into communitiesâthat is right: there is virtually no inter-Aboriginal service economy. There is no payment for services, so in a context of goods and services where there are no services all you can do with your money is purchase goods. That is at the heart of the dysfunction that we see when we visit: imported rubbish, food and a few other items that are trucked in are pretty much the only things one can spend money on. Until we have a more developed system of opportunity in communities, there will not be much connection through the education system to drive ambition and connectedness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought Noel Pearson put it so well when he said: 'We have a future where we can walk in two worlds as Aboriginal Australians: the Aboriginal world and the mainstream.' In fact, when you think about it, Aboriginal Australians have a pre-eminent place, because they can walk in two worlds, unlike mainstream Australians who cannot. So there is the challenge: that young Aboriginal Australians can aspire to succeed in both worlds. The Pearson argument of course is that the best way to succeed in both of those worlds is to be literate, healthy with a functional family structure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would add to that: there is no need to be tied and anchored to land in order to love it. As long as you can be the custodian of that land for some part in your life journey, it involves leaving. This is the element of the Indigenous boarding school initiative. The realisation that, just like people all over the world who do not live in major tertiary centres, at some time you need to leave your small town to fill your life, gain an education, an experience, in order to return it to the community where you were born. That makes complete sense to the rest of the world but, no, no, no, here in remote Australia, mainstream Australia has decided that that is not what Aboriginal Australians want. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You need to talk to families. Of course they want to make sure that they are close to their loved ones. They want to be close to seniors in the final years of their lives, like everyone. They want to know that, if there are cultural obligations, they can get back to their communities. But, beyond that, they are just like everyone else in the world: loving of their family and looking for opportunity for their young ones. They are no different to anyone else, so let's work about creating the opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said one thing very clearly and for a very long time: the greatest human rights violation in this country is not sending your children to school. As long as we have roughly 50 per cent of Aboriginal Australians going to school, we have a massive problem. That is not to say that quality is not important, but a child not turning up to school is getting zero per cent quality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have those little kids sitting in seats in order to drive the political obligation to educate them well. Where those children do not go to school, you can understand a state or territory government saying, 'There're only 20 kids in that class, not 40. We'll only give them one teacher, not two,' and the funding is withdrawn because the children are not in the classroom. Attendance is everything, and I am delighted the coalition government is 100 per cent focused on that task. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at education reform, we have acknowledged teacher quality, principal autonomy, parental engagement and the quality of the curriculum. I think the work by Kevin Donnelly and Ken Wiltshire in not ripping it up and starting againâno, looking at the curriculum that was an honest piece of work by the previous governmentâbut simply saying: 'There can be some modest but significant changes to make it even better' was almost universally applauded by both sides of that ideological spectrum. They need to be congratulated and not talked down as they were by the previous speaker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Donnelly and Wiltshire, thank you: you made the obvious observation that sustainability and Indigenous Australia are vital parts of our curriculum but it should not be automatically and mandatorily woven into everything we do. In some cases, Aboriginal history and sustainability are not relevant areas to that part of the curriculum. It belongs where it belongs and it should not be forced where it does not. It is such a commonsense recommendation and, among hundreds of pages of those great suggestions, virtually all of them have been generally agreed to by both sides of a very wide ideological spectrumâfrom the left and the intense views about collectivism right through to these who are insisting on individualism and a free market. Well done to both of those gentlemen, who achieved such a breathtaking outcome in the education space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a minister who is fiercely engaged in education. I make the simple point that we will be measured for our time in this chamber today and this electoral term on how we go with Indigenous Australia. We will be harshly judged if, as occurred with the previous government, we leave the place pretty much unchanged from how we found it. That is what happened in Indigenous education over the last six years of the Labor government. Let me answer why that was the case. What we had, of course, was a fear of the remote. We had a real sense that most political power being centred in cities was where most of the Labor attention was focused. It was very hard to get Labor focus out to remote areas and remote education. The evidence I put to you is the attendance rate at school, which flatlined. There was no change in six years. I can guarantee you one thing: that will not be the case under a coalition government. You will see an increase in school attendanceâbecause, as long as kids are not at school, they lose that connectedness to the real economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those two key areas at either end of your school experienceâthe zero to five-year issue of getting kids ready, capable, fed, dressed and able to emotionally self-regulate and sit in a classroomâare, as we all know, vital. Just two or three children can tear a class apart. Imagine having the entire class of children who have auditory inability to even hear a teacher. The solution is not loops, implants and large speakers; the solution is to eliminate the ear disease. Once those kids can sit and enjoy a class, then we have the luxury of talking about quality and the luxury of talking about what will engage kids and keep them coming to school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third element of the coalition's approach is to engage parents. My argument is a simple one: if you are a principal of a school, public or private, you are the CEO, but you have a board of directorsâand it is not your private school directors; it is your parents. They are the ones you are answering to. Let's see parents directly engaged, cheek and jowl, in Indigenous communities and having a say about what is taught in the curriculum. Over the last 10 years we have swung too farâexpunging Indigenous language from the curriculum. That was the wrong thing to do. We simply looked at the literacy outcome, saw that it was poor in Indigenous communities and said, 'It must be the teaching of Indigenous language that is making the English bad.' That was a short-sighted decision. It is rubbish. Educators know that a child can learn two languages at the same time. A child can speak a language at home and be taught another one at school with no problem. They just have to be fit, healthy, motivated and actually turning up every day.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's go from attendanceâand this Indigenous boarding initiative is one element of thatâfrom just turning up, to turning up every day, starting at breakfast, being well fed, and staying all day and not vanishing after the roll gets called. Let's make sure they go all day, every week, all year and make sure there is an appropriate celebration for that achievement. Finally, when that time comes and school can offer those children no moreâand, let's be honest; that is at different ages according to the individualâit is the government's responsibility to connect every one of those individuals with opportunity. We can talk a lot in here, but the one thing we are ultimately responsible for is provision of opportunity. I am not here to guarantee any sort of outcome or output, other than fundamentally give every individual the opportunity they deserve in a great nationâand we can do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment it is absolutely limited in Indigenous Australiaâwhere, as I said, 95 per cent of children know that there is nothing after graduation. Well, why go to school at all? We have a situation where we have not even audited the job opportunities within a community to work out what local Indigenous people can do. We have not even set up the complex arrangements to allow people from Indigenous communities to travel in a fly in, fly out arrangement to our regional centres and cities. That does not even exist yet. It works in the mining communities but it is yet to be adopted in this case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, ultimately, these boarding initiatives are the future. They are the segue between a complete educationâor as complete as you can get in a remote community, where often you only get newly graduated teachers with limited experienceâand being shipped out and completely expropriating the responsibility for education to an expensive boarding school down the road. In the middle there are a range of initiatives that are exciting. We have the opportunity to partner up schools, to have classes travel down, for instance, to a major city and reciprocationâacknowledging that, as a young mainstream Australian child, you can learn a whole heap by going to an Indigenous community. These arrangements can be achieved, but we have to think way more creatively about how we promote and support education in remote areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why have I devoted 95 per cent of my conversation to this? It is because that is the ultimate test of our system. It is how it looks after the most disadvantaged. In this bill we are looking after the special schools and special assistance schools and making sure that they do not go backwards. But the boarding initiative is also extremely promising. But I know one thing: you cannot pick out one or two Indigenous children, dress them up in a fancy private school uniform and say you have succeeded, because you have got another 98 children left behind there with nothing. Those two people lifted out of poverty may well have a career in the arts, in sports or in academia, but there is nothing left behind for the other 98. And I do have my doubts that a successful Indigenous Australian coming back to the community is going to transform that community. I do not think that is the case. I think we have to look at the denominator and lift everyone in the tide of opportunity and not rely on the stars coming back to tell people that there is a better life out thereâa life that seems absolutely untouchable and unreachable. So, please, I do not want to see too much focus on the stars. We need to have a complete focus on whole classrooms of children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In finishing, there is no point educating without opportunity at the end. There is no point educating without parental support. That will involve engaging parents who have no faith in the education system. But I rely on the expertise of teachers and attendance officers to bring those parents along at some point in that school year to sit and listen to their children read for the first time and see the trickle of a tear go down their face as they see their young kids achieving something that they never in their own life managed to. It is that transforming moment that can happen in the arms of an Indigenous teacher. That is why it is so truly special to practise in remote Australia. We can do it one by one with the children. Some of them will be travelling to boarding schools; others will choose other pathways. But the quality of the education in that community will rely, firstly, on attendance; secondly, on motivated teachers; thirdly, on autonomy for those principals; and, finally, on quality curriculaâsomething that the coalition is delivering.</span>

                    <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014. When it comes to education, this government has in fact quite a disgraceful record at all levels of education. At the moment we are seeing some of the higher-education cuts and an increase in fees to go to university. We also see those cuts extended through to primary schools, secondary schools and even right through to child care as well. We are seeing massive cuts right across the board when it comes to education, and we are especially seeing many broken promises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us remember the only reason that we are all here today debating this particular bill is another broken promise by this government to the Australian people, this time specifically on education. The fact is that the Abbott government reneged on their commitment to honour the Gonski funding agreements, and at the same time they introduced the biggest-ever cuts to our schools. We know that before the election they were all running around saying, 'We are all on a unity ticket when it comes to Gonski.' We had all the candidates running around saying that. I know that in my area in Richmond on the north coast of New South Wales all the National Party candidates, some of whom are now National Party members, were all running around the place saying, 'Yes, we are on a unity ticket. We will be funding it.' That, of course, turned out to be completely untrue. Not only has all the additional funding for the vital fifth and sixth years of Gonski reforms been cut but also $30 billion has been stripped from our schools over the next decade. This is the same as sacking one in seven teachers, and will mean an average of $3.2 million less per school, or $1,000 less support per student per year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts like that will be devastating, particularly to regional and rural areas like my electorate in terms of those massive cuts, and it will really impact the educational opportunities for our children into the future. The fact is that if the government had simply kept their promise of this unity ticket on Gonski there would be no need for this debate, and the benefits would already be flowing. They would already be in place. Let us have a look at it. Before the federal election the government promised full disability loading for education funding in 2015. Now that they have reneged on their promise to the Australian people we need to consider amendments relating to funding for independent special schools. That is why we are here. The fact is that this government shows no concern about equality in education or the future of our children, and it has been confirmed by their lack of funding commitments and their complete lack of creating an effective, sustainable, long-term education system. In fact, the coalition's policy when it comes to schools and education has been all over the place since the Gonski report was released, leaving the public with very little confidence in their ability to deliver when it comes to any educational reforms. Certainly the community has shown a lot of distrust and concern about the whole range of their cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare all of that to Labor's massive commitments to education when we were in governmentânot just in terms of Gonski, but also our Building the Education Revolution and what that meant for our schools. I know that in my electorate there was over $100 million for 90 schoolsâit really transformed the infrastructure for our schools and made a big difference. I truly stand with my community in supporting the Gonski reforms, as this really was the mechanism for greater accountability and transparency in the delivery of funding for our schools. Indeed, many parents tell me how important they felt it was, and it really was an absolute game changer when it came to education funding. In fact, the Gonski reforms got it right when it came to students, particularly with disability students from Indigenous backgrounds or from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had commissioned this review into school funding, led by David Gonski, when we were in government, and in preparing the Gonski report there were more than 7,000 submissions received, over 39 schools were visited and 71 key education groups across Australia were consulted. It was the biggest review this country has had into education funding in over 40 years, and it was the most extensive. The review identified the problems facing the education sector and the issues that many schools face, particularly with growing inequality, falling results, increasing numbers of lower-performing students and, concerningly, decreasing numbers of some high-performing students. The report was thoroughly researched, and it was backed by very extensive and involved transparent evidence. When the Gonski panel handed down their independent report, which really was a fantastic opportunity to genuinely reform our schools, it not only outlined the problems and challenges but also identified many of the solutions that could be put in place. Those solutions just cannot be thrown aside because this government does not believe in proper funding for our education system. They need to be looking at it closely to see how they can really reform our education system, and it is very disappointing that we are now here today because they have not properly funded our schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has four main components. The first main component is providing support for Indigenous students in boarding schools. This is welcomed, as it is entirely consistent with Labor policies in providing greater support for our Indigenous students. Labor strongly believes in the need to close the gap for Indigenous students, and understands that this is specifically connected with the raising of educational outcomes. Unlike when the other side were in opposition, we are not going to oppose worthy legislation just for the sake of political grandstanding, as they do. We have demonstrated that we are a fair and constructive opposition examining government plans on merit and putting the needs of Australians first and, in this case, putting the needs of Australian students first. We have widely acknowledged, here today, on this side that this debate has been brought on unnecessarily because of the broken promises made by the Liberal-National government but that we will be supporting this measure so as to maintain the funding for education. We recognise how important it is. The initiative also creates the instrument for the minister to make necessary payments prescribed by regulation and allows the payment of $6.8 million in 2014-15 to non-government boarding schools with more than 50 Indigenous boarders or more than 50 per cent of boarders who are Indigenous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second main component of this bill is to enable continued funding for independent special schoolsâanother catch-up measure that would not have been needed if they had not broken their election promise on Gonski. Because the government has not finalised the loading for students with disability or provided the additional funding it promised from 2015, this bill has had to be introduced. Essentially, this bill will apply a bandaid to a problem of the government's own making by allowing changes to the funding-transition rules for independent special schools. Under this bill their funding will now be indexed by at least three per cent a year. Approximately 38 independent special schools will no longer face prospects of significant funding cuts under the Act in 2015. Again, this all could have been avoided if they had honoured their election commitments. If we look to some of those election commitments, and we look particularly to one made by the now-education minister, who said before the election, and I will quote him:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If elected to government the coalition will continue the data collection work that has commenced, which will be used to deliver more funding for people with disability through the disability loading in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was said on 23 August 2013 by the now-education minister. This pre-election commitment has been totally broken by the government failing to extend the $100 million per year More Support for Students with Disability transition funding in the budget, and with the minister now claiming that additional funding for students with a disability was not promised and that the disability loading would be funded from within the existing funding envelopes. We see yet another broken promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third main component of this bill is to delay the implementation of the school-improvement plans by one year to January 2016. In fact, the school improvement plans were developed by the independent Australian Council for Educational Research. They were supported by the states and had enjoyed bipartisan political support. The school improvement plans are not particularly onerous. They were designed to make sure that the money for resources for the students who need it the most is delivered and that the extra Gonski investment Labor made in our schools actually makes a difference in classrooms. This bill is to facilitate further changes to school improvement plan requirements in 2015 as a consequence of the minister's review of the command and control requirements of the school funding system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a school level, the school improvement plans ensure there is accountability for the additional Gonski investment and that reforms to teaching and learning are in fact being implemented. Schools already make improvement plans and track their progress. The vast majority of schools will have to do absolutely nothing more in order to satisfy these requirements. So the government has been caught out yet again, with absolutely no idea when it comes to schools and no idea as to the educational needs of our children to ensure their futures. In fact, in most states and territories and, indeed, in the Catholic system plans that satisfy the requirements of the act are already in place and functioning well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need an appropriate level of reporting to make sure that these reforms do what they are supposed to doâhelp every child in every school to improve their results. However, the changes foreshadowed as a result of the government's command and control review are likely to significantly weaken accountability under the Gonski reforms. That is indeed disappointing. Such changes would require further amendments to the act and/or regulations. A year after the government broke its promise about the Gonski agreements we are here trying to fix its mistakes. It is unfortunate but that is the reality we face here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth main component of this bill is to address a number of errors and omissions through some amendments to cater for transitionary provisions. The government talks about the need to ensure certainty and to make sure that transitional recurrent funding can continue, but the changes that this bill seeks to introduce to the act to supposedly deal with errors and omissions would not have been needed if it had simply kept its word and honoured its commitments to the Australian people. Yes, I am repeating that but that is because it really goes to the heart of why we are all here today. They are absolutely playing catch-up when it comes to education and the vital importance of education for our younger people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should be keeping their promise to honour the Gonski agreements and work to improve schools. That is what our communities want. It is what my community is always telling me. It is what parents are saying as well. They have particularly grave concerns when it comes to this government's lack of investment in education throughout all the years of their children's schooling. Lately they are particularly concerned about higher education funding. Many people in rural and regional areas like mine now say that university is not an option for their children because of the proposed deregulation of university fees. It is hard enough for kids from the country to access higher education, but with the deregulation of fees many have told me it will be off their radar as it will not be possible for their kids to get to school. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are angry and disappointed that that is on the agenda. They are also upset that there are funding cuts as well. That is what we have seen from this government. We have seen cuts to the vital additional funding for the fifth and sixth years of the Gonski reforms. We have seen the $80 billion of cuts, which we refer to a lot, from schools and hospitals over the next decade. It will be absolutely appalling for the services that are required. Let us look at the cuts to future school funding through fixing the indexation rate to the lower rate of the CPI. As we know, the budget papers are predicting the CPI to be at just 2.5 per cent, whereas the current ABS education price index currently is at 5.1 per cent. So we know there will be a cut. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election the government was running around promising that there would be no nasty surprisesâyou will not see any cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to pensions and no changes. People now feel very betrayed. They feel they have been misled by the government across a whole range of issues. Before the election we did not have any government members telling anyone the truth about what they were in fact proposing. There was no mention of the GP tax, which is devastating for areas like mine, particularly for many elderly people and many families that are struggling. There was no mention of hurting families and pensioners with their proposed petrol tax. There was no mention of any cuts to the age pension as well, which will also be devastating in areas like mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to education, families are very concerned about what the future will hold for their children in accessing all levels of education. In New South Wales we also have the state government cutting education and TAFE funding, making it doubly hard. We are seeing Liberal-National governments at both the state and federal levels making it incredibly difficult for people from rural and regional areas, who do feel those cuts a lot more harshly. They are very concerned and angry that what they have here is a government of broken promises that cannot be trusted. They do compare it to when we were in government and we invested so much in education. We had detailed and complex plans through the Gonski report and flowing from that to make sure that those people who are vulnerable and disadvantaged are able to access decent and fair education systems. We know all reports say that education is the great equaliser and provides great opportunity for people to excel. We know how important that is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regional areas like mine we saw firsthand how important that investment was. As I said earlier, there was more than $100 million through the Building the Education Revolution invested in nearly 90 schools. Many of those schools had been neglected for many years so to have that level of investment has been absolutely astounding in terms of the infrastructure improvements. That massive level of investment, combined with our plans through Gonski, meant that those people from disadvantaged backgrounds were going to be able to get access to very good education systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, people are devastated that this government essentially misled them by saying that they were on a unity ticket. I recall at many forums during the election campaign the National Party candidate telling people that. I can tell you that people are pretty angry about that. They are angry about the Nationals for a whole range of reasons, including all their broken promises. I think education is one of the top ones up with the GP tax, the petrol tax and the cuts to pensions as well. As I have said many times in this place, you cannot trust the National Party. When it comes to the cuts to education you can certainly see in areas like mine on the north coast of New South Wales that the Nationals cannot be trusted. Their policies and plans are hurting the people of the north coast of New South Wales. They will certainly be punished for that, because people are very much aware of the very cruel and harsh nature of this budget and what the National Party's actions have done to people living in areas like my electorate of Richmond.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill ensures that the government delivers on our election commitment that schools would certainly not be worse off under our government, by ensuring continued transition arrangements for special schools and special assistance schools. In effect, this bill prevents cuts of approximately $2.4 million in 2014-15 that would have occurred under the legislation to certain independent special schools and special assistance schools. I point out that our government has been very serious about our commitment to improving education outcomes and delivering on our absolute commitment to education funding, despite the budgetary challenges we inherited from the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is worth mentioning that just last month we found out the true extent of Labor's economic mismanagement. Having previously promised a surplus, in his last budget Wayne Swan admitted a budget deficit of $18 billion. That would have been bad enough, but now, with the final budget outcome for 2013-14, we know that it in fact ended up being a $48.5 billion deficitâa deterioration in excess of $30 billion. That is the real figure, not the fiction that was promised every budget night. In fact, Labor never got it right; every single budget estimate turned out to be so much worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final budget outcome confirms that Labor delivered six successive deficits, totalling $240 billion with many more to come. So I think it is a bit rich that, no matter what the legislationâand we have seen it again todayâwe always witness a conga line of Labor MPs talking about funding cuts and decrying the fact that we are not spending more money on X, Y or Z. The fact is we do not have money to splash around. Thanks to Labor, we have a huge debt to pay backâand it is costing us more than $1 billion every month to service that debt. Just imagine what we could have done with that money had Labor not been so reckless. So members opposite ought to be honest enough to admit that the reason we have considerable constraints on government spending is because of their own inept economic management. The reality is that we have to prioritiseâand we have a responsibility to ensure value for money, but we will always make sure that our approach is fair. That is exactly what our government is doing with the Students First education policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to report to the House that I have had very positive feedback on the recent review of the national curriculum. The curriculum is one example of how we can improve education outcomes without necessarily having to spend a lot more money. The feedback I have had from local parentsâand I did a series of listening posts in my electorate late last weekâis that the issues identified in the review are concerns that parents share: overcrowding of the curriculum and not enough focus on getting the basics right. So I think identifying those issues is a step in the right direction. Just as this bill is an important step in the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make sure that special schools which provide support for students with a disability have the resources they need, and we want to ensure that our Indigenous students have the best possible opportunity, including when they attend boarding schools. Again, when it comes to Indigenous education, this government has already shown how serious we are about improving outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the problem with the delivery of a range of Indigenous programs has been the complex layers of bureaucracy. The Australian National Audit Office reported that in 2011 there were 210 Indigenous-specific Australian government programs and subprograms included in its Closing the Gap activities, administered by more than 40 agencies, across 17 separate portfolios, with the best estimate of expenditure totalling $4.2 billion in 2011-12.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As promised, our government has delivered a new Indigenous Advancement Strategy, IAS, which began on 1 July 2014. Most Australians are probably unaware that under the IAS more than 150 individual programs and activities have been replaced with five flexible, broad-based programs based on the policy areas of: jobs, land and economy; children and schooling; safety and wellbeing; culture and capability; and remote Australia strategies. The objectives of the IAS reflect our strong belief that education is the key to truly closing the gap and improving the lives of Indigenous Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The particular focus of the new strategy is: getting Indigenous Australians into work, fostering Indigenous business and ensuring Indigenous people receive economic and social benefits from the effective management of their land and native title rights; ensuring children go to school, improving literacy and numeracy and supporting families to give children a good start in life; increasing year 12 attainment and pathways to further training and education; making communities safer so that Indigenous people enjoy similar levels of physical, emotional and social wellbeing as that enjoyed by other Australians; increasing participation and acceptance of Indigenous Australians in the economic and social life of the nation; and addressing the disproportionate disadvantage in remote Australia. The new flexible program structure supports a new way of working with Indigenous people, communities, industries, business and service providers, allowing for joint development of solutions that will work over the long term, including through regional or local solutions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that an open grant funding round of the IAS opened on 8 September, and applications closed last week. This new approach provides a simplified framework for government funding of programs that genuinely assist Indigenous Australians. But I note, especially in the area of education, there is also much that can be achieved with community and business support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to make mention of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation which is a private-enterprise-led organisation that does tremendous work. It is chaired by Warren Mundine and offers scholarships to schools as well as tertiary education. I also note that earlier this month BHP Billiton, which is already a major partner of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation, announced it was providing $28.8 million to the CSIRO to establish a new education program to support Indigenous students in science, technology, engineering and maths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Science, and having a degree in engineering, encouraging people into these disciplines is a subject very dear to my heart and on which I have spoken many times in this place. I think it is tremendous that this special five-year program, designed by the CSIRO and building on already successful Indigenous education programs, will encourage more Indigenous Australians to study in these fields and improve their career opportunities. I congratulate BHP Billiton and the CSIRO on their commitment to this new program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear there is so much good will and determination from within all levels of government, community and in business to help improve educational opportunities for our Indigenous students, and that is to be commended. In the years to come, we need to remain vigilant, to ensure that the good will and the funding provides real, sustainable outcomes which can be reflected in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ap</span> report, that has become an annual report card to the nation on Indigenous disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous Boarding Initiative, which was announced in the budget and is facilitated by this bill, is another $6.8 million investment that aims to meet an identified resourcing shortfall for those boarding schools with large numbers of students from remote areas. In 2013 a joint review was undertaken to analyse the costs borne by non-government boarding schools with substantial numbers of Indigenous students from remote communities. The review's report was the basis for our decision to allocate around $6.8 million in 2015 as an interim measure while a broader review is conducted. So this bill is very much a practical measure to address identified problems, and in that sense it reflects the common sense approach of our government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could debate all day the shortcomings of successive governments when it comes to Indigenous education. There have been failings all round despite a plethora of good intentions. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his Closing the Gap address earlier this year, last year in metropolitan areas, only 81 per cent of Indigenous year 9 students met the national minimum standards for reading. In very remote areas, just 31 per cent of Indigenous students reached the same minimum standard. As the Prime Minister pointed out, one of the worst forms of neglect is failing to give children the education they need for a decent life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our job, particularly in relation to remote Indigenous communities, is to break the tyranny of low expectations. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister indicated that Indigenous school attendance data will be part of the next <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the Gap</span> report and all subsequent reports under this government. Studies clearly show that the lower the attendance rate, the more likely it is that a school will have problems. That is why truancy laws exist. But we have not applied the same principles and expectations to Indigenous children and that is why there remains a significant gap between education outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are some very positive examples of how change can be implemented and produce outstanding results. The Cape York Aboriginal Australian Academy has overseen a high-expectation education approach in a number of communities. Primary school attendance has radically improved as a result. In 2008, the school attendance rate in Aurukun was 36 per cent; now it is 73 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to keep striving and implementing policies that work, and we have to ensure that the expectations that we hold for the wider Australian community are also applicable to Indigenous communities. This bill, in ensuring funding to facilitate and support those students attending boarding schools, is just one example of how this government is working to close the gap. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWA" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014. Labor believes that every school can and should be offered the opportunity to support and to nurture their students to the best of its ability. Schools have a right and an obligation to offer the highest standard of education and support, just as students have the right to expect a quality education, tailored to meet their needs, attributes and abilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It sounds too good to be true, but believe it or not, such a program was underway and becoming a reality under the previous Labor government. The needs based school funding model, known as the Gonski model, provided this support and care to our schools and students by allocating funding and resources where they were most needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election the current government promised that they were on a unity ticket with Labor on a needs based funding model but, unfortunately, they have since broken this promise to the Australian people and have refused to fund years 5 and 6 of the program. Not only have they breached the trust of the Australian community but they have also breached the signed agreements with the states and territories. They signed a six-year agreement, not a four-year agreement with the federal Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One can imagine that Labor Party members and Labor Party governments would be upset with this broken promise but, indeed, we do not have to look too far to see that it is Liberal state governments who are also very upset about this broken promise. When it comes to school funding, we have seen Premier Napthine still demanding answers from the Abbott government regarding its decision to scrap years 5 and 6 of the Gonski model. And Minister Piccoli from New South Wales has been on the record on many occasions, raising the issue of the Abbott government abandoning the Gonski model and the funding that goes with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So if the government acted as the adults they profess to be and if they said what they meant and did what they said, then we would not necessarily be in a situation where schools are facing uncertainty into the future, state governments are facing uncertainty into the future andâwhat is worseâstudents in areas that need resources the most are potentially going to miss out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And if the government had kept their promise to deliver the full disability loading in 2015, we would not need to debate amendments relating to funding for independent special schools. We have heard nothing from the government about their progress in the rollout of the full disability loading. We have not heard a new time frame or a schedule; all we know is that it seems the disability loading will not be on schedule or on time. Indeed, there does not seem to be replacement money. While Labor was in government, we put funding in for that gap for students with a disability. Not only have the government broken their promise to rule out the full disability loading by 2015 but they are offering no extra support for schools in state systems or indeed for independent and Catholic systems to actually assist those students with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government had a coherent schools policy and if they cared about classroom outcomes I would not need to stand here and fight for students with a disability or defend Labor's Gonski reforms and argue for greater transparency and responsibility in school funding. All in all, when it comes to real reform within our schools, better support for students with a disability and better support for those students that need the extra support, this government has no record to defend except a litany of broken promises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill in front of us today enables the minister to make payments to schools for reasons outlined in regulation. The government have already announced that they will facilitate the payment of around $6.8 million in support to boarding schools in 2014-15. This will assist schools with more than 50 Indigenous boarders from remote communities or where more than 50 per cent of boarders are Indigenous and come from remote communities. Labor supports this and supports any reasonable measure that closes the gap in school education. But supporting boarding schools cannot be used as an argument to leave other schools in rural and regional communities behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every child in every school must have the resources they need to enable them to do their best, not for four years but ongoing. This is what the Gonski school funding model is all about. It absolutely applies to schools in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities throughout Australia and, indeed, all rural and regional communities throughout Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing to see the Nationals when it comes to the Gonski funding model, again roll over and accept a bad deal for rural and regional students. Because we know that under the Gonski funding, there would be loadings to help rural and regional schools, to help schools in lower socioeconomic areas, to help those with higher enrolments of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander's, and to help those students with a disability. What we have seen is this government walk away from that. A key priority for the governmentâand what you would expectâis: regardless of where our students live and whatever school they attend, they can get a world-class education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Closing the gap in educational attainment of Indigenous Australians requires a lot of effort. Really, we need to see resources go to every single school right across this country. Labor is fundamentally committed to this goal. Boarding schools are part of the solution for students in communities who want to use them. Boarding does play an important role in helping our predominantly high school Indigenous students access subject choice and opportunity that otherwise might be unavailable. Support for Indigenous students attending boarding schools is consistent with Labor's policies in government and we therefore support it. But we call on the government to reinstate years 5 and 6, as I already mentioned, of the Gonski school funding that would give extra funding to schools that need it, particularly in rural and regional areas, and would attract all those different loadings to support students with the resources they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election, the government promised to implement Labor's Gonski school funding reforms, including the loading for students with a disability in 2015. Instead, the government have cut support for students with disability and are delaying changes that would make sure every student with a disability gets the support they need to achieve their best. Days before the election, the now Minister for Education promised:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If elected to government the coalition will continue the data collection work that has commenced, which will be used to deliver more funding for people with disability through the 'disability loading' in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the election, however, students with a disability together with their parents and carers have been somewhat ignored by this minister and by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Treasurer's budget, the government cut $100 million from the More Support for Students with Disabilities program and has since failed to replace it with the promised additional funds. Stakeholders are now also reporting the government has dropped the ball when it comes to the finalisation of the full Gonski loading. Consultation is thin on the ground and when it does occur, it seems to be rushed, sloppy and secretive. Because of this, the government will not deliver the promised additional funding together with the full Gonski loading for students with a disability by the beginning of next year. We will not see the $100 million in support of More Support for Students with Disabilities from 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Education Amendment Bill seeks to change the funding transition guidelines for independent special schools so their funding is indexed by at least three per cent a yearâcoincidentally the same level of guaranteed indexation under Labor's Gonski reforms. Yet again we see before us another change that would otherwise be irrelevant if the government implemented the full disability loading for 2015 as promised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Gonski reforms there were six additional loadings, including for: small schools; remote schools; Indigenous students; students with low English; students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and students with disability. Each of these loadings, with the exception of students with a disability, were fully defined when the Australian Education Act was introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The full implementation of the loading for students with a disability was scheduled for 2015. This was to allow time for data collection, along with further work with the states and schools to ensure the final disability loading would give students the adequate resources they need to achieve their best. Current definitions of disabilities that attract extra support vary significantly between jurisdictions. The ongoing collection of data is designed to create a streamlined and uniform system across Australia, where the same or similar disability in different states is treated with parity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the interim, Labor had funded $100 million per year for the More Support for Students with Disabilities program, ensuring those students would have access to assistance they required while the state, territories and the Commonwealth worked to finalise the full Gonski disability loading in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter does need attention by government to ensure that we see the rollout is properly done, that the data is collected, that consultation has occurred, and that this work is done thoroughly and not ignored and put to the side. We support the funding of independent special schools next year but we reject the government's broken promises that they cannot deliver a loading for students with a disability. I urge the minister not to put this on the backburner. Do not put this to the side as you have done for the last year. Put it back on the agenda and give some attention to it rather than adopting a piecemeal approach that does not reflect commitment and drive. That is what this matter needs and I urge the minister to do so.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key component of this bill will delay the implementation of school improvement plans by one year to January 2016. We know that the government likes to advertise that this is all about tackling bureaucracy, but in reality it about the watering down of accountability and transparency in our schools. We have all heard in this place the Minister for Education tell us how money alone will not improve our schools, but what we are now seeing from this government is a sneaky move which will not improve student results. It was the school improvement plans that worked with schools on how to improve results and how to spend the money to improve results. With this delay the government are taking the education sector down a path of hands-off and a no-strings-attached approach to school funding. Quite frankly, this is a backwards step and, despite what the government will argue, these plans are really important. They are really important to parents. I do not know if the minister has spoken to a parent any time recently but parents are saying that they want to know what the plans are for their schools. They want to know where the school is being taken. They do not want someone in Canberra to overly manage them. We know that school communities can manage themselves but parents want to know what the plan is for the future and how their school is going to get better. These were a very important part of a nationally consistent approach. It seems, once again, that the government are walking away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The school improvement plans are making sure that money invested in our schools by the federal government actually reaches the classrooms and improves results, a critically important thing. One would think that a minister who professes to care about education would want that. The evidence that sits behind these plans has been independently developed and enforced by all states and territories, both Liberal and Labor, and by the Australian Council for Educational Research. We need an appropriate level of funding to ensure these reforms do what they are designed to do, to help every child in every school improve their results and performance. I am very pleased to say that the vast majority of schools are already making improvement plans to track their progress. Most schools will not have to do anything in order to satisfy these requirements. Once again, it seems illogical but it seems as though it is the federal government that is not interested in ensuring that we have every school performing well. It is very disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, there are elements of this bill that Labor does support, but we certainly will not be sitting back and taking these cuts in years 5 and 6 of the Gonski reforms. We will hold the government to account.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs GRIGGS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of a bill that has a national focus but which brings extremely positive benefits in Northern Australia and particularly across the length and breadth of the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014 is a much-needed piece of legislation that boarding schools in the Territory and nationally, which house Indigenous students, have been waiting for. It signals changes to the Australian Education Act 2013, on which I have been working closely with my friend and colleague, the education minister, Christopher Pyne, to have introduced. It is with great pleasure and a measure of pride that I am able to speak to these amendments today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments have a number of provisions, but it is the one that relates to Indigenous boarding schools which I am particularly interested in and which will be the focus of my comments here today. During the time they spent together in the Northern Territory's East Arnhem region last month, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs put special emphasis on improving educational outcomes for Aboriginal people, particularly across Northern Australia. One of the key focuses was on school attendance, which varies between one community and another but in some cases can be as low as 30 per cent. My Northern Territory Country Liberal Party colleague Senator Scullion has been doing some great work in that space around trying to cut truancy numbers in communities, but this legislation is part of a suite of measures to improve Indigenous education outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around Australia, boarding colleges provide accommodation for Indigenous students who, in many cases, travel hundreds and hundreds of kilometres from remote communities to continue their education. In the Northern Territory thousands of Indigenous students have attended boarding schools over many years and have been the recipients of a learning stream that would not have been available to them in their communities. In my electorate of Solomon, which encompasses Darwin and Palmerston, we are fortunate to have Kormilda College, Marrara Christian School, Northern Territory Christian College and St John's Catholic College. These outstanding institutions have been providing vital learning and accommodation services for Indigenous students for many years. These services are not limited to my electorate. Other educational institutions providing these vital services across the Territory include St Philip's College, Tiwi College, Woolaning Homeland Christian College and Yirara College in Alice Springs. Some of these institutions have been financially impacted by the former Labor government's policies. One Labor minister after another came to the Territory and promised to fix their wrong. But they never did. It is this government, the Abbott government, that is yet again fixing the mistakes of the former Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By way of background, the Australian Education Act 2013 is the principal legislation by which the Australian government provides financial assistance to approved authorities for government and non-government schools. The act was a product of the previous Labor government but only took effect from January this year. Under its requirements, state and territory governments distribute funds to approved authorities to public, private and independent schools, in line with the requirements of the act. This year alone, around $14 billion will be paid to government and non-government schools under the Australian Education Act, and the Commonwealth is investing a record $64.5 billion in schools over the next four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments being discussed here today will create a mechanism that enables payments to be made under the government's newly established Indigenous Boarding Initiative, which is required to provide additional recurrent funding in 2014 to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boarding students at non-government schools. The Indigenous Boarding Initiative was announced in this year's budget to rectify a shortfall in funding that had been identified in an independent review. Under the amendments before the House today, more funding is available to schools if they have more than 50 Indigenous boarding students from remote or very remote Australia or more than 50 per cent of their boarders are Indigenous and from remote or very remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous Boarding Initiative will provide around $6.8 million in additional funding in 2014 to non-government schools that meet the criteria to provide boarding students with the essential services and support they need to achieve a high-quality education. This initiative recognises the cost pressures faced by schools that support Indigenous students from remote areas and will address a resourcing shortfall. When I was in opposition a number of Territory schools with a large number of Indigenous boarders contacted me to outline their concerns. In particular, they were concerned that what was currently being provided was not enough and that additional funding would be required to enable them to meet the costs of providing boarding and tuition to cater for the additional needs of these students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Labor ministers Garrett and Crean, and other former Labor ministers such as my fellow Territorian the member for Lingiari, promised to fix this funding issue. But that never came about. This issue stems back to the 2010 electionâbefore I was elected. Labor were big on promises and slack on delivery back then, and this is a classic example. It has been left to this government to deliver on this very important issueâand I thank Minister Pyne for listening and for making sure that occurs. I want to thank in particular the principals and school councils of Kormilda College and St John's College, who worked with me to put the case forward to Minister Pyne. I know that, when he visited the various schools across the Territory, he was able to see firsthand the implications of not fixing this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I brought to the attention of the House in May last year that Kormilda College, which has around 220 students from outback communities across the Territory, was considering cutting its Indigenous programs if the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government did not attend to serious shortfalls in funding. Labor, loves to claimâfalselyâthat it is the champion of the disadvantaged and of Indigenous Australians, but the school was running at a shortfall of $500,000 as a result of the previous Labor government's funding cuts. This prompted the then principal of Kormilda College to state: 'We're in financial difficulties based on the change in funding that is taking place'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In developing the Indigenous Boarding Initiative, the Abbott government also considered the findings of an independent review that identified significant additional costs faced by non-government schools with a large number of Indigenous boarding students. In response, and as I have already mentioned, the Abbott government provided an estimated additional $6.8 million in the 2014-15 budget for the Indigenous Boarding Initiative. This will support eligible schools; and a broader welfare review, including a review of Abstudy, will be conducted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This extra funding has turned a serious fail into a very strong pass for boarding schools and Indigenous students, particularly those in the Northern Territory. The eight schools I mentioned earlier are among 21 eligible non-government boarding schools in the Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. The extra funding will allow eligible schools to provide improved services to Indigenous boarding students from remote or very remote areas and provide effective additional support to boost school attendance and engagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is remarkable to me that the previous Labor government was so uninterested in issues associated with remote education that they allowed such a funding shortfall to have such an impact on Indigenous students and boarding schools across the country. The member for Jagajaga, the member for Adelaide and the member for Lingiari all cannot wait to jump up on their soapboxes and spread misinformation about coalition policies, but at the same time they were quite prepared to leave Indigenous boarding schools and Indigenous students high and dry. It is absolutely outrageous. It was a pretty sorry effort by the Labor government, and it took the coalition government, with its determination to bring lasting benefits in all areas of Indigenous development, including education, to fix up this mess. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the subject of the Labor Party and the misinformation it is spreading out in the community, I want to take this opportunity to put on record the full extent of the coalition's funding profile in the Northern Territory. The deception from those opposite is incredible. The Labor Party love to talk about cuts. Those over there are as mad as cut snakes, and they are about as trustworthy as cut snakes too. They are a sinister crowd who are tryingâand, I hope, failingâto spread their poison into the broader community. In the Northern Territory, for instance, there is $272.5 million more funding, and this point has been acknowledged by the Territory Minister for Education and Deputy Chief Minister, Peter Chandler. The total Commonwealth funding to all schools in the Northern Territory will increase by $108.9 million, a 53.9 per cent increase, over the forward estimates. The annual increase for all Northern Territory schools, government and non-government schools, for recurrent and capital spending, in 2014-15, will be 28.6 per cent; in 2015-16, it will be 8.1 per cent; in 2016-17, it will be 9.1 per cent; and in 2017-18, there will be an increase of 1.6 per cent. The first-year funding is extremely high, and this is to redress issues associated with the Territory's historically low funding base. The total Commonwealth funding to government schools in the Northern Territory will grow by $66.3 million by 2017-18, which is a 72 per cent increase from the 2013-14 to 2017-18 financial years, while the non-government sector will grow by 38.8 per cent over the same period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to once again congratulate Minister Pyne for his commitment to improving education outcomes in the Territory. I want to close by briefly touching on other components contained within this amendment bill. The bill provides funding certainty for 16 independent special schools and special assistance schools that would otherwise see their funding reduced from next year. These schools will now transition towards the standards consistent with other schools. This government has already extended the More Support for Students with Disabilities funding in 2014 which was cut by the previous government. The bill extends the commencement of school improvement planning requirements. This extension will provide regulatory certainty for schools while we continue to identify command-and-control requirements with states and territories. We are also ensuring that schools moving between approved authorities will not be financially advantaged or disadvantaged. This bill also corrects the location loading that applies to major city schools, ensuring the right approved authorities attract the location loading needed and that funding entitlements can be correctly pro-rata-ed where a school does not operate for a full year. There are also a number of smaller yet equally important amendments brought by this bill that I stand in support of this afternoon. These amendments are transparent, wide-ranging and necessary. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="L6P" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MacTIERNAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  I would perhaps like to offer a bit of antivenom to deal with the member for Solomon's very 'snakey' comments! I think we can be pretty mature here and recognise that representatives of all parties in this place are very, very enthusiastic about the agenda to advance the position of Aboriginal people in this country and to address the endemic problems that we have seen emerge over the last few decades in Aboriginal education. Difficulty in education really has been undermining Aboriginal people being able to take their rightful place in our economy and our society. I think we have got to get a little bit beyond this sort of absurdity of pretending that only one party is interested, and indeed we would very much like to be recognised as being great promoters of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difficulty is that these issues in relation to Aboriginal education and the advancement of Aboriginal people are very complex, and it has been established over many years that there are no easy answers here. It is very much a case of black and white Australians having to work to together to explore all of the opportunities. Labor took its commitments under Closing the Gap very seriously, and I think we can demonstrate that there were some achievements. But no-one would ever argue that we have resolved all of the problems. This is going to be something that will require many decades of dedication to deal with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleagues have outlined many of the shortcomings of the legislation, but, like a number of members, I really want to focus on the Indigenous education aspects of this bill and, in particular, the Indigenous boarding initiative. My engagement in Aboriginal education has gone on for some time, but at the moment I chair a group called the Martu Education Advisory Group. The Martu are a group of Aboriginal people who occupy parts of the Western Desert and eastern Pilbara regions. They have asked me to become involved in helping them progress their educational agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a great honour to be involved in that. The chairman of the WDLAC board, the native title group for the Martu, Brian Samson, says that he and his community really understand that they were left behind in the mining boom because they did not have the education to seize that opportunity. Indeed, we had a meeting a month or so ago on a Saturday up in Telfer to work out how we were going to take the education agenda forward. Telfer has regrouped now as a company town. The goldmining company employs some 1,000 people, and we would be lucky if 20 or 30 of those people were Aboriginal or Martu people, whilst there are hundreds of Martu people who would benefit from those employment opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly we have a real disconnect. Here we have an area where there is indeed a big employer, but the ability for the Aboriginal community to access that employment is very limited. Part of the problemânot all of itâis the ability of Aboriginal people to access education and really be in a position where they can be competitive for this employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to say that the community has been very interested in the explicit-instruction model that we have seen working pretty well in Cape York. There is a view that attendance at the school and the achievement of the schools, despite the best endeavours of a great many dedicated teachers, has really not been good, and we cannot keep doing more of the same. The community has had considerable interaction with the work on the Cape York Peninsula. Indeed, a group of Martu visited the four schools on the Cape York Peninsula and came away very much convinced that this was the path that had to be tried. We had to get a more intensive, explicit instructional method that would be more suited to the needs of the Martu students and at the same time recognise that there had to be an enhanced commitment from the parents to ensure that their children attended school because, no matter how good your methodology is, if the children are not at school, that methodology is not going to assist them. It has to be something that works together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the problems, in my experience working with quite a number of schools in disadvantaged areas over my 20 years of public life, is that, when children fail at school, they do not want to go to school. Failures in the instructional method feed into absenteeism because no-one wants to go to a place where they feel they are dumb, unable to keep up with the work that is being presented and that they are getting nothing out of it. So these are complex issues, but I am very pleased to say that the Martu now are working very constructively with Cape York and with the direct-instruction initiative. Cape York Academy, which is administering the new federal program, has agreed to involve the Martu in that next phase of the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole embrace of explicit instruction in these remote communities very much is a bipartisan approach. Noel Pearson will recognise that it was the direct intervention of Jenny Macklin and Julia Gillard that ensured that this model was able to get up in those Cape York schools. I think we have to keep that bipartisan support going for this initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to secondary school, it is the view of the board that we would be very much better, rather than sending children away to secondary boarding school in Perth, where many students struggle with homesickness, keeping up with the general standard at those schools and social isolation, to focus on establishing a residential college in one of the larger towns in the Pilbara. For example, we are looking particularly at Newman. The idea there is that you would provide a college or residential facility that would provide not only the accommodation but the pastoral support and also the additional instruction for students who would then go off and attend the state government high school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This seems to me to have many benefits. It would ensure that we had the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in those areas of the Pilbara really interacting strongly at school and forging the friendships that one does across the cultural divide. We see that as more positive than taking a few of these kids out and putting them into boarding schools down in Perth and separating them from their communities. We also see that, for many of these kids who struggle with homesickness, the ability to go home on a weekend or long weekend is going to be something extremely beneficial. They will be in an area where they are still connected with their friends and their family.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the model of supporting private boarding schools, good though it isâand I accept that, as the member for Solomon said, there is a real need there and in some places this works very well. I urge the government to be prepared to look at this other model, which certainly is going to be much more beneficial model I think for Western Australia. We have very small communities. In the communities I am talking about we have seven schools: Punmu, Parngurr, Kunawarritji, Strelley, Warralong, Jigalong and Nullagine. So these are seven really quite small communities. Jigalong and Nullagine are a little bigger, but the others are very small schools. We accept that we cannot deliver secondary education in those communities and the students will have to come to a larger centre, but we want that to be a centre within the Pilbara that gives these kids the opportunity to be with their family and their friends but at the same time to have that opportunity to step up to higher academic standards. They will be in a strong, supported environment, giving them the opportunity to go out there and forge their way forward in an environment that will be much more nurturing for their culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to comment on some matters made by the member for Bowman about language instruction. Look, I think perhaps he is right in part that there has been a bit of an overcorrection on this issue of the introduction of instruction in the local language. But the balance I have seen best placed is that out in some of these schools like Hope Vale, where the medium of instruction is English. I think parents in Aboriginal communities strongly support that. They want to make sure that their children have a very strong grasp of the English language. But we should not shy away from at the same time ensuring that there is also taught the written form of the language which they speak at home or more generally in the community. In places that we are dealing with in the Martu lands this is going to be very complicated, because there are, indeed, so many different languages spoken in any one community that it is going to be somewhat difficult getting an agreed language and an agreed orthography. But I do think it is important that the medium of instruction be English but that we fully embrace introducing students to the written form of their first language.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to support the Indigenous boarding initiative, but I do urge the minister to consider whether or not he could broaden that funding to take into account the sorts of facilities that the Martu are keen to set up, because certainly in the Pilbara we do not have any non-government boarding schools and we do want to do what we can to allow the children coming from these very tiny communities to remain in the Pilbara where we believe they will prosper and achieve more educationally than if they were sent down to Perth.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  This bill, as we know, will create a mechanism to enable payments to be made under the government's Indigenous boarding initiative, an initiative designed to provide additional recurrent funding in 2014 to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boarding students at non-government schools. I know from my former school days as well as on-going contact I have had with my former school that the Indigenous boarding students at Immanuel College have made some great contributions to the school over the years and also to their local communities when they have returned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A school in my electorate that caters for indigenous Australians is Warriappendi. Their main purpose is to support young Aboriginal people to re-engage in formal education processes. The school provides a valuable role in providing a safe, challenging learning environment for young people who have previously had significant difficulties in traditional secondary schools. I attended their graduation service last year and witnessed the joy of some of their students in achieving. I want to acknowledge the work of Principal Chris Brandwood and his staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note with interest in a recent newsletter from Warriappendi that there have been many great examples of students setting goals and taking the steps to achieving them. Well done to those students for taking advantage of a range of opportunities: Michaela McLaughlin-Liddle, for achievement of a school-based traineeship in Certificate III in Business Administration with QANTAS; Shane Weetra, who participated in a tyre-fitting course at the Youth Education Centre and completed three units from the Certificate I in Automotive; and also Shannon Richards, who completed a pre-employment program with Woolworths via a Certificate II Retail and is now employed. These are fantastic outcomes for these students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Still on the topic of Indigenous Australians, last week the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Alan Tudge, visited my electorate and we had a very productive meeting with the Aboriginal Drug and Alcohol Council, an organisation that runs drug and alcohol programs for Indigenous communities. I want to commend Scott Wilson and Jimmy Berry on the good work they do helping thousands of people, mainly Indigenous, with drug and alcohol issues. Whether it be identified in the Forrest review, which I will speak about shortly, or in other discussions with bodies like ADAC, drug and alcohol and school attendance are major challenges for these communities. They are challenges that must be addressed, however, to obtain a better future for Indigenous Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to the bill, it will also provide funding certainty for certain independent special schools and special assistance schools. Since the act was passed by the 43rd Parliament, a number of errors and oversights made during the original drafting have been identified which affect the proper administration of the legislation. This bill will correct these and provide greater certainty for schools about their funding entitlements. Taking action to fix these problems will strengthen the legislative framework that underpins the Australian government's significant investment in schools and contribute to improving the quality of school education in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say a few words about recent visits I have had to schools in my electorate. I recently attended Henley High School in my electorate to congratulate Leon McCalla on being selected to participate in the ConocoPhillips Science Experience program. I am proud to support the program, a great initiative between a major international company and universitiesâalso involving school students. Leon and his science teacher, Tracy Moore, both demonstrated a great passion for science. I enjoyed talking to Leon about his interest in many things, whether it be his science subjects or politics. I was also impressed with Tracy's promotion of science at Henley. I want to congratulate them both on their work and achievements. I look forward to returning to Henley High this Thursday night for their graduation ceremony. It was a great night last year and promises to be a fine night this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While on school services and graduation ceremonies, last Friday I attended St Michael's College. It was wonderful to hear, during the ceremony, of the impressive work students had undertaken across so many areas including community service, leadership and sport. I congratulate all students who received awards, especially Ella Kearsley, the first winner at St Michaels of the Hindmarsh Award, an award I proudly provide to schools in my electorate. St Michael's was also recognised in the world of music as one of 50 schools across Australia to take part in a national music initiative, SongMakers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On education more broadly I want to make a few points about the government's commitment to a number of important reforms. As we all know, funding for higher education is actually going up. In 2013-14, Labor's last budget, the total higher education funding was $8.97 billion; our budget shows higher education funding growing to $9.47 billion by 2017-18. In South Australia, importantly, there is an increase of $275 million over the next four years. This is $275 million more for specific needs, for better teaching resources. For the first time ever the Commonwealth will provide direct financial support for an uncapped number of students studying for higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees. This will include students from low SES backgrounds and from regional Australia and sometimes those from Indigenous communities. The government's reforms will provide better access and more opportunities for low socioeconomic status students and those living in regional Australia. As part of this package, we require universities to invest $1 of every $5 of additional revenue in new Commonwealth scholarships for students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Securing Australia's place at the forefront of research will also be vital. There is money dedicated to those causes, with $150 million in 2015-16 for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, close to $140 million to deliver 100 new four-year research positions per year under the Future Fellowships scheme, $26 million to accelerate research in dementia, $42 million to support new research in tropical disease and $24 million to support the Antarctic gateway partnership. And still on tertiary education, we learnt recently that a number of Australian universities had improved in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times Higher Education</span> world university rankings. This is what we need to hear more of. I want to congratulate the University of Adelaide, which moved from outside the top 200 to 164, and the University of South Australia, which improved as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to return to some challenges and opportunities in education. Whether it be greater school autonomy, more training for teachers or increased parental engagement, there is considerable upside to some of these reforms we are working on. Last week I had the opportunity to meet the principal of Brighton High School. A significant number of Brighton High School's student population are from my electorate. It has a strong reputation for excellence in many areas. It was good to hear the principal's views on the importance of having good leaders across school management. We also agreed on the vital role that parents play in the education of their children. And when meeting with school councilsâwhether it be Underdale high, Star of the Sea, Cowandilla primary school, William Light or the many more I have visited over the last yearâand with parents who are governing council members I have been continually impressed with their passion, interest and commitment to their children's education. This is no different to my children's school, West Beach Primary School, where the members of the governing council are also committed parents who want to see the best for their children's education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The role of parents is discussed in some detail in the Forrest review. I want to quote a couple of paragraphs because I think it is important to the debate we are having now, and the ongoing debate about how to get better education outcomes not just for Indigenous communities but also for all other school communities. Andrew Forrest says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Parents who send their children to school every day accord this fundamental human right to their children. Children who are not sent to school regularly are denied this right, the right to a normal standard of education and the skills to become capable citizens. Without these, they will be unable to enjoy the standard of living of other Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ parents must also play their part and send their children to school at least nine out of 10 school days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember, he is talking about Indigenous communities. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Only wholesale change of community attitude has sufficient potency to create the change which will see every Australian child given a fair go in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whichever way you look at this, only employment will end the disparity, and employment is only possible if we remove all impediments to parity in education.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, he says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It doesnât mean more moneyâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">as we have heard so oftenâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">it does mean we empower our education and training institutions with expectations and the tools to remove the disparity in results between first Australians and other Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are very pertinent words. School funding is naturally important, and I understand the concerns of schools who raise funding certainty with me. I will continue to listen to their views and understand their perspectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, this bill provides necessary funding for specific areas and has a positive benefit for many students. Together with the commitment of parents, teachers and school leaders, we will work together to achieve better education outcomes for our children and our society. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  In mid-August this year I was quite fortunate to visit the remote Northern Territory community of Ntaria, where I volunteered at the local school. I was in Ntaria as a volunteer and a guest of the National Aboriginal Sporting Chance Academyâor NASCAâas part of their role models tour. It was my job to not only help promote and encourage healthy living, education and employment for the young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students but to also experience firsthand the challenge of improving educational standards in remote Aboriginal communities. And what a challenge that is. Over the course of the week that I spent in Ntaria I was fortunate to meet some very special people: the hard-working teachers and staff, whose dedication to Aboriginal education was nothing short of remarkable; the elders and community leaders, striving to give their kids more opportunity through education; and, of course, the wonderfully bright students whose smiles would enliven anyone's day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of my responsibilities that week I was fortunate to sit in on the classes and assist the teachers who were stretched to the limit by some very spirited students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also helped out with the school sports and healthy lifestyle activities. It is wonderful to see these young kids communicating with each other in their native Western Arrernte language. They all speak it and they all understand it, and for many of them it is their first language. Many of the students who come to the Ntaria primary school come without ever having spoken or learnt a word of English so naturally, when they begin school, they struggle with English.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the teachers expressed their frustrations to me and to other members of the party travelling with NASCA. Their frustration was at students making progress with reading or maths who then disappeared from school for weeks, to return once again behind the eight ball. That is the challenge of Indigenous education in remote communities. The challenge of how we best deliver education to remote Indigenous communities is not only momentous but also complexâexceedingly complex. How do we, as a nation, provide these kids with a decent education that offers them all the opportunities other Australian kids are afforded through their education? At the same time, how do we allow them to maintain that very important connection with their land, their heritage and their culture? How do they maintain their connection with their identity and who they are as people?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no easy answer to that question. There is no silver bullet resolution for that. But for me, having experienced this firsthand during my week of volunteering at this school, there is little doubt that a truly needs-based funding model would go a long way to improving the educational outcomes for these kids in remote communities and many more throughout Australia. All the problems with the current system, which have been perfectly highlighted by the Gonski panel, were acutely on display to me during the week that I spent in Ntaria. The teachers were stretched to the limit, often working in classes without trained teachers' aides, and they simply could not devote the necessary time to those kids who were falling behind. As a result, those kids are receiving a substandard educationâa substandard education in Australia, one of the leading economies in the OECD.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor came to government, the results that were coming from certain schools clearly demonstrated this. The literacy and numeracy results from some schools clearly demonstrated that in many areasâparticularly low socioeconomic areas or areas where there is a high Indigenous population, a high population of kids from a non-English-speaking background or a high population of kids with disabilities in schoolsâthey were falling behind and getting substandard educations. In a developed nationâa wealthy nationâlike Australia it is simply not good enough for us to sit on our hands and do nothing about that. That was why the Rudd and Gillard governments instigated and implemented the Gonski process to inquire into the deficiencies in our education system and, more importantly, to recommend a national system for funding schools in this country. They undertook the most comprehensive and thorough investigation of, and consultation on, the issues associated with childhood education in this country. They consulted expertsâthe academics who work in the field. Most importantly, they consulted the people who work at the coalface: the principals; the teachers; indeed, the beneficiaries of education, the students; and those who all want better education results for their kids, the parents. It was the widest consultation on education that had ever been undertaken in this nation's history. It was one of the most comprehensive reports or detailed studies into the deficiencies in our education system and, importantly, a road map for reformâa blueprint for better results in our education system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Gonski panel undertook and that is what the panel unanimously recommended in their report. That is what the Labor government sought to implement. Peter Garrett, as the education minister, undertook an extensive process of consultation with the states, explaining the benefits of the additional funding and signing those states up to the new model for education in this countryâan unprecedented partnership between the Commonwealth and the states to improve student results and outcomes in schools in this country, based on a new funding model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ntaria School's needs, and its teachers' needs, would have been catered forâand should be catered forâunder this model which requires more funding from the states and territories and the Commonwealth. Having seen the deficiencies in the education system in Ntaria, the Abbott government's abandonment of the Gonski funding model and their harsh education cuts in the recent budget may condemn many Indigenous students throughout Australia to continued poor outcomes and a continuation of the tragedy that is Indigenous remote education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remote Indigenous education requires needs-based funding and it requires it now, if we are going to have any chance of reducing the gap when it comes to educational standards. Under the Abbott government, based on research my office has undertaken, in my electorate we are facing the prospect of cuts to the tune of $144 million over the next 10 years to schools in our local area. We face $144 million in cuts to programs such as trade training centres and to support for kids with disabilities, support for Asian languages within schools and support for the funding of years 5 and 6 of the Gonski reforms. It will have an effect on the opportunities that kids have to a good education, to better themselves and to become more productive members of our community. The cuts announced in the government's budget mean that there is no funding for the vital fifth and sixth years of the Gonski reform and restrict indexation to CPI from 2018. With the ABS education price index currently at 5.1 per cent, this is a significant and compounding cut in real terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The real tragedy of the Gonski reforms and the government's refusal to fund them in years 5 and 6 is the fact that over the last four to five years we have undertaken this journey as a nation. As I mentioned earlier, this is the most comprehensive study and detailed analysis of the issues associated with education in this country. It includes reasons for the deficiency and, importantly, how to rectify them. It is not a study that has been undertaken by mugs. It has been chaired by one of the most respected businesspeople in the country. The panel included the likes of Ken Boston AO, who has worked his whole life on education reform, and Kathryn Greiner AO, who is very passionate about education. The members of that panel were unanimous in their recommendations to the government. They put aside partisan political interests and, for once, worked collectively and collegiately on a roadmap for education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government undertook the pain of working with the states on reforming the Australian education system, getting the agreement of some of those states, explaining the benefits to the wider community, and having some of those states allocate that funding in their budget through their forward estimates and beyond: To their credit, the New South Wales Liberal government was one of those. When criticised by Tony Abbott in opposition, they were saying, 'No, Mr Abbott, you are wrong when it comes to this issue.' They stood up for kids education in the state of New South Wales. They did the right thing and they deserve credit for that. But despite all of that good work and the journey that has been undertaken as a nation, the Abbott government says, 'We're only going to fund it for four years and then we're going to go back to the old model.' It does not make any sense at all. It is one of the biggest wastes of resources and time in this country's history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great shame about it is that the victims of this are going to be the kids of the future. The victims of this mean-spirited, short-sighted and insular approach are going to be Australian students. That is what is unconscionable. It is like building an extension on your house and paying all that money for it, having the extension for four to five years and then knocking it down for no apparent reason. It is an ideological obsession with going back to the old model of having the states determine their own futures when it comes to education. That is the great shame of this government's approach to education. We are undermining the good work that is being done and, in so doing, we are undermining the futures of many kids in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On one hand the government claim that money is not the answer, but at the same time they are trying to undo reforms, backed by experts, that will improve student results. One of the impacts of this bill is to delay the implementation of the school improvement plans by one year to January 2016 to facilitate further changes as a consequence of the government's review of command-and-control requirements of school-funding systems. This legislation is designed to make sure that money reaches those students who need it most and that the extra Gonski investment Labor made in our schools actually makes a difference in classrooms. School improvement plans are not about bureaucracy; they are about accountability. It is about ensuring that the money that is spent by the Commonwealth and the states is actually delivering results as intended. It is additional auditing to ensure that the schools are delivering results for students, being delayed by one year by the operation of this bill. The Independent Australian Council for Educational Research has developed a guide for school improvement plans and it has been signed off by the states, Liberal and Labor. We need appropriate levels of oversight to make sure that these reforms do what they are meant to do: help every child in every school improve their results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election the Abbott government declared many things. They declared that they were on a unity ticket with Labor when it came to school education. That promise has been broken. They promised to implement the Gonski loading for students with disabilities in 2015 and provide the additional resources. Instead, they have cut support for students and are delaying the changes that have been universally endorsed for the betterment of Australia's education system. Today's amendments to funding for independent special schools would not be necessary if the government had kept their commitment to introduce the Gonski full disability loading in 2015. This bill is a wasted opportunity. If the government stuck to their election commitment we would not be in this situation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government understands that access to education is the cornerstone of each child's future. Every child has a different vision for what their life will be and a different set of skills, but it is so important that each and every child is given the start that they deserve at a central point of equal access to primary and secondary education.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council's first aim is to improve school attendance and educational attainment. It was agreed in their meeting of February this year that engagement with schooling was a main early focus of the council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Living in remote or very remote communities comes with many challenges, including geographical barriers to school attendance and a pattern of poverty. A report by the Australian National Audit Office found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Limited access to schools is recognised as a primary driver of Indigenous disadvantage in education affecting student attendance, retention rates and academic performance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Prime Minister's recent visit to north-eastern Arnhem Land, the Indigenous Advisory Council met for the fourth time and received a briefing on the Empowered Communities initiative. A key belief of the initiative is that social norms must be established and insisted upon if cycles of impoverishment and disadvantage are to be broken. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first and most emphasised social norms was the imperative nature of school attendance and engagement in training and work. If the key to solving Indigenous disadvantage is access to these opportunities, the government and its allies in Indigenous advancement must be steadfast in delivering Indigenous Australians the very best of training and educational institutions, and persisting with creating these new patterns of engagement. Truancy officers are doing vital work in this area, as the Prime Minister has consistently recognised. But an alternative and complementary initiative is that of boarding in metropolitan areas. The Indigenous boarding initiative is all about creating new cycles and new patterns to really make a difference to Indigenous disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will fund $6.8 million on top of already allocated funds to eligible schools with over 50 Indigenous borders or to schools where 50 per cent or more of the school's borders are Indigenous students from remote or very remote backgrounds. This initiative will allow additional recruitment funding in 2014 to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boarding students at non-government schools. This initiative, which has been legislated into the act as a component of 2014-15 budget, is just one of the measures as part of our Economic Action Strategy to ensure a brighter future for all Australians. The key theme of the action strategy, in partnership with the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, is access to opportunity. Equal opportunity has always been a key coalition value, and is well understood to be the driver for a better life. The coalition believes that lives are transformed by high-quality education. Our society speaks a lot about the cycle of disadvantage. But great educational opportunities produce a new cycle of inspiration, where students who have received the opportunity to have a go and unlock a world of knowledge go on to inspire others from similar backgrounds to do the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, almost 3,000 Indigenous students were enrolled as borders in great schools all around the country. The government is passionate about the best and brightest schools in Australia partnering with Indigenous students in order to grant them the opportunities that they deserve. Some non-government schools, such as The King's School, Parramatta, and Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, have had enormous success in their provision of boarding places to Indigenous students. The government has considered special-purpose boarding facilities and enrolment into boarding initiatives as important contributors to fulfilling key Close the Gap objectives, which were agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in the National Partnership Agreement of 2008. These objectives centre on resolving the disparity in numeracy and literacy outcomes as well as significant gaps in year 12 graduation rates of Indigenous students.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that Mr Warren Mundine has done as chair of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation and as part of the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council has delivered a clear vision in the government's direction for educational advancement. When discussing the resolution to the cycle of Indigenous disadvantage, Mr Mundine said:</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;">â¦ the solution is not a mystery. If marginalised Indigenous children have access to some of Australiaâs best educational opportunities and receive the support they need to pursue meaningful careers then they will enjoy the same quality of life as other Australians with access to these same opportunities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment can be seen as a natural part of our Students First plan, a vision for educational excellence in Australia of which the Minister for Education has been a passionate and effective advocate. The Students First initiative is all about improving teacher quality, increasing school autonomy, engaging parents in education and strengthening the curriculum. These goals for our education system as a whole can be related to the government's aims for Indigenous advancement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we employ great teachers with the skills to engage positively with their students and when they possess the persistence and the drive to encourage hard work in their students, they command respect and attention from each and every student in the classroom. When schools have autonomy, they can effectively tailor their programs to the student and parent bodies, and make sure that those closest to the situation and closest to the students have the strongest say. When parents are engaged in education, families can advance in opportunity together and entire communities can be engaged in better pathways. Finally, when we have a strong curriculum, students can be truly engaged in the comprehensive knowledge which is afforded them by a robust and evenly focused system of understanding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunity to board at a great school in a metropolitan area does not detract from the strong Indigenous identity that Australia's Indigenous students possess. In fact, when students gain a sense of themselves as competent, successful and worthy individuals, they gain an even stronger understanding of themselves in relation to their communities and their Indigenous identity. An alumna of Loreto Normanhurst in North Sydney, Sarah Treacy, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Going to boarding school helped me work harder, focus on my studies and take a genuine interest in myself doing well at school ... Along with this, I gained a stronger pride of being a young Aboriginal woman and I continue to take that pride, maturity and knowledge into my life today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Considering the words of this bright young woman, a proud Indigenous Australian and a proud participant in the educational opportunities afforded to her, I am determined to be a supporter of this and all initiatives to improve access to opportunity for the next generation of Australians. I am certainly proud to be part of a government which believes in Indigenous empowerment and advancement. This bill will ensure that we have a strong legislative framework to achieve these aims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the knowledge that educational opportunity is the key to a brighter future, I am very happy to commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  The very fact that we are here debating the Australian Education Amendment Bill is evidence of this government's absolute deception when it comes to funding for primary and secondary schooling in this country. The government was elected on a promise of no cuts to education and a claim that its policies on school education funding were absolutely identical to Labor's. This bill is evidence that that is simply not true. Here we are today debating a bill which has in fact been made necessary by the Abbott government's broken promises when it comes to our primary and secondary schools. Far from 'honouring' the Gonski agreements, the Abbott government and the education minister have abandoned families, students and teachers across the country, just as they have abandoned patients and public hospitals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister solemnly promised the Australian people that he would not be cutting school education, just as he promised them there would be no cuts to health and no new taxes. Instead, we have seen in this government's first budget a $80 billion cut from schools and hospitals over the next decade, a new tax on visits to the doctors and massive hikes in the cost of getting a university degree. They have abolished all additional funding for the fifth and sixth years of the Gonski reforms. Everybody knows that they were the years of the greatest expansion in funding for primary and secondary schooling. This government are leaving our children and their children's future education behind and, just as it seeks to do with health care, are trying to introduce a more user-pays model, where a decent education depends not on ability or need but on ability to pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are that if the government had kept its promise to deliver the full disability loading in 2015, we would not need to consider amendments to fund independent special schools. Here we are debating this bill which is requiring the funding for independent special schools, something which I support, but we would not need to do this if the government had kept its promise of introducing the full disability loading by 2015. There is no guarantee in this bill that we will ever see the disability loading that was part of the Gonski reforms introduced into primary and secondary schools in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not stand in the way of the measures within this bill that ensure that funding will flow to independent special schools next year. This is an important guarantee to make for those schools. But, again, this change is only necessary because the government have not finalised the loading for students with disability nor provided the funding they promised from 2015. And they have form on not sticking to commitments to students with disabilities, having also failed to extend the $100 million per year in additional support for students with disability transition funding that was in this year's budgetâvery important funding that was providing the opportunity for many schools for the first time to actually work more systematically about how they provide support for students with disability in their schools and how they can actually increase the capacity of their schools to work with children with autism spectrum disorder and other forms of disability right the way through their school system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Education Amendment Bill also provides support for Indigenous students in boarding. This is consistent with our policies when we were in government to construct new boarding schools and to help students from remote communities access boarding school education. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that this bill changes the funding transition rules for independent special schools so their funding is indexed by at least three per cent a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Labor are not opposing this bill because we understand the importance of ensuring that funds reach Indigenous students in boarding schools and that funds reach independent special schools. But much of this bill would not be necessary were it not for the ripping up of the Gonski reforms and the broken promises, which are the hallmark of this government's education policies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the heart of what the Gonski reforms were trying to do. Basically, they were looking at loadings for schools not based on post code, which is the current system the government uses and which is very flawed, and has seen a real discrepancy in the amounts that schools actually get; </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">they were looking at a base unit per student and then looking at loadings. In fact what you would see under the Gonski reforms for schools with higher numbers of Indigenous students, higher numbers of students with disability and higher numbers of kids from economically disadvantaged areas is resources to those schools increasing, regardless of whether they are public schools, independent schools or Catholic schools, or some other form of private school, and funding would depend on the types of students. This is a really fundamental change in the way in which funding goes to our primary and secondary schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The disability loading in particular is critical. I am very concerned that the measures signalled by this bill in essence show that the government has abandoned its attempts to look at disability loading in schools. I know a number of schools have been working hard to measure just what that will mean in their schools, but there are some very serious implications in the way the government has put this bill together, so that they are not going to honour all of the disability loading in all of the years through the Gonski reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing more important than the education of our children and there is nothing more important than how we provide good resources for kids in our schools with disability, particularly in primary schools where kids in their early years of educationâthey are six years of age when they enter primary schoolâhave a huge opportunity to really learn, to be provided with a supportive structure to enable them to get the best they possibly can before they start to experience some of the really awful things that happen to many kids with disabilities. As they fall further and further behind in their schooling, they suffer self-esteem problems, disengagement with school and bullying. A real opportunity is provided if you put money into the early primary years for kids with disabilities, really supporting them with speech pathologists, with social learning and with other aids and equipment. If you do that really early in a kid's schooling, you provide a great opportunity for that young person to not necessarily fall behind but to achieve their full potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that students from disadvantage backgrounds are still slipping further behind and we know that the gap between students will continue to grow if we do not act now to improve our schools. Earlier this year, a report by the Program for International Student Assessment was released which showed that Australia is continuing to go backward, with one of the largest declines in maths among OECD countries since 2000. There are 3.6 million schoolchildren in Australia. Like their parents and their teachers, they expect the government to keep their election promises, but all we have seen from this government is an attempt to pretendâand I have heard many of the speakers on the other sideâthat they are in lock step with the Labor Party's Gonski reforms. We know that is simply not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arrogance of the education minister to blame Australian voters for breaking his promise on schools, the arrogance of the education minister and the Prime Minister to wash their hands of responsibility from the Commonwealth for funding schools and improving school education is, frankly, a disgrace. During the election campaign last year, on 29 August, the member for Sturt said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">You can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your schoolâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">to the dollar. The opposition play this tricky little game: because two states had yet to sign up to agreements that somehow or other the money was not provided is simply a lie. This continued myth that the government is trying to go on with is all spin. Parents know absolutely that millions and millions of dollars are being cut out of every primary school and every single secondary school in this country by this government. Go to any primary school in any electorate in this country and stare them in the face and say, 'You are getting extra, exactly the amount Labor promised you.' If any member of the government says that, it will simply not be true. We know that the promise the member for Sturt made during the election campaign was absolute nonsense and given the haste with which they tore up that promise, it was in fact a deliberate deception. Schools have been abandoned and schools' interests are not being held in the highest regard by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gonski reforms would have made a real and practical difference to schools in regional and rural areas like my electorate of Ballarat. It is the out years, the fifth and sixth years of funding that are of critical importance and that is the funding this government has cut. Last year Elise Whetter, who is a school council president in my electorate, wrote a letter to Victorian Premier Denise Napthine calling on him to sign up to the Gonski reforms:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At my son's primary school, we have seen real improvements in literacy, numeracy and wellbeing from our existing National Partnership agreement That said, we should look beyond simply meeting basic literacy and numeracy standards, and expect that every child enjoys the opportunity to not only meet their potential, but excel. There should be absolutely no difference in our expectations for the kind of education our children receive, regardless of whether they attend a State or independent school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will be the majority of students in State Schools who will be further disadvantaged, many of whom have already been impacted upon by the significant cuts to education made by your governmentâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">By failing to sign, you will be telling State School children that their education and outlook for the future is of lesser value than their peers at independent schools. This would be an appalling position for a State Government to take.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why then are this Prime Minister and the education minister abandoning the Gonski reforms? No amount of spin about which money was where, on which budget line item and how that all works can deny the fact that the government has cut the funding where the increases in the Gonski reforms were. That it has not committed more funding for disability loading in the transition. This bill is absolutely evident of it. Why is the government not listening to the families, to the teachers and to the students when it comes to the funding of our schools?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students across all schools, whether they are state, Catholic or independent, all deserve a world-class education system. Teachers deserve to be able to access the resources that they need to teach to the various abilities of the kids they have before them whether they are starting from behind the eight ball because of the geographic location where they are born, entrenched disadvantage in Indigenous communities or disability. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Teachers should have the resources they need to be able to teach kids of varying abilities, and that is what Gonski was all about. It is a damning indictment on this government that they have not only abandoned Gonski but then tried to pretend somehow that they have kept their election commitments on this matter. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children do not choose what socioeconomic background they come from. These cuts hurt students, they hurt parents, they hurt the teachers and they hurt communities right across Australia. We can ease the struggle for many families, students and teachers by providing them with the tools to excel, develop and lift them out of poverty. We do not do that by cutting school funding. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly do not do that by cutting and not making guarantees to commit to the disability loading in Gonski. We do not do that by cutting $128 million from youth education and employment programs, leaving future generations of students without the critical resources of the national Job Guide to assist with selecting subjects for years 10, 11, and 12 to develop a path to employment. We do not it by cutting funding to TAFE and cutting funding to universities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are sent to this place to ensure that future generations inherit a more prosperous, safer and healthier Australia. How can we leave them an education system where the gap between the rich and poor gets even bigger? As a nation we cannot afford to leave our children behind and we are doing that by cutting funding to schools. What this government is saying to students and to our children is that they do not value their education. They are saying that they do not care whether the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged schools gets bigger. They do not care whether the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, students with a disability or students from a low socioeconomic background continues to get bigger: 'We are not going to resource your school to help teach those students.' </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a once-in-a-generation chance to make sure our students, classrooms and teachers are resourced properly for the future, but this government is choosing a path that leaves students more disadvantaged and without the proper support they need. They are abandoning the students of Australia and they will be condemned for it. </span>

                    <a href="M3A" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise today to support the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2014. This bill amends the Australian Education Act 2013, which was rushed through by the former government and consequently suffered from a lack of forward thinking that education deserves and needs.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just briefly, before I go into more detail on a few of these amendments, this bill establishes and funds the Indigenous Boarding Initiative; ensures continued transition arrangements for special schools and special assistance schools to avoid a reduction in funding from 2015; extends the commencement of school improvement planning requirements; ensures schools moving between approved authorities will neither be financially advantaged nor disadvantaged; ensures the Commonwealth pays only its share of the total public funding entitlement; corrects the location loading that applies to major city schools; amends a cross-reference regarding pro rata of recurrent funding; clarifies the operation of reviewable decisions; corrects the 2014 amount for capital funding payable to block grant authorities; and allows the minister to take action under this act where a school has failed to comply with requirements under the former Schools Assistance Act 2008. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, this is a very comprehensive bill and credit must be given to the hardworking and passionate Minister for Education. I know of his passion for achieving educational outcomes for all sectors of our community and I am pleased to see so many positive ideas put into action by this him. Particularly, after the mess left by the former government, I know people in the education sector are relieved that this government is approaching the sector and issues faced by it in a calm, considered and responsible manner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing in my opinion is more serious than the education of our children. It is education that will equip our youth with the skills and abilities necessary to compete against a future workforce from across the globe. I have always believed that education is the forward for all individuals but, in particular, for Aboriginal people, it is the way that we can reduce disparity across entire communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I often quote Nelson Mandela when I talk about education and I want to do so again, because these words are truer today than ever before:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the worldâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and if we provide the opportunities for children, we enable them to be part of a decision-making process that gives them increased choices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without education, your children can never really meet the challenges they will face. So it's very important to give children education and explain that they should play a role for their country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farmworkers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are particularly sage words given the debate on this bill currently before the House. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the positive initiatives in this bill is the establishment of the Indigenous Boarding Initiative. This initiative will provide $6.8 million in additional funding in 2014 to eligible non-government schools to assist them in the provision of the essential services and support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boarding students. There are 21 eligible non-government boarding schools across the Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Hasluck, one of those eligible schools is La Salle College in Viveash. La Salle College has developed a strong and productive relationship with the remote community of Balgo. Through this relationship, La Salle College offers boarding places for Aboriginal students from Balgo at the Swanleigh Hostelâthe same hostel that I stayed in when I was given a scholarship to attend secondary school in Perth. In many ways, La Salle is recreating today the journey through education that I had many, many years ago. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few years ago Swanleigh Hostel closed down, and it was great to have a school from the Hasluck electorate turn it back into a boarding hostel for young Aboriginal students. On many occasions I have visited the students from Balgo at school and at Swanleigh, and it has brought back many memories of my time there. That is why I am pleased to support this bill. By supporting this bill I am supporting students just like meâstudents who could one day be standing in my shoes in this great House through the support given by schools such as La Salle College and the support given through policies such as the Indigenous Boarding Initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other eligible schools in Western Australia include the Christian Aboriginal Parent Directed School, Karalundi Aboriginal Education Community, Wongutha Christian Aboriginal Parent-Directed School, the Yiramalay/Wesley Studio School and Clontarf Aboriginal College. I have visited Clontarf on a number of occasions and have had the privilege of meeting students from the Yiramalay/Wesley Studio School at a recent public hearing in Halls Creek for the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. I can confidently say that this bill is supporting great educational outcomes and opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting that those opposite make these false statements about so-called cuts to education and that they are the best friends of education. As I have said previously, I have been around long enough to know the history of the establishment in 1972 of the Aboriginal Secondary Grants, or ABSEG, and Abstudyâboth program initiatives that enabled Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to attend school, to attend boarding schools and to progress their education from the communities in which they lived. Over time, those programs have diminished under Labor governmentsâto the point where those opportunities that once prevailed do not exist in the same way that they did. They were a great opportunity to enable parents and communities to encourage their children to go on and take pathways into the tertiary sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite are sometimes the worst friend that education can have, particularly in terms of Aboriginal students. I remind those opposite that it was under the Keating government that education spending on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education was cut significantly. Dawkins, Keating and Labor ripped away the opportunities for hundreds of Aboriginal students across the nation. As long as I am in this chamber, I will never let those opposite forget their legacy. I was on a number of national committees and we met with the relevant education ministers at various times only to be told that programs would be reduced or would cease and, in that period of legacy, we watched programs dissipate and opportunities being taken away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are on legacies, I remind those opposite that the only reason we have this bill before the House today is that they botched the original legislation. They rushed the legislation through the parliament and, truly, the number of errors and omissions in the original preparation of the legislation was astounding. It actually undermined the intended operation of the act and created funding and regulatory uncertainty for schools. I wonder what those opposite were thinking when they saw the bill. I am sure there must be number of teachers on the other side of the House. By simply giving them the legislation they could have gotten out their red pen and underlined the errors and circled the omissions. No doubt, if they were grading the then minister on the first draft of the bill which is currently enshrined in law, they would have given them an F and would have circled in red pen what they thought were the omissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn the attention of the House back to the bill at hand. As mentioned before, this bill will ensure that certain special schools or special assistance schools will not have their funding reduced in 2015âsomething that those opposite would have let happen. Without these amendments, the safety net in place will disappear and these schools, which provide a valuable educational service, will have their funding immediately reduced from 1 January 2015. We on this side of the House will not let that happen. This bill will also ensure that schools moving between approved authorities will neither be financially advantaged nor disadvantaged. This is important to ensure that schools do not change their approved authority status solely for funding reasons. It also means that every school will have the flexibility to vary its transition pathway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good bill and good amendments. If we are serious about bringing in changes that address the needs of not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island children but also children in country and rural regions whose economic circumstances are problematic, we need a much better way of starting to think about how we address their educational needsâand this bill encourages that. The last thing we need in this nation is a gap between those who have had the opportunity of traversing the pathways of education to higher education and acquiring jobs that lead them into a life of reasonable wealth and also opportunities to be who they want to be and aspire to as opposed to those who do not get that opportunityâwho, not only through disadvantage of their own making but also through government policy, do not access the relevant opportunities that are provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know of many non-government schools and government schools that have formed partnerships with Aboriginal and remote communities with a view to encouraging students to access the options that they provide for any student who is enrolled within the academic or vocational education pathways. What is even more rewarding is watching areas of the south-west of my own state where people are now looking at how we can provide opportunities. One of the factors that inhibits them is the opportunity to access funding. If they are boarding facilitiesâwhich many of the non-government schools provideâthis is an opportunity to enter into partnerships with significant Aboriginal communities that enable students to be identified and encouraged to seek a pathway into a career of their aspiration and then for those levels of support within an urban context to be provided by those schools that are participating in encouraging the development of skills. I support this bill, and I certainly am encouraged by the minister in his thinking about wanting to address many aspects of education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last government made commitments to funding education that they had not fully budgeted for nor had the capacity to fund. When governments make these sorts of commitments, it creates expectations within a community that are unreasonable and unfair. When we talk about an opportunity under a particular strategy there is an expectation that the flow-on implementation will see results deliveredânot only in funding but also in the types of programs and support services that prevail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been a classroom teacher, I know the value of the support that can come with additional staff, but by the same token I know that when you are in a school you make budgetary choices and you live within your means. Sometimes governments do not do that, and certainly the Gillard government did not do that in the context of education. Had it thought about what it could deliver tangibly and realistically without sending the economy into incredible debt, then those broad commitments and the financial arrangements entered into with each individual state and territory would not have occurred in the way that they did. Even in the allocation of funding there was a disparity between what WA received and what the bigger states received, because one system does a job well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line for all of us should be the educational pathway outcomes for any student who attends any sector where schooling is provided. That is the more important factorâskilling and creating the pathways of opportunity for our young and upcoming future generations of Australians who will require the skills in a global society and economy and also within a country that will position itself to be a key leader in many facets of industry and within the education and higher-education sector. I look forward to speaking with the principal of La Salle College about how the Indigenous boarding initiative will benefit his students, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill, following the member for Hasluck. It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Hasluck, who is particularly learned and wise on education matters concerning Indigenous children. This bill does a number of things, and I would like to speak briefly on the subject matter of the bill, then speak more broadly on Indigenous education and some of the initiatives which the government is doing and some of the challenges we as a nation face. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself allows payment of additional funding in 2014 to schools with large numbers of Indigenous boarding students from remote areas in order to meet an identified resources shortfall. The Indigenous boarding initiative was announced through the 2014-15 budget, and will provide $6.8 million in additional funding to eligible schools. The regulations will determine the school's eligibility and the amount of funding it will receive under the initiative. This bill will prevent funding cuts to students with disabilities and to other students in some independent special schools and special-assistance schools that would otherwise occur from 1 January 2015 by ensuring transitional funding arrangements for these schools are consistent with other schools under the act. The bill also addresses a number of errors and omissions that occurred during the original preparation of the act under the former government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important bill in and of itself in terms of providing additional support for Indigenous students to be able to attend boarding facilities, and that is something we strongly support on this side of the chamber. We strongly support Indigenous families having the choice for their children to be able to attend boarding schools, particularly in areas where there simply is not the alternative of having a good local school to year 12 where they reside, and therefore boarding schools realistically become the only option. To that end, I commend the work of Andrew Penfold and the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation. It is something that we strongly support, a number of companies support and, indeed, the broader community supports very strongly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to sum up on this bill as I go, but before doing so I will make a couple of points more broadly about our Indigenous education initiatives. We often use the word 'crisis' in this House in referring to a whole raft of issues, but a real crisis is occurring today in relation to the poor outcomes that many Indigenous students are achieving. I have met people who have left school, supposedly having been there for 10 years, yet who could barely write their names or read a sentence. When you look at the statistics you see that in a place like Queensland by the time remote students are in year 9 they are about six years behind everybody else. Across the board they are doing more poorly than othersâand this is the crisis, because we know that if these students are not learning then their prospects of getting a good job at the end are so much more diminished. We have to take action in this regard. Collectively as a nation we must take action, and we must prioritise this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are certainly prioritising under the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs as a No. 1 starting point that the kids are at school. Nobody can learn if they are not at schoolâit is a necessary pre-condition for learning. It sounds very straightforward, but when you look at the data, you find that in remote communities students are attending about 60 per cent of the time. This does not mean the students learn 60 per cent of the content; rather, you need to be attending about 80 per cent of the time to be learning anything at all. If you are attending less than 80 per cent of the time then the curriculum will advance too far in front of you and you will end up learning very little at all. So 80 per cent is the absolute bare-minimum benchmark for school attendance. It should be 100 per cent, but 80 per cent is the bare minimum. In the Northern Territory only one-quarter of children are attending school 80 per cent of the time, which means that only one-quarter of those children are attending often enough to learn effectively. That is a crisis, which we must address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already started a number of initiatives, perhaps the most important being the Remote School Attendance Strategy, which is now operating in 73 schoolsâthose schools which had the poorest attendance records. This strategy pays for local people to be employed to literally be student attendance officers, to knock on people's doors, to drive a minibus where required and to pick up the local kids and take them to the local schoolâa very simple, practical on-the-ground initiative involving local people. That, to date, has been working very well. On average, we have had a five percentage point improvement in student attendance, but in some places there has been a 15 percentage point improvement already, which is a remarkable achievement. So we are strongly supporting that and want to see it further evolve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also strongly support the Clontarf Foundation, which uses football as a mechanism for engaging, particularly, teenage boys at secondary school. I know the former Labor government also strongly supported Clontarf, but in the most recent budget we gave a further $13 million to allow these Clontarf academies to be rolled out further across Australia as a mechanism to engage the children, keep them at school and progress them into work. But we need to do more, because even in places such as Yirrkala, in East Arnhem Landâwhere the Prime Minister visited recently, and a number of ministers and I were there with himâthe school has student attendance officers and a Clontarf Academy in place and yet the school attendance rate is still only 55 per cent. Despite all of that effort, the student attendance rate is still so poor, and more needs to be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Forrest, in his report, has advised us to make this an absolute national priority, where the pressure must be on every institution to lift student attendance overall. That means the pressure needs to be on the state governments, who run the schools. He recommends that the Commonwealth should be paying state governments on the basis of school attendance rather than student enrolment, which would be a fundamental difference and put the heat on the state and territory governments. He also recommends that there needs to be more pressure on the parents and, where they are receiving family tax benefits to help them look after their children, a basic precondition for those family tax benefits should be that the parent is sending their child to school. He also recommends that distractions be eliminated. A distraction could be a football carnival or a big show which goes on during the school day which consequently means that the kids might not go to school. We are seriously considering all of those big recommendations Mr Forrest has given to us, because we must get on top of the students' attendance problem. If we do not, the kids will not learn, and if they are not learning then it is almost inevitable that they will end up on the welfare queue and, in many cases, in prison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is our starting point. It is not the ending point, but it is the starting point. Kids must be at school. Once they are at school, we then have to ensure that there is good instruction and there are good teachers. There are a number of things that Andrew Forrest, again, has recommended to us which we are taking a very close look at, but just one initiative which I will emphasise is the Good to Great Schools initiative, where we are providing $22 million for the rollout of effective, explicit instruction in remote schools. That is being trialled in Cape York, where it has been rolled out in five schools and has had incredible results. In fact, the Cape York academy schools have been found by Professor John Hattie to be schools where students learn at 1.5 times the learning rate of similar students in reading and numeracy. In the NAPLAN results which we got just recently, there was a whole year class of students in a Cape York academy school where 100 per cent of students reached national minimum benchmarks in reading and numeracy and almost 100 per cent reached the spelling benchmark. As many people would know, that is a fantastic achievement. If we could replicate that across Australia in remote schools then we would have broken the back of the education crisis which is in many remote schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been asked to sum up this bill. I would like to thank all of the speakers on the Australian Education Amendment Bill for their contributions to the debate. The coalition government is committed to supporting the delivery of quality schooling and to providing funding and regulatory certainty for all Australian schools. We are committed to making sure every Australian child has the opportunity to reach their potential, through a great education. In government, we have invested a record $64.5 billion over four years in schooling. This includes the $1.2 billion this government restored for schools in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory when we came to office in 2013, money that the former Labor government did not place into the budget. We were very clear in the lead-up to the 2013 federal election, including in our Students First policy, that we would maintain the funding arrangements enacted by the 43rd Parliament for the four years of the forward estimates. We have kept that commitment and indeed we have done more. We have added an additional $1.2 billion that the previous government ripped out of schools in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment bill enables additional targeted support for schools so that we can provide much-needed services to support Indigenous boarding school students. I outlined those earlier. In the Students First policy that we took to the 2013 election, we promised to end the command-and-control aspects of the Australian Education Act, to remove those parts of the act that allowed the federal government to dictate what states and territories must do in their schools and to ensure that the states and territories remain responsible for schools and that non-government schools maintain their independence and autonomy. The minister plans to introduce amendments to the act in 2015 to address the command-and-control features of the act. While the government negotiates with states and territories and the non-government school sector on the command-and-control aspects of the act, the bill amends the Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2013 to extend to 1 January 2016, or a later date determined by the minister by legislative instrument, the commencement of school improvement planning requirements under the act. This is to provide regulatory certainty to schools whilst consultations with stakeholders occur in relation to possible adjustments to this requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides additional funding support for remote Indigenous students, prevents funding reductions for schools catering to students with a disability, delivers regulatory certainty and improves the overall operation of the act. Taking action to address these will strengthen the legislative framework that underpins the Australian government's significant investment in schools and contributes to improving the quality of school education in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the minister I thank all of the speakers who have contributed to this bill. I again emphasise the government's commitment to schooling, to ensuring that every single student has the opportunity for a great education in primary and secondary school. I again emphasise the record levels of funding which this government is providing. This year alone we are increasing funding by eight percentage points. Next year we will increase by eight per cent. The year after, we will increase the funding by a further eight per cent, and the year after thatâthe final year of the forward estimatesâa further six per cent. Included in that funding is the $1.2 billion that the Labor government ripped out of those schools in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. I think it is a great shame that they did that, and I am certainly very proud as a member of the coalition government that we were able to put that money back into those schools and states. I know that those state governments, parents and students from those states particularly appreciate the fact that this government was willing to stand up and replace the $1.2 billion which the Labor government ripped out. It was an important measure we took when we first came to government and it is one we are very proud of. I commend the bill and thank all the speakers in this debate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I rise to speak on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and note that this is the first time this bill has been debated for second reading since the minister's second reading speech on 26 March, which is quite some time agoâwell before the budget. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008 to waive debts for dentists under the former Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, which was closed in 2012. It will also make a number of amendments for the operation of Labor's Child Dental Benefits Schedule to bring the compliance framework of the scheme into greater alignment with Medicare's compliance framework. This bill amends both acts so that the Professional Services Review scheme can be applied to any dental services provided under the Child Dental Benefits Schedule so that suspected cases of inappropriate practice can be investigated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Dental Benefits Act to enable the chief executive of Medicare and relevant employees of the Department of Human Services to obtain documentation from a dentist to substantiate the payment benefits under the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Finally, the bill makes a number of machinery amendments to both the Dental Benefits Act and the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. I will say at the outset that Labor will not be opposing this bill but I will have a second reading amendment on the bill as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the contents of this bill are of themselves not too contentious, the remarks of the minister when he introduced it are of great concern to Labor, especially in relation to the concern that he flagged at the end of his second reading speech about the operation of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. This is a government that, frankly, came to power promising no cuts to health and no new taxes and then, when elected promptly set about smashing public hospital funding and announcing a new tax on visits to the doctor. When a minister has not been up-front before the election about how he planned to rip $50 billion out of public hospitals and slug patients with a tax every time they visit a doctor or attend an appointment for a scan, I think we have some very strong grounds to be deeply concerned when this same minister flags his so-called 'concerns' with another scheme that he supported in opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth discussing here a little of the history of Commonwealth funding for dental schemes, which we are debating here today. The great missing link in public health in Australia has been in dental care. It was left out of Medicare back in 1984 reputedly because of both cost and the politics of having to tackle both doctors and dentists at the same time, which was considered a bridge too far. This is especially so when one recalls that the Liberal Party was then, as it always has been, implacably opposed to Australians having access to decent, affordable health care regardless of incomeâa battle we are fighting again today over the GP tax. It is good to know your history when it comes to these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has to fight two elections, a double dissolution and a historic joint sitting of parliament to introduce universal health care in Australia with Medibank only to see it promptly torn down by the Liberals after 1975. In 1983 we were elected again on a promise of introducing universal health care and, despite ferocious opposition, again from the Liberals, succeeded in introducing Medicare in 1984. The Liberals promised after every election that they were going to tear it down, and they finally learnt their lesson in 1996, when John Howard promised, if elected, to retain Medicare despite having once called it 'the greatest disaster ever to befall the health system'. It is important to know your history when it comes to these matters. I know some on the opposite side are parroting the same lines, they are staying on message, but this is your history. The history of the Liberal-National Party is to get rid of Medicare, and now you are just trying to do it by stealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Labor has had to fight the Liberals every step of the way to introduce Medicare and to protect it from those who have thought decent health care should only be available to those who can afford it. Throughout that period we have sought to improve and extend Medicare. Previously when we are in government we did have a Commonwealth Dental Scheme, a very important scheme that was actually seeing public waiting lists in dental going down. What was John Howard's first act when he came into this parliament as Prime Minister? He got rid of that scheme and introduced a very limited scheme that then blew out. It was very limited scheme that was never designed to do what it was ending up doing back in 2012. It is important to know your history when it comes to dental health and when it comes to Commonwealth funding for dental health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Labor government was able in 2012 to provide the most significant Commonwealth investment in dental care since Federation. There has never been any logical reason for why health care should stop at our teeth and why Australia should care about every part of the health of a person's body, apart from what is in their mouth. The abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Scheme by John Howard was, frankly, something that saw public dental lists blow out in this country. He was responsible for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that dental care is, of course, not just about teeth, but poor dental care is a good determinant of poor general health care; that poor dental care is linked to chronic disease; and that if teeth are not properly cared for poor dental care too often leads to much greater health problems. So it was with some pride that as a member of the former Labor government I was involved in the steps we took to advance our universal system of health care to dental care with the announcement of a $4.1 billion Dental Reform Package. As far reaching as this was, it still the not fully extended to dental care the same level of support that Medicare provides for just about every other area of health care. As always, the budget had to be taken into account. We had to ensure that the steps we talk to extend Medicare to dentistry could be afforded and, indeed, justified against the competing demands of so many other worthy areas of health. So we targeted the areas of dental care that were most likely to deliver the greatest return of that investment and was most deserving of funding. In other words, children and low-income earners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $4.1 billion Dental Reform Package we announced back in 2012 comprised $2.7 billion for around 3.4 million Australian children who will be eligible for subsidised dental care. Ours was 'Helping kids to grow up smiling'; the government has now changed it to the Child Dental Benefits Scheme. There was $1.3 billion for around 1.4 million additional services for adults on low incomes to have better access to dental care through the public dental system; and $225 million for dental capital and workforce was to be provided to support expanded services for people living in outer metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas. The centrepiece, of course, was the Child Dental Benefits Schedule, which commenced on 1 January this yearâthe program that meant that for over 3 million children aged two to 17, going to the dentist now has become like going to see the GP. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We introduced the scheme because of disturbing evidence that the oral health of children has been declining since the mid 1990s. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in 2009 the proportion of children who had experienced decay in their baby or deciduous teeth ranged from 42 per cent of five-year-olds to 61 per cent of nine-year-olds. The proportion of children with permanent teeth affected by decay ranged from five per cent for six-year-olds to 58 per cent for 14-year-olds. That is a damning indictment on what was happening in dental for children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 20,000 kids under the age of 10 are hospitalised each year due to avoidable dental issues. By age 15 six out of 10 kids have tooth decay. So the scheme sought to tackle that by providing a capped benefit of $1,000 per child over a two calendar year period targeted at low- and middle-income families by tying eligibility to those receiving family tax benefit part A or an equivalent Australian government paymentâtrying to put money where it was most needed: preventative health of children's dental and for low- and middle-income earners. The program is a crucial investment in the long term health of children, because we know that dental health in children is the best predictor of dental health as adults but also a predictor of overall health. In just the first two months of this scheme's operation, more than 84,000 children have received dental treatment under the Child Dental Benefits Scheme, and that includes some 26,000 children outside of major cities. As those figures show, it is a scheme that has been desperately needed, and Labor was very proud to deliver it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to dental for children, the Dental Reform Package provided extra funding for 1.4 million additional services for adults on low incomes, including pensioners and concession card holders and those with special needs to have better access to dental health care through the public dental system. It also meant more services and more dentists in areas of most needâoutside capital cities and large regional centres where, again, we know there are higher rates of poor dental health and chronic illness. Again here the funding was driven by the evidence about who was most in need of government support. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, while untreated decay and fillings are similar across income ranges, if you earn more than $60,000 a year you have on average seven more teeth than those earning less than $20,000 per year. That is, again, pretty damning statistic and evidence that, sadly, in Australia, while we have a health system that guarantees first-class care for people who have an accident or get cancer or heart disease, the state of a person's teeth are still a very good determinant of income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this package was in addition to the $515 million announced in the 2012-13 budget, which included a blitz on public dental waiting lists. In the 2013 calendar year, over 20,000 public dental patients received treatment because of Labor's funding of the public dental waiting list blitz. It is because of Labor that over 280,000 adults and children have better oral health now resulting from free or subsidised care under our Dental Reform Package. And just as it was only Labor that introduced or defended Medicare, so it is only Labor that would advance Medicare to improve the health of all Australians. And just as this government seeks to tear down Medicare, so it is, we suspect, with Labor's dental health programs. Whereas Labor sought to extend and improve the health services available to all Australians, the Liberals demonstrate that time and time again they see decent health care as something that should only be available to those who can afford to pay. Indeed, in introducing this bill, the Minister for Health told this parliament:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I put on the record some early concerns about the way in which the Child Dental Benefits Schedule was structured â¦ we will continue to monitor that program very carefully because I do have some concerns about the way in which this scheme was designed â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truly bizarre thing about this is that this scheme, although conceived, announced and funded by a Labor government, actually commenced its operation under the Abbott government in January this year. The Minister for Health, if he had concerns about the scheme's structure or its design, had the opportunity to amend it prior to its commencement in January. But he waited until March to drop his concerns into the back of a speech, making a series of technical amendments to the child dental benefits scheme and amendments to the issues around debts for dentists following the abolition of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. He drops it in at the tail end of a speech. So despite not opposing the scheme in opposition and then actually presiding over its introductionâbeing in government for several months, having the opportunity, having representations from dental associations across the country about the schemeâit seems the minister is already planning to make changes to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule for millions of kids. When a minister who promised no cuts to hospitals and then slashes $50 billion from hospitals says that he has concerns about the child dental health scheme, the warning lights are flashing bright red and the sirens are sounding even louder as to what they are intending to do with this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has all the hallmarks of yet another example of the Abbott government laying the groundwork for cuts and destroying universal health care in Australia. They are pulling the same trick that they did with their new GP tax and Australian families should not fall for it. They can see the evidence about this government's commitment to dental health right before their eyes in the budget. Before the election the Prime Minister, as the then opposition leader, declared in January 2013 that there was an aspiration to extend Medicare to cover dentistry. Fitting with this government's dedication to saying one thing to get elected and doing an entirely different thing in government, rather than extending Medicare to dentistry, they instead slashed the commitment of the Commonwealth to fund dental care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In just its first few months in office we saw the Abbott government reverse the proposed expansion of the Voluntary Dental Graduate Year Program, cutting $40 million. The budget itself saw nothing but cuts to dental programs: $229 million was cut from the dental infrastructure scheme for rural, regional and outer metropolitan areasâthe scheme that was designed to provide more dental chairs for public patients across the country, more capacity for clinical training places for dentists across the country; another $15 million was cut from Charles Sturt University's program to establish dental clinics on the New South Wales Central Coast; and $390 million has been cut by putting on hold a program for the states to shorten adult dental waiting lists by delaying the second national partnership agreement with the states, with no guarantee that money will ever be returned into the public dental system down the track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first two cuts show the contempt this government has for the people in rural and regional Australia, and, frankly, the complete inability of the National Party to stand up for its constituents against a Liberal health minister determined to slash and burn health, particularly in the regions. Rural and regional Australia only has about half as many dentists per capita as metropolitan areas, and these programs, while not fixing that overnight, would have gone some way towards improving the number of dentists practicing outside our capital cities. Indeed, just this month I attended, with the Assistant Minister for Health, the opening in my electorate of a new student accommodation facility designed to help universities train medical students locally, giving them a taste of living and working in regional Victoria. As the minister then correctly noted, the investment, which came from the former Labor government, ensures more medical students not only live and train in regional Victoria, but those who do have that experience are much more likely to want to practice in those areas when their training is complete. Knowing that, this government still cut those programs to the detriment of people in rural and regional areas who are in desperate need of more dentists and better dental care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deferment of the national partnership agreement means hundreds of thousands of people with poor dental health, many of them in constant pain, will continue to wait for treatment. An estimated 400,000 people are on dental waiting lists around the country, and in some states that program has helped to cut waiting lists by up to half. As Griffith University Professor of Dental Research Newell Johnson told the ABC, these cuts will be a disaster for dental health and could double or treble waiting lists. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Then the waiting lists are going to grow and you are going to have people sitting there in pain once again â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Melanie Hayes, National President of the Dental Hygienists' Association of Australia, correctly nailed this as the Abbott government abandoning 'continued investment in preventive oral health, demonstrating contempt for those Australians who rely on public dental services'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And already we see these cuts have had an impact on real people. The budget cuts have now placed in doubt the work of the community dental programs operating out of a clinic in Light Square in central Adelaide. The Light Square clinic was set up with government grants, support from the Australian Dental Research Foundation and significant donations from medical companies; it gives free care to a range of people otherwise unable to afford a dentist. It is also an important training ground for final year Adelaide dental students and provides simple restorative work like fillings as well as extractions, cleaning and preventive care. But its funding will wind up at the end of the year, possibly leaving only donations as a funding source. The clinic is working on strategies to see how it can keep going, but it has made it clear the loss of federal government funding means it will be treating many fewer patients with no guarantees of how long the organisation can survive. And that is a pattern that will be repeated right the way across the country for hundreds of thousands of Australians unable to find the money for dental care, many of them waiting years for public clinics to treat them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that is the record of this government when it comes to dental health: it is as mean and deceitful as it has been in all other areas of health. It is no surprise then that these bills are not about improving dental health, but are, instead, simply technical bills designed to pick up a number of issues with various dental programs, including some long gone, such as the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, which Labor closed in 2012. This scheme was poorly targeted and was failing to address the problems in the existing dental scheme such as public dental waiting lists, infrastructure, workforce distribution and of course the appalling state of children's dental health in Australia. The scheme did not deal with those issues and we believe very strongly that the money for the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme would be better targeted at hitting those areas: children's dental health and poor and middle-income Australians who are reliant on public dental schemes. That money was better spent in that area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Human Services conducted audits of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and found that there was a high rate of noncompliance with the provider-reporting requirements set out in section 10(2) of the determination. Debts were raised against dentists found to be noncompliant through the audit process.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms KING:</span>
                    </a>  The same government department bureaucrats who engaged in that so-called 'witch-hunt' are actually here, so you might want to be a bit more respectful of those people. Further, more than 20 per cent of recipients were not pensioners or concession card holders, and more than 20 per cent of spending was on high-cost restorative services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following representations from the Australian Dental Association and other groups, which outlined that dentists had not been aware of their obligations until April 2010, the government has decided that debts due to the Commonwealth solely as a result of noncompliance with section 10(2) before this time should be waived. Labor supports that approach. The government has further decided that debts due solely to noncompliance after April 2010 should be waived as long as the dentist can demonstrate an intention to comply with their obligations. Labor, again, supports that approach. The minister describes this as 'dentists who did nothing more than make minor paperwork errors and who have been waiting for way too long for adequate resolution.' It is worth noting that debt waivers are already proceeding under section 34 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997; however, the government thinks this is a slow and unwieldy process that requires unnecessary administration and processing in both the Department of Human Services and the Department of Finance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some dentists have already paid debts to the Commonwealth that fall under this waiver, and this bill provides for those amounts to be repaid to the dentist. Again, we support that. Labor takes very seriously the issue of inappropriate professional behaviour and supports the application of compliance powers as well as the operation of the Professional Services Review scheme. We will not be opposing this section of the bill, but we note the minister's assurance that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small"> â¦ this amendment will not excuse those dentistsâa small numberâwho did not comply with other legal requirements of the scheme or, in particular, who committed fraud. Only those dentists who provided services in good faith will be eligible to have their debt waived.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is as it should be. The bill also amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008 to introduce what the minister describes as 'critical changes for the efficient operation of the child dental benefits scheme.' These changes bring the compliance framework for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule into greater alignment with Medicare's compliance framework and include the power to compel a provider to comply with a request to produce documents to substantiate the payment of benefits. This is aimed at ensuring this scheme is targeted at those it was intended forâthe low- and middle-income earners who qualify for family tax benefit part A or similar payments. This bill amends both acts so that the Professional Services Review scheme can be applied to any dental services provided under the child dental benefits scheme so that suspected cases of inappropriate practice can be investigated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Professional Service Review is an independent authority which has operated under the Health Insurance Act since 1994 to examine suspected cases of inappropriate practice under Medicare referred by the Department of Human Services. Dentists providing services under the MBS are covered by the Professional Service Review and it would be appropriate that dentists providing services that attract a benefit under the Dental Benefits Act are also covered by the PSR scheme. This bill also enables the Chief Executive Medicare and relevant employees of the Department of Human Services to obtain documentation from a dentist to substantiate the payment benefits under the child dental benefits scheme. Again, as these changes appear to be designed to reinforce Labor's intent when we introduced the scheme, Labor will not be opposing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill makes a number of technical amendments to the Dental Benefits Act, including: clarifying provisions related to the disclosure of protected information; allowing the delegation of ministerial powers to the Secretary, or an SES employee, of the Department of Health; amending the definition of dental provider; and correcting a minor technical error in section 4. Again, Labor will not be opposing these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to finish back where I started. We have serious concerns not so much about what is in this bill, but what the minister said when introducing itânamely his so-called concerns with the way in which the child dental benefits scheme has been structured, and that he is keeping a watching brief on these concerns. We have seen this before. This government's concerns are wholly manufactured excuses to lay the groundwork for cuts. Well, minister, Labor has concerns about what you have had to say and what you plan to do to this scheme and rest assured, we will be keeping a watching brief on you as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I flagged earlier, I would now like to move an amendment to this bill. Therefore, I move:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="137174" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NIKOLIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:36</span>):  I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. In particular, I would like to highlight a trifecta of equally important issues that address some of the revisionist history that we have just heard from the member for Ballarat. Firstly, the omissions and even injustices of the previous government in relation to policy in this important area; secondly, to focus on the benefits of this amendment bill to the dental profession, the very same professional community which were so unnecessarily harried by our predecessors; and finally, but perhaps most importantly, the practical benefits of this amendment bill for many Australians. This is most especially the case for those who have not been able to access adequate dental care because the former government had so mismanaged, then abandoned altogether, the practically-functioning and effective dental architecture enshrined in the then Chronic Disease Dental Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to the first of these issues: egregious former government oversight, occasioning negligence. The previous government's policy, operations and management of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, prior to formally closing it in 2012, was manifestly inadequate and unjust. This included, most particularly, their vindictive pursuit of dentists under the thinly veiled guise of Labor's purported commitment to recovering overpayments. This vindictiveness was directed at dentists who had treated in excess of one million patients. Yet, in reality, these financial transfers were, in the main, the result of minor technical errors in paperwork and administration. In this more balanced context, Labor's vocal condemnation and sometimes McCarthyesque pursuit and condemnation of dentists was overwhelmingly without substanceâand even bordered on being slanderous. It was in equal parts, cynical, shameful and wholly manipulative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What then, might you ask, was the real motive that impelled Labor's duplicity? It was the removal of a scheme to which they were, and remain, ideologically opposed, and in which the then Prime Minister had an obvious close personal interest. In a nutshell, Labor chose to forsake the collective public good because it presented the opportunity to attack the work of former health minister and current Prime Minister. By their actions, Labor sought to undermine an altogether effective dental scheme which was doing much good for many Australians, particularly those who were economically disadvantaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That Labor's pretext of choice was related to minor clerical errors says much more about the nature and quality of the opposition than about the largely innocent targets of their fault findingâthe hardworking dental community. Yet again, as has so often been the case with our opponents, this saga showed them to be more focused on parochial self-interest than on the broader and much more substantive issues of national strategic improvement and social wellbeing. This is a case of Labor not seeing the wood for the trees, of exaggerated attention to paper error rather than to the widespread alleviation of chronic dental disease and the pain and other health consequences that follow. Surely, in the interests of the very best social policy, all of us in this parliament must strive to elevate our thinking, well beyond the deadening hand of retrospective bookkeeping to a plane of higher, even enlightened, possibility to identify and seize ways in which the lives of our fellow Australians might be improved. During its period in office, from 2007 to 2013, over the issue of dental care, Labor fell very far short of this laudable standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to add a very human dimension to the consequences of Labor's action. In early 2013 I was approached by a young women, in her 20s, from Launceston, who was suffering from a very serious chronic dental condition. It was a condition that was badly affecting her lifestyle in every way, including her confidence. This young woman was at risk of losing her teeth from this chronic condition. Remember, this is a woman in her 20s. She only worked part time and did not have private medical cover and was simply unable to pay up-front for the desperately needed treatment she required. So desperate were her circumstances that she had sought loans and even tried to get an early release of her very modest superannuation to get the treatment she needed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy here is that, under the Liberal Party's Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, established under the former Howard government in 2007, her condition would have been covered because it was the only Medicare dental scheme that provided chronic dental treatment for adults. Under John Howard's dental scheme she could have accessed benefits of up to $4,250 over two calendar years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is instructive to note that 80 per cent of people who received treatment under the Howard government's Chronic Disease Dental Scheme were those who needed it mostânamely, concession card holders. It was a scheme that provided more than 20 million services to over a million patientsâthat is, before the Labor government closed it down for political reasons at the end of November 2012. No new patients were allowed to access services after 7 September 2012. You can do the maths. This left a 13-month gap in services, meaning that the young lady who approached me in Launceston, sadly, fell through the cracks. She was not the only one. There were children in the midst of treatment who were unable to have their treatment completed by 30 November 2012, when Labor arbitrarily changed the goalposts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The young lady I speak of was a victimâa real-life consequence of Labor's ill-considered, knee-jerk policy changes. We also saw ill-considered policy changes to border protection, pink batts, the live cattle trade, the NBN, overpriced school halls, with their never-ending appetite for borrowed money. It is a very long list and Australian taxpayers are bearing the consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the young woman I mentioned, I managed to get her the help she needed by pleading her case to a local service club. They came up with the $3,000 needed to start her treatment. We got the money, paid the dentist and her future health is now looking much brighter today, but all of that stress and pain should not have been necessary. We should not have had to rely on the goodwill of a Lions Club in Launceston.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I am particularly pleased to add my voice to a bill that amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008 in order to introduce critical changes for the efficient operation of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. It will also bring about an improved process whereby those dentists who have unknowingly erred clerically and/or administrativelyâbut certainly neither knowingly nor deliberatelyâas part of the former Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, will have these debts waived.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The detailed implementation of this effort will include two important things: a move to secure the appropriate waiver of these debts by the Minister for Finance, under section 34 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997; and the requirement for the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare to waive the debts of those dentists concerned, thereby saving both them and others, including indirectly the wider Australian public, much time and angst in the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These intended steps by the government are only fair and reasonable, and are also in keeping with this government's strong desire to differentiate between genuine error and deliberate financial misappropriation. To do otherwiseâas did Labor's bull-in-a-china-shop approachâwould be to continue to waste time, energy and emotion, not least of which on the part of our valued dentists. Such a course would also be contrary to that most rare commodity on the other side of the chamberâa welcome outbreak of common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps, most important of all for dentists is that these actions and initiatives will go a long way in matters which are other than financial in nature. By and through them, this essential and important professional body will be provided certainty of action, faith that their concerns have been patiently listened to and taken seriously, and some increased measure of professional esteem and self-respect by the constructive erasing of what many reasonably feel to be the former government's widespread tarnishing of their professional reputation, conduct and competence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also foreshadows additional improvements for the Australian community, including improved auditing and compliance mechanisms, the guaranteed independent examination of alleged or suspected future malpractice and enhanced efficiency measures. I will outline here how that will be achieved. Firstly, for auditing and compliance, in order to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent appropriately and that compliance audits are made as efficiently and effectively as possible, this bill introduces amendments which will more closely align the compliance frameworks of the Dental Benefits Act and Medicare. This will include the power to compel a provider to comply with a request to produce documents to substantiate the payment of future benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, for guaranteed independent examination of alleged or suspected malpractice, the Professional Services Review, or PSR, is an independent authority which examines suspected cases of inappropriate practice referred by the Department of Human Services. The PSR protects patients and the community from the risks associated with inappropriate practice, and protects the Commonwealth from having to meet the cost of medical and health services provided as a result of inappropriate practice. The PSR can currently investigate cases of inappropriate practice under the Medicare program and the PBS, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This bill will enable the PSR to also investigate cases of inappropriate practice under the Dental Benefits Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill establishes a provision requiring the chief executive of Medicare to waive debts raised against dentists in limited circumstances for services provided under the former Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It will allow the Professional Services Review scheme to apply to dental services provided under the Dental Benefits Act 2008, consistent with other Medicare services. It will ensure powers under the act enable the chief executive of Medicare and relevant employees of the Department of Human Services to obtain documentation to substantiate the payment of dental benefits in a similar way to Medicare benefits. The bill also makes a number of technical amendments to the act, including to support the framework for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dental health care may appear rather prosaic to someâdoubtless amongst this body are members of the former government whose collective efforts on it were so singularly unconstructive. Both their actions and their selective inaction in these areas impacted negatively on the provision of improved dental care for many Australians, including the distressed young woman about whom I raised the attention of this parliament. At the end of Labor's six years in office, the system was manifestly more inferior than it had been at the start. In no way were many Australians any better offâneither the highly qualified and dedicated professional dental community entrusted with providing this service nor many members of the long-suffering public, many of them whom should have been its fortunate beneficiaries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By our efforts on this bill, the government has, just as it has been compelled to do on so many other policy fronts, confronted a mess inherited from Laborâand, in this particular case, a mess exacerbated by a financial witch-hunt against dentists for a cynical ulterior motive and purpose. The government's efforts on this issue will be to the longstanding benefit of many Australians, regardless of their social circumstances. I, therefore, have much pleasure in commending the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  The bill before the House deals with two particularly important schemesâthe Medicare Chronic Diseases Dental Scheme and the Child Dental Benefits Scheme. They both deal with the way in which the Commonwealth government supports public dental services. In the case of the CDDS, it is about chronic diseasesâor it was about chronic diseases. In the case of the CDBS, it is about children's dental services and, particularly, what the Commonwealth can do to prevent the onset of chronic diseases within children at a very young age. There is agreement before the House on the passage of these bills but there is a very different approach between the major parties on how we deal with dental health and dental health care, and the public support for dental health care in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before addressing some of these issues, it is worth going through some of the key facts around dental health in this country. Many may not be aware that in 2010 government survey data showed that more than one-quarter of people aged five or older avoided or delayed visiting a dentist due to costâthat is, more than one in four aged five or over delayed visiting a dentist because of cost. From 1994 to 2010, there was an increase in the proportion of adults avoiding a visit to their dentist from 25 to 30 per centâagain, because of cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we contemplate health policy in this country and the introduction of price signals into the primary healthcare space, if we want to see the impact of a price signal on the delivery of health care in this country, we need look no further than the delivery of dental care. Here you have a fantastic dataset on the impact of a price signal when it comes to people accessing affordable health care, in this case dental care. What is the result? One in two 12-year-olds are experiencing tooth decay in their permanent teeth. In 2010, the proportion of children who visited a school dental service who had decayed, missing or filled baby teeth varied from 48 per cent for five-year-olds through to a massive 63 per cent for nine-year-olds. That is the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Normally when you see an improvement in the wealth and incomes of a country and improvements in health standards overall, you would expect that to flow through to all areas of health. But in dental care, we are not seeing that. Clearly something is going wrong. Only two in three people aged five and over visited a dentist in the last 12 months. Clearly we have some issues that we have to deal with. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the links between dental health, oral health and chronic health conditions, the research is quite clear. Dental decay is the second most costly diet related disease in Australia with an economic impact comparable with heart disease and diabetes. We know that there is a clear link between oral health and other chronic health diseases. Indeed, more than 63,000 Australians are hospitalised every year for preventable dental conditions. It is the third highest reason for acute preventable hospital admissions. Oral cancer is the eighth most common cancer in Australia. Dental disease has been linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory illness, stroke, dementia and low birth weights in babies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dental Health Services Victoria CEO Dr Deborah Cole has told that National Advisory Council on Dental Health:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Oral health can no longer be ignored. We have to protect natural teeth from decay and disease because these diseases are not limited to the mouth, they affect people's general health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a national survey, but if you attend your mind to the situation in rural and regional Australia, the numbers are far worse. It might surprise you to know, Deputy Speaker, that over the last two decades we have actually increased the number of dentists who are practising in this country. Unfortunately, over 79.7 per cent of those are employed in our nation's major cities. Just like in all aspects of the health system, people who are living in rural, regional and remote areas are at a disadvantage when it comes to access to a dentist and when it comes to affordability. Less than one per cent of dentists are employed working in remote parts of the country. People in rural and remote areas also suffer the highest rates of gum diseaseâ36.3 per cent compared to just 22 per cent in our major cities. The same goes for tooth decayâa massive 37 per cent in remote areas compared to just 23.5 per cent in major cities. When you look at the Indigenous demographics in remote Australia and compare that to non-Indigenous in both remote and rural areas and major capital cities, the gaps are greater still.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that the parliament needs to grapple with. Clearly, we cannot just simply leave it to the market. If the market was going to fix this, we would not have the glaring gap in services between rural and city. We would not have the glaring gap in health outcomes between rural areas, remote areas and city areas. Clearly, the market is not going to be the solution to resolving these chronic health issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps mindful of this issue, former Prime Minister John Howard set up the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme in 2007. Perhaps it was this massive problem that we had with chronic dental disease issues that moved the former government to set up the scheme in 2007. The scheme paid up to $4,250 over a two-year period for dental treatment for people whose teeth had become so bad that it was affecting their general health. A good idea in addressing chronic health issues, but unfortunately the CDDS was fundamentally flawed, poorly targeted, open to rorts within the system and did not provide support for the majority of Australian families struggling to afford dental care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Health conducted an audit of the CDDS and found that there was a high rate of noncompliance with provider-reporting requirements. Debts were raised against dentists found to be noncompliant through the audit process and indeed some of those debts have led to the legislation before the House today. We know that there were rorts going on. More than 20 per cent of the recipients were not pensioners or concession card holders. That is not a rort and I make no criticism of dentists for that. That is just an incidence of bad design. Each and every member of this House would have had constituents come before them over the period of the operation of the scheme and have complaints raised with themâcomplaints such as overcharging, poor workmanship on the design of dentures. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had people come to me in my electorate office on no less than a dozen occasions with problems that they had in accessing services and problems with the services that were provided under this scheme. It might have been a good idea, but it was certainly very poorly targeted. The checks and balances were not in place. You can only imagine: if it were a Labor government scheme, we probably would have had a royal commission into the matter by now. It was these reasons that led Labor in government to review the system and then to transition it to a closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a proud legacy when it comes to dental health care. In government, we announced the biggest dental package ever, the $4.1 billion Dental Health Reform Package, introduced by the then health minister, Tanya Plibersek, which came on top of nearly half a billion dollars in measures committed in the 2012-13 federal budget to address the oral health needs of Australians and to be provided over six years. The scheme Labor put in place was endorsed by the Australian Dental Association, the National Rural Health Alliance and the Australian Medical Association. It recognised the flaws in the previous schemes and targeted, on the one hand, preventive measures in young people providing a scheme to look after school aged kids and putting in place additional funding to reduce the waiting lists on the state-run public health systems, putting in place improved funding and assistance for capital works and training for future dentists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the Abbott government do on winning office? You might recall I mentioned the big gaps we had in the number of dentists practising in rural and remote areas when compared to those practising in the cities. One of the first things the Abbott government did when coming into power was to cut $40 million from the Voluntary Dental Graduate Year Program, designed to assist people take up the option of practising in rural and regional Australiaâ$40 million, one of their first acts, axed out of that program. That was only a curtain raiser for what was to come in the subsequent budget because then we saw over $390 million cut from the national partnership agreement struck to help reduce the public dental waiting lists. It was designed to deal with the sorts of chronic diseases that the member for Bass spoke about in his contribution to this debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever I hear the member for Bass give one of his fiery retorts in this place I have to wonder whether it was as fiery as the intervention he makes in his own caucus room. I wonder whether he got up in his own caucus room to denounce the $390 million cuts to dental programs ushered in by his own health minister and his own government as one of their first acts. I suspect the answer is no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before entering a debate on health, I always have a look at what the National Party has had to say on this issue because, as the so-called champions of rural and regional Australia, we always expect them to always have something to say and then to follow through with their actions. I looked at the policy platform which they took to Australians before the last election where they said at page 49:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We will give priority to the states in their efforts to improve the current public dental services and expand their ability to provide services beyond the basic emergency care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There you have it: a commitment, a promise to expand the current public dental services. They go on to talk about their long-term goal being extending Medicare into dentistry services. You have to ask yourself: where are the National Party members today. Are they going to stand up and condemn their coalition partners for the $390 million worth of cuts to those programs, which they were talking about defending? I look forward to those contributions. The Liberal and National parties have good form around this issue. If you are going to deal with dental health you have to do deal with prevention and fluoride is the key. A former Queensland Premier had put in place a program to ensure fluoridation to Queensland. One of the things you are going to see in Queensland in about 20 years time is a phenomena known as the 'Campbell Newman grin' because one of his first acts when he became Premier was to axe the $14 million set aside by the former Labor government to introduce fluoridation to  Queensland water. As a direct result, we are going to see dental health for Queenslanders, who have one of the poorest outcomes anywhere in the country, going backwards. I am looking forward to the contributions from the Queenslanders and the National Party members to this important debate on dental health care.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:05</span>):  It takes a special contribution to debate dental care for 10 minutes and not to mention the private dental sector who represent 98 per cent of the dental profession, but after all we are dealing with the Labor Party tonightâthat is right, with the massive scotoma they hold towards the private sector. They are just determined to funnel dental resources into an overstretched, under resourced public sector which cannot recruit dentists in the first place to do the work as the anathema for all dental challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to go back to 2007 to start this story and I will be brief because a lot of water has gone under the bridge. We have had some technocrat Labor health ministers in that time making a mess of the dental system. They never found a sector of medicine where they could not stick their finger in the hive and upset the professionals. They managed to do it in eye surgery. I recall the then member for Gellibrand deciding that she would arbitrarily halve the rebates the cataract surgery and being airlifted out of the red zone by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd when it all fell to pieces very early in 2010. The Labor government was determined to kick every part of the medical profession for the simple reason that they earn too much money. That is rightâthe fundamental sin of the medical profession in the eyes of this Labor opposition is how much money they ear. No matter how they try to couch the terms, that is really what they are trying to say to their voters. Of course, there is no problem with union reps earning enormous salaries; that is okay. In the six years they were at the helm the  Labor Party were determined to chase those nasty doctors and dentists, those beleaguered professionals as far as they possible could and to make life a bloody misery for them. That was the intention. The Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was held above their heads as the Howard legacy with which they were intent to haul dentists over a barrel. That is right: line them up and make life a miseryâfor no greater sin than they failed to fill out the form correctly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just step back a bit. We have got chronic disease initiatives for doctors, and there was no problem there with poorly filled-out forms. But it was not so for the dentists. For the simple reason that they were carrying out a former coalition government policy, they were chased to the end of the earth on every indiscretion and every incomplete piece of paperwork. Make no mistake: this service was almost always performed; it was just that the forms were not filled out correctly in the majority of cases. What the previous Labor government did was sinfulâin pursuing dentists who were just doing their job under the law of the day and treating the sickest Australians for their dental disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We just heard a Labor speaker tell you how the burden of dental disease is second only to one other cancer and that is responsible for a whole range of other diseases around the body. He was reading out the talking points from the Minister for Health's office. Isn't that chronic disease to which the dental program set up by the coalition was targetedâthose with chronic disease? That is exactly how you reduce morbidity. There is no point filling a tooth that is not causing a problem; it is filling the tooth that is leading to the heart disease. That was the essence of John Howard's problem. Often the good that men do is interred and the evil lives on after them. But I come here to simply say: the CDDS did many good things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you remember that about 60 per cent of people have concession cards, and that program delivered 80 per cent of the services to high-need Australians, the only sin of that program is that some people who did not have a concession card had the hide to line up and get that service. They had the hide to line up and get their teeth fixed. Having paid a progressive tax rate, having contributed to the country because of your higher income and having not taken a welfare cut, how does that dare to disqualify you from dental care in this great country? Dental care should be provided on clinical need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here you have the division. Forget all of this Labor preoccupation with not filling in forms correctly. You have got a Labor Party that wants to treat the poor and you have got a coalition that was treating the sick. The last time I checked, you pay tax according to your ability and you should have access to services according to need. To hear the previous speaker lamenting that 20 per cent of people had the hide to go and access dental care without having a healthcare card is appalling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those Australians who pay their tax, who do not have a welfare care and do not collect a family tax benefit A, I say thank you and, if you are sick, you deserve to be cared for equally and on the basis of triageâon the basis of your health or the severity of your illness. But, of course, the Labor Party is utterly blind to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second great hypocrisy in the Labor approach is that, having vilified the chronic disease scheme of the coalition and worked to close it down until they succeeded in late 2012, remember this: there was a coalition opposition then very willing to work with the Labor Party to reform the CDDS. Owing to how popular it was, we were quite willing to sit down with the Labor Party. So what did they do? They refused all advances. They refused all offers to reform the CDDS. Why? Because they wanted to hold it up above their heads unreformed, point to it and vilify it as a failed scheme. They spent five years doing just that without acknowledging that a few easy tweaks could have significantly improved it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could have looked at some forms of means testing. We could have looked at better targeting. We could have even carved some of those CDDS resources out and treated children. But, no, to make the political point they denied treatment for children for six years and instead allowed the money to pour into the CDDS and preferred to make the political point by blaming the coalition predecessors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back a step and think about chronic disease for a moment. Doctors can treat it without being harassed by a Labor government using chronic disease schemes but, no, dentists are different purely because it was set up by John Howard in 2007âno other reason. You can be a billionaire and go and get a chronic disease assessmentâteam based arrangements and allied health careâunder Medicare, but the minute you do it for your dental health, that was anathema to Labor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did they do? They set up a Child Dental Benefits Scheduleâthe CDBSâin which they have simply allowed $1,000 over two years for what? Exactly the same system that was under the Howard scheme still open to all forms of abuse, overtreatment and overcharging except you are treating a child instead of an adult. There is no difference, so they were quite happy to do that for kids and say it was a great reform but what have they done? Sure, they included the family tax benefit A eligibility criteriaâI have no problem with thatâbut overcharging and overservicing still happens with the child scheme. The very reason they undermined the adult scheme lives on to this day thanks to the Greens and the Labor Party proposition for child benefit dental care. I have no problem: the scheme should have been around years ago, but the very criticism they held was never addressed in their own scheme, and that is hypocritical to say the least.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, in order to bring that $4,250 available for seniors and those with chronic disease down to $1,000, the Labor Party started to make certain dental care ineligible for their new scheme. So to get it to $1,000, the first thing that the Labor Party saidâand we are talking about technocrat health ministers. We had a smart technocrat in the member for Gellibrand and then we had a not-so-smart technocrat in the current member for Sydney: the Latham without the loyalty. Under her and her predecessor's care, what we ended up with in that program was large amounts of money funnelled to state public dental systems that cannot recruit dentists and completely closing out private dentists from offering any form of public care, so you lose 98 per cent of your carers. Then last of all they said: You can't have bridges done. You can't have crowns done. They actually ruled out advanced and highly technical dental care from this child benefit dental scheme. That might be fine for my kids and yours but, if you go to an Aboriginal community where there is severe disease, that kind of treatment is absolutely necessary. But it has been obliterated from the Labor scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a Labor government with no understanding about Indigenous dental care, because those children need significant dental work. The alternative to a bridge and a crown for those that actually have not spoken to a dentist before is extraction. That means losing teeth instead of conserving them. The last time I checked in the last 10 years the great push in children is to conserve teeth, but this is a Labor government that actually excluded crowns and bridges from that care, obviously to save moneyâand I can see that imperativeâbut that does not work in Indigenous care. We needed a voucher system that provided the dental care that would absolutely conserve teeth in this most serious of situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point to be made is the exclusion of private dentists from the scheme. What I have said here is simple: the Labor Party hated that private dentists could access these payments. They then hated that the paperwork wasn't filled out completely but had no problem with doctors who did not. This bill finally brings those indiscretions under the PSR, which is a way more commonsense approach to examining these areas. Where dentists delivered the dental care but did not fill in the form, why can't they get at least part payment? No, they had to pay the entire amount back and that was so ridiculous. We had dental bodies around the country basically queueing up to beg the Labor government of the day not to take this action against dentists. But, for the Labor Party, it was not about the dentists or the patients; it was just about making a political point and bagging the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not for a moment going to say to you that the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme hit the nail on the head and delivered a comprehensive and complete scheme. But it targeted the most expensive, the sickest and the most complex cases and ensured that you were treated, whether you were rich or poorâremember that. I thought the previous speaker from Tasmania gave an excellent exampleâthat of a young working women, earning barely the basic minimum wage. This woman, in her late 20s, had decay through 20 of her teeth and was facing extraction of all of them and dentures. It was that Labor Party over there who said, 'Because you hold down a job, you can't have dental care. You shouldn't be eligible for it because you don't have a concession card.' That was their only concernâ'You work; so you are not eligible to go to a state dental facility and we do not care about you.' Under the coalition's scheme she would have had her teeth fixed, based on clinical need. The problem is that those opposite have never had a clinician of any quality over there to help them with their policy. You are driven by technocrats who care only about cost-cutting and niggling the professions who deliver this valuable care. I say to the opposition, 'You have a chance to rethink this.' The opposition now have a chance to rethink it and to get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We obviously support satisfactory arrangements for seniors, for those in need and for children. It should go down in the records that, while these are only minor amendments that take an enormous pressure off dentists, for six years it was the Labor Party who held up dental reform for no better reason than to have a target to shoot at in the form of the CDDS. They left us with no dental care for 13 monthsâin that almost fallacious fight to find a surplus that they could never deliver. People who were half treated with dental care were told, 'By the end of the month, there will be no more services that are public funded.' It was a disgrace at nearly every level. It is amazing to think that a party that pride themselves on social policy could get it so utterly wrong and, in the end, criticise us because a few rich people got their teeth fixed. That was apparently the sin of the CDDSâthat a single dollar went to someone who did not have a concession card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say thank you to those Australians who pay their tax under a progressive system, who work hard and who are self-reliant. If tough times and poor health befall them, they deserve some care from the stateâand that is a situation that has not been occurring in Labor state governments around the country. Under the CDDS they were denied that care. I look forward to a day when those people can get comprehensive dental care regardless of their age.</span>

                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:17</span>):  I speak in support of Labor's position in relation to the bill currently before the chamber, the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. The coalition has a shameful record of consistent and continual opposition to dental health reform in this country. We heard the hyperbole and insulting cantâtheological at timesâfrom those opposite and particularly from the member for Bowman, who is in the same political party as Campbell Newman, who has given no credit, by the way, to the Labor government's reforms which have made a difference in my home state of Queensland. Successive federal coalition governmentsâfrom Menzies to Abbottâhave failed to deliver fair, affordable and accessible dental care to all Australians. Conservative governments have never prioritised dental health. It does not interest them; you only get a half-baked policy from the coalition. I will go through a bit of background of what we saw before we had the CDDS, to see what the situation was. The member for Bowman talked about the history of this legislation. Indeed, in his second reading speech, the minister also talked about the history and the background to it. So I intend to deal with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, before I deal with that issue, I would note that the budget ripped $390 million from dental care by delaying the funding for the expanded national partnership agreement for adult public dental services for a year, from 2014-15 to 2015-16âwith no reason. If you want to talk about caring for those in need, why did you do that? This NPA funding is desperately needed to reduce adult dental waiting lists. The member for Bowman said that we were about helping the poor but not necessarily the sick. So let's have a look at what the experts have said about this measure. Griffith University Professor of Dental Research Newell Johnson described the funding delay as a 'disaster' for dental health. Australian Dental Association President Dr Karin Alexander warned that the delay would cause waiting lists to 'double or treble'. This $390 million, which should have helped people getting off waiting lists, will instead end up in the never-never of the Treasurer's medical research future fund. The Abbott government's budget also ripped $229 million by axing Labor's dental flexible grants program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's not get this hyperbole and cant from those opposite about their concern and compassion for people in this country with dental problems. If they were so compassionate, why did they undertake those budget measures in May this year? The dental flexible grants program provided for new dental infrastructure in outer rural and regional areas, but there was not a peep from the Nationals opposite in relation to that cut. No longer will that money be available to reduce the access barriers to dental treatment that people face, particularly in regional, rural and remote areas. In addition, the Abbott government cut $15 million from the Charles Sturt University dental health programâfunding needed to help the much-needed dentists of the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill provides a handy reminder of the coalition's dental policy failures and raises serious concerns about their future intentions. The bill deals with both a failed coalition dental schemeâthe Chronic Disease Dental Schemeâand the landmark Labor dental reform, the Child Dental Benefits Scheme. The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme is one of the health disasters that we inherited back in November 2007 from the Howard government. This has a bit of a potted history, and it is worth reminding the public about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1996 the Howard government cruelly and callously cut the Keating Labor government's Commonwealth dental-health program. This program provided federal government assistance to those Australians who could least afford it, so they could have their teeth fixed at public dental clinicsâanother great Labor reform, echoing Medibank before and Medicare of the Hawke and Keating era. This particular program followed the Whitlam Labor government's Australian school dental scheme, which was eventually and inevitably gobbled up by the Fraser coalition government. It is important for the edification of those opposite that they be reminded about this. The Commonwealth dental-health program workedâit was a terrific success. In 1997 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that the program had reduced dental waiting lists for the most disadvantaged people. Before that program, 47.5 per cent of people with health dental cards waited for less than a month for dental treatment, and 21.1 per cent waited for more than 12 months. While that program was operating, 61.5 per cent waited less a month for dental treatment, and only 11.3 per cent waited for more than a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as the Fraser government had abandoned Labor's Australian school dental scheme, the Howard government ignored the expert advice and abolished that particular programâthe Commonwealth dental-health program. And it did not just abolish it, it left no replacement for that superior program. They did not even have an alternative dental plan. They did not really care that disadvantaged Australians suffering health pain and dental pain lingered on the waiting list. Predictably, after the CDHP was abolished, the public dental waiting list blew out until 650,00 Australian people were on waiting lists for relief. People were waiting four or five years to have their teeth looked at. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A 2005 Health Policy Institute research paper found there had been a polarisation of oral health in Australia. It recorded that people disadvantaged by their socio-economic status, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, older people, migrants and people living in rural and remote areas were disadvantaged. In other words, they were exactly those Australians who had previously benefited from Labor's Commonwealth dental-health program. In that same year of 2005, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> investigated the impact of the ongoing dental crisis on people in New South Wales. It reported what everyone knewâthat oral health had declined since the federal government withdrew its funding for public dental programs after the 1996 election. Nine years after the cut, the impact was clear in New South Wales, where: 'There are only about 250 public dentists to cater for more than 2.5 million health-card holders, children and the elderly, while there are more than 3,000 private dentists available to treat the rest of the state's population.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in New South Walesâthe largest state in the countryâwere waiting eight years to see a dentist. And what was the response of the then-health minister, Tony Abbott, the now-Prime Minister? He said: 'The federal government has no plans to take control of public dentistry. I would not encourage you to think it is likely to happen.' His message was: 'If you want your teeth fixed, take it up with the states'âthere was no need for the Commonwealth to be involved in it. There was not an ounce of compassion or commitment in relation to the oral health of disadvantaged Australians. At the time, I was the chair of the health reference committee in Esk in the Brisbane Valley as a representative of the West Moreton Health Community Council. Esk is a little town that is now in my electorateâit was in the electorate of Dickson before. During the Howard government and until redistribution in 2009, it had been in the member for Dickson's electorate. There was not a peep from that prominent frontbencher during that time, while the Esk waiting lists for oral health were blown out. It was the issue that was raised again and again by consumers, by patients and by residents in the Brisbane Valley at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eventually, however, the pressure got too much, and this is where the gold-plated chronic-disease dental scheme came inâbecause the Howard government did it when the political pressure was on in 2007. It was a dismal disaster from the start. Right from the start it was a poorly-targeted mess that failed to address public dental waiting lists, provided nothing in terms of dental infrastructure and was silent on the workforce distribution. Shamefully, it did not even address the issues in relation to children's dental health, but it provided $4,250 over two calendar years for private dental services for those with a chronic medical condition and complex care needs. You might say, 'That sounds all right,' but the trouble was that a Department of Human Services audit found that more than 20 per cent of those benefiting were neither pensioners nor concession card holders. It was poorly planned. What we saw was that over 20 per cent of dental treatment was provided for high-cost restorative work without means testing. The scheme was a dental slush fund, and it was corrupted. This was budgeted for at a total sum of $90 million per year, but it quickly became a cost to the taxpayer of $80 million a monthânot $90 million a year, but $80 million a month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By June 2008 the former Labor finance minister, Lindsay Tanner, and his department had assessed it as costing $248 million, and it was estimated to rise into the billions in the next few years. What a shambles! This is from the Liberal Party that prides itself and poses and preens as the party of responsible economic management. This is a program that was going to cost the taxpayers $90 million a year and cost $80 million a month and was blowing out into the billions. That is the mess we faced, and what we also discovered when we came in was that a high rate of non-compliance for reporting requirements for dentists had been detected. That involved failures, and that is what has been dealt with in part by this legislation before the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Human Services identified $21.6 million in incorrectly paid benefits for debt recovery from dentists. When I was newly elected in 2007, one of the issues that was raised with me was the debt problems with this scheme, and I was pleased to speak on this scheme. Those in the government thinkâthis is what the minister said in his second reading speechâthat we are doing this for political reasons and solely because the architect of the scheme was Tony Abbott, the now Prime Minister, then the minister for health. It is because it was not means-tested, it was unfair, it was wasteful, it was a slush fund and we saw noncompliance by dentists. It did not address the real issues. That is why we brought to an end, over the opposition of the now government, the CDDS and brought in the Medicare Teen Dental Plan. As part of our $4.1 billion dental reform package, that was replaced and we ended up with a landmark reform like Medicare, like the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There was eligibility for children between two and 17 years to access subsidised basic dental care worth up to $1,000 over two yearsâeligibility based on means-testing the family. We did the heavy lifting in relation to this. Thanks to that scheme, over three million Australian children will benefit from regular visits to the dentist. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we put a massive amount of funding towards cleaning up the waiting lists. In that effort we provided funding to the states to clean up the long lists. Let me give an illustration in my electorate. In February 2014, the West Moreton Hospital and Health Service reported that this had reduced their list of those waiting for more than two years from 3,500 people to zero. There are amendments in relation to this legislation which we will supportâand other speakers have gone through the legislationâbut it is important that the people know the facts. The facts are that we have seen, in my home state of Queenslandâit was mentioned by the member for Bowmanâthe LNP state government trying to take the credit for the national partnership arrangements, including the more than $500 million that we put towards reducing the public waiting lists. What the current government in Queensland have done is issue vouchers to patients who have been on public waiting lists for more than two years or those who require urgent care. There is a time bomb coming in Queensland because of their attitude to fluoridation, as the shadow assistant health minister mentioned before. But there is a day of reckoning coming with the cuts that the government are making. They have demonstrated that they have got no commitment to oral health in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:33</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014, in which we have heard various speakers from both sides of the House getting quite passionate and giving their version of the facts as they have gone along the way. It just amazed me listening to the member for Blair talking about $80 million a month, when the previous government foisted on the current government $1 billion a month in interest payments. His crocodile tears in worrying about $80 million a month, after they foisted on the Australian people $1 billion a month in interest payments, just amazes me. Then he talked about the CDDS system, which was scrapped, and which he had started getting complaints about in 2007. If it was such a bad system, why did the Labor Party wait until 2012 to scrap it? The reason they scrapped it was, as the member for Bowman said, to try to achieve that impossible and elusive surplus, which they still have not managed to deliver since 1989.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me get back to my contribution on the bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, we on this side of the chamber have a long history of supporting and implementing healthcare policy initiatives that benefit all Australians. Where the coalition have worked to develop various policy structures that reflect the areas where Australians have indicated service delivery and support is needed the most, those opposite have taken schemes that were established or extended by the coalition and have shut them down or reduced their level of support, despite their high success rate. This is not because the schemes were ineffective or were not meeting their objectives, unlike many policy initiatives implemented by those opposite; it is because the Labor Party needed to find ways to pay for all their other policy failings and the enormous debt that seems to follow every Labor government throughout the history of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> I cannot mention Labor failings without highlighting some of the worst policy catastrophes in our recent history, like the pink batts scheme, their attempt to roll out the Building the Education Revolution and, of course, the fiscally unstable mining tax that generated barely any revenue. Now, apparently, the concept of learning from your mistakes still has not been caught onto by those opposite either, since, within days of the government scrapping the mining tax, the Leader of the Opposition announced that, if elected, the Labor Party plan to bring it back. These are of course just a couple of Labor's policy failings, which those in this place could simply unify under one umbrella and entitle: 'How not to run government'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have criticised this government's budget measures to put Australia's healthcare system and other policy portfolios back on a sustainable path, yet what we saw under the former government were a series of broken promises on health and the removal of fully funded initiatives that benefited the chronically ill. Those in this place would know that the Howard government introduced Lifetime Health Cover in 2000 as part of reforms that significantly increased private health insurance coverage in Australia. Yet what we saw under the former government was a series of changes to private health insurance that made it more expensive for the almost 11 million people that hold some form of private health insurance. Despite repeated promises that they would not change the private health insurance rebate, Labor means-tested it in 2009 and 2011, made changes to the indexation arrangements last year and removed the 30 per cent rebate on Lifetime Health Cover in 2012. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In six years of Labor being in government, household health costs increased by 35 per cent, and hospital waiting times for elective surgery grew from 34 days to 36 days. Let us also not forget Labor's attempt to roll out their $650 million GP Super Clinics Program, where 64 clinics were promised in 2007 but only 33 had been delivered when this government was elected last year to fix the mess of those opposite. Most recently, the true extent of Labor's hypocrisy was also highlighted in the government-commissioned Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report which clearly identifies a slowdown in health funding in 2012-13 under those opposite, despite their claims that they were spending more on health and their criticisms of this government's plan to put spending measures back on a sustainable path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, if this were not enough turmoil for our healthcare system, those opposite sought then to discredit and shut down a scheme that delivered much-needed treatments for those who were already suffering from other serious health conditions. The scheme I am of course referring to is the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, a scheme that was set up in 2004 and expanded in 2007 by the current Prime Minister as then health minister to provide capped Medicare benefits for dental services for people with chronic medical conditions and complex care needs and whose oral health was impacting on or exacerbating their condition. Benefits of up to $4,250 over two years were available to all Australians on a referral from a GP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the high level of support this scheme provided the chronically ill, those opposite sought not only to discredit its delivery but shut it down in 2012 and left patients with no Medicare benefits for dental services for dental services for 18 months, from 30 November 2012 to 1 January this year. The coalition fought hard to keep this scheme, with the now Minister for Health, Peter Dutton, moving a disallowance motion in September 2012 to disallow the closure of the scheme. I supported the motion in this place on the need to retain a scheme that had great success by the standards of any government, with more than 20 million dental treatments provided during the life of the scheme to more than one million patients, 80 per cent of whom were concession card holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a relationship with the Forgotten Australians, and during that period after the Chronic Dental Disease Scheme was down I met with quite a few of them. Many of them who had been under that treatment from the CDDS were extremely disappointed with the Labor government for having shut that scheme down, as many of them were in the middle of treatment and it was chopped off with them unable to get their chronic oral health problems fixed. Many of them were totally disappointed with the efforts and implementation of the destruction of the CDDS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the chronic diseases under this scheme were not prescriptive, chronic conditions are generally deemed as those of at least six months duration and include such conditions as asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, mental illness, musculoskeletal conditions and stroke. I highlight this because the three most common chronic conditions typically managed by GPs are arthritis, diabetes and depression, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Yet, instead of those opposite working to fix the issues raised in this scheme and assist sufferers with their condition, their answer was to put it in the too-hard basket and shut it down. They shut it down despite arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions affecting an estimated 6.1 Australians and diabetes affecting about one million Australians in 2011-12.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did the scheme have a high take-up by patients; it was also universally accessible, just like other Medicare schemes, and was appropriately funded under the policy frameworkâjust another thing those opposite never seemed to manage. It is also peculiar that those opposite continue to say they are a party that supports universal health care; when they shut down the Chronic Dental Disease Scheme they claimed it should only be available to concession card holders, which does not really make it universal. I agree that supporting our most vulnerable should be the priority of any government; but, last time I checked, universal health care includes everyone who seeks to access it. I guess we can just put that down to yet another policy contradiction by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite their inability to appropriately fund or manage policy initiatives, those opposite also attempted to discredit this dental scheme by claiming that there were massive cost blow-outs and the scheme was flawed. Considering the scheme was always funded appropriately under a coalition government and the average claim was $1,760, well under the $4,250 cap, I think we can also safely say that any blow-outs were once again the result of those opposite mismanagingâmismanagement that resulted in household health costs increasing by 35 per cent, education costs increasing by 39 per cent, gas prices increasing by 71 per cent, water and sewerage prices increasing by 79 per cent and electricity prices increasing by a massive 101 per cent in the six years those opposite attempted to govern. If we want to talk about blow-outs, perhaps those opposite need to remind themselves of the $91 billion of deficits between 2008-09 and 2012-13 that they left as their legacy to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, despite the coalition's best efforts to retain the scheme, it was shut down on 30 November 2012, with one of the reasons cited by those opposite being alleged rorting by dentists. The reality, however, was once again very different from what those opposite claimed. This alleged rorting stemmed from the scheme's requirement that dentists provide a written treatment plan and quotation to a patient before commencing treatment for the services to be eligible for Medicare benefits. A copy of the plan was also required to be given to the referring GP. A compliance audit did, however, reveal that dentists were not meeting these administrative requirements, which prompted the Department of Human Services to pursue repayment of the full amount of benefits paid by Medicare to these dentists. This non-compliance was, however, far from the rorting those opposite claimed, with the majority of these cases simply being due to minor paperwork errors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the view of this government while in opposition and remains our view today that to pursue the recovery of the full amount of the paid Medicare benefits was an excessively severe punishment. Thankfully, following the hard work of our colleague Senator Bushby, who introduced a private member's bill in the Senate to have this recovery action dropped for those dentists who were deemed to have only made administrative errors, common sense eventually prevailed. The private member's bill prompted a Senate committee inquiry which resulted in those opposite acknowledging what those on this side of the chamber already knew: a harsh and unfair line had been taken with this matter, and these actions needed to be resolved. The former minister for human services subsequently sought to have these debts waived under section 34 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, which leads us to the purpose of the bill before the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A statement by the former minister was issued on 12 October 2012 outlining how debts would be waived. This stated that debts would be waived for:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The late or non-provision of treatment plans and quotes for audited dental practitioners' claims made before April 2010; and in cases after this time where an audited practitioner has shown their intent to meet the Scheme's requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In these instances the Department of Human Services and the Department of Finance were required to assess these cases and make a determination. This has resulted in a lengthy and time-consuming process for both departments and has left dentists waiting two years for an adequate resolution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House today seeks to finally lay this matter to rest. It will waive debts for those dentists who made minor paperwork errors while providing a much-needed service to chronically ill patients and remove the unwarranted stigma that has for too long been attached to this scheme. It will achieve this by amending the Health Insurance Act 1973 to allow the Chief Executive Medicare, or CEM, to waive debts raised against dentists, as per the former minister's determination, rather than requiring the departments to assess all individual cases. In the majority of cases this will have no financial impact on dentists or the Commonwealth, as most dentists who incurred a debt due to noncompliance are yet to make this payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does, however, include a provision that repayment be made to the small amount of dentists who have already paid their debt to the Commonwealth. I acknowledge that there were a small amount of cases where evidence supported claims that dentists had committed fraud. This bill will not excuse those dentists from repaying their debt; it will only serve to waive the debt of those who acted in good faith and provided this much-needed service, but did not adequately fulfil the scheme's administrative requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to another key aspect of this bill which seeks to amend the Dental Benefits Act 2008 and the Health Insurance Act to bring the operational procedures of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule in line with other Medicare programs. By way of background, the Child Dental Benefits Schedule commenced on 1 January and is an extension of the former Medicare Teen Dental Plan. It provides eligible children aged two to 17 with access to up to $1,000 in benefits over two years to cover the cost of basic treatment. The scheme is means tested, requiring a child's family to receive family tax benefit part A or a relevant Australian government payment to be eligible. Currently, compliance powers for dental services are different to other Medicare schemes and investigative processes for inappropriate practice are not cohesive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments proposed in this bill seek to rectify this by aligning the two acts' compliance powers to ensure appropriate Medicare claiming is occurring. The changes will provide the CEM with the power to obtain documents from dentists to confirm that amounts paid under the schedule are accurate. Additional amendments will also provide the CEM with the power to enforce compliance and to impose civil penalties or recover any imposed debts on behalf of the Commonwealth in the event of noncompliance. Civil penalties would be imposed in those instances where the requirements detailed in written notices are not complied with. For an individual the civil penalty is 20 penalty units, and for a body corporate it is 100 penalty units.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:47</span>):  It is a real privilege tonight to speak on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and I want to thank the member for Ballarat for moving her second reading amendment, which allows me to speak a little bit more about what is an incredibly important area of public policy in Australia. It is one that concerns literally thousands of people that live in my electorate, one I am often contacted about when I talk with the people that I represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of us in this House know that dental care in Australia over many, many years has really been a poor cousin of health care. Many Australians who are able to privately paid their own dental care probably do not realise that there are thousands of people around the country who are having to bear very substantial costs which they are often not able to meet; living in intense pain that comes from issues with their oral health; and, importantly that the burdens of the way that the legislation has worked in this area have fallen so unfairly on different groups within the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Australians who are struggling with dental problems have watched over many years while the problem has been passed from government to government, some of them making real attempts to reform and change in this area and others who have, unfortunately, gone backwards. I know that the situation that we are dealing withâparticularly that the Rudd government was dealing withâwas a situation in Australia where we had these very significant and very fundamental divides between the funding of health care. We saw completely different dental care being provided for people who had private means in Australia versus those who were relying on government services. We saw staggering differences in the dental health of people whether they were lived in the city, whether they lived in outer metro areas or the country, Even between young and old there were different sorts of policies that applied. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I think that one of the fascinations of public policy in Australia when we come to these points is really that there is no reason why it is that the kind of overall profound strong foundation that we have for health care in Australia has not extended to mouth care, just by one of those little quirks. It is a bit of quirk because we know that the health of people's teeth is actually incredibly important to their overall health. So issues with tooth care can lead to lots of other health problems in the individual. It is associated with some specific conditions around poor nutrition, stroke and diabetesâeven cardiovascular disease. We also know that poor dental health is an incredibly important social issue in the sense that it is tightly linked to socioeconomic status. I think there is no accident there, because we all know how expensive it is to go to the dentist. We also know that those costs have increased, when we look back in time, much, much quicker than the cost of living has increased. So in that sense for people who are struggling or living in poverty, that is a thing that often just falls off the agendaâthe thing that they just cannot afford.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has some incredibly proud reforms that it put in place when it was in government. I know that all of us in this House, if we had all the budget in the world, would probably want to make the perfect systemâuniversal, top-quality dental care like we often see in our health system. But obviously that is not a situation we usually find ourselves in when in government. So that last government made a really strong commitment to do what it could with the limited funding available and made some very important reforms that really moved us in the right direction at least. I want to talk a little bit about those reforms. I want to just mention that it is important to see that they were done in the Labor wayâthat is, accepting that we do not have all the money in the world and accepting that because of that we need to target reforms very tightly, put dollars where they are going to count the most, make sure that those dollars are going to the people who are most in need. And that was certainly how this issue of trying to fix the dental care system was approached.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012 Labor announced a dental reform package of $4.1 billion, which was the biggest investment in dental care since Federationâa really amazing achievement. It was essentially set out in three large elements. The first was the Child Dental Benefits Schedule; $2.7 billion for 3.4 million Australian children. That is fantastic for 3.4 million Australian children. A lot of the motivation to focus on children was not accidental; it was linked to some very disturbing evidence that came to light around 2009 when the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that the dental health of young people in Australia was going backwards. So while we had so much prosperity and while we were growing much wealthier as a country, dental health in young people was actually going backwards. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that 58 per cent of 14 year olds had permanent tooth decay and 20,000 children under the age of 10 were hospitalised each year because of tooth decayâit is an absolutely astounding fact. So the centrepiece of this beginning, of trying to fix this big issue in Australian public policy, was a program for three million Australian children aged between two and 17. The idea was that for those children going to the dentist would be just like going to the doctor, with the same level of ease and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first element I mentioned was the Child Dental Benefits Schedule, but there was also the $1.3 billion for additional services for low-income adults. That was for 1.4 million low-income adults around Australia to get the dental care that they so urgently needed. I mentioned before that we know there are links between people's dental care and their socioeconomic status. You would be interested to learn that if you earn more than $60,000 a year you have seven more teeth on average than Australia's poorest people. Now that is fundamentally unfair and I do not think we want to see that situation in Australia. That was the big second tenant of this reform packageâthat is, services to low-income adults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third element was a very important piece that I do not want to get lost, which was about workforce planning. It is much harderâand I think remains much harder despite these effortsâto get good, affordable dental care outside of the inner areas of our major cities around Australia; It is even hard to get it in the outer metro areas, much less regional, rural and remote areas. It is just simply much harder to find a dentist there. We know in Australia that the number of dentists in our major cities is actually double those in outer regional areas and triple those in remote areas, so we have to accept that the funding element is very important here. It is a critical piece of the puzzle. But it is also important that people who need to go to the dentist are able to find one. I know that for people living in outer metropolitan electorates like the Lalor electorate, whose member is sitting here behind me, these would be big issues that are facing her constituents. These are the things that Labor was really focused on when it was in government and putting in place this huge reform package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course that was not all that was done on dental. We know that when the Rudd government was elected public dental waiting lists were absolutely ridiculous. We are talking years and years that people, often pensioners, were waiting for help with dentures and other types of things like that. It was just absolutely untenable that we saw this sort of thing in our system. In the 2012-13 budget, Labor committed $550 million in funding of the public dental waiting list. In 2013, 200,000 patients around Australia received much needed dental care just because of that funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can probably tell that I am very proud of these reforms. I think it was some of those really pivotal things that that government was able to do that affected the lives of literally millions of Australians and, in many instances, Australian children. When we look at all of the different areas we deal with in this parliament, it really is Labor that goes forward and makes these reforms. Those on the other side of the House talk a little bit about reform, but they really do only move in one directionâthat is, making cuts. They sometimes increase services, often looking to improve supports for the wealthy; however, what we do see time and time again is moves to take away supports that are needed for those who need them most. And not surprisingly we do see this when we come to dental. The coalition have had to be dragged by their heels into supporting moves to progress and enhance the sustainability and the level of dental care that is provided around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands, most dental care has historically been funded by individuals, and we know, unfortunately, that is how the coalition likes it without regard to whom that person might be. I will digress for a moment: we really see this in the cuts that have been attempted on Medicare at the moment. We were absolutely promised in the election there would be no cuts to health, no new taxes, and yet what do we see? At the very first opportunity the attempts to put these additional costs into the systemâalways pushing the burden onto individuals when we are trying to get public services to world-class standards. We know there are changes to pathology and changes to other tests, all of these types of things. We see it in Victoria: the ongoing industrial issues with ambulance workers, with nurses; there is not a health worker that that state government has not picked a fight with at some stage in the last couple of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I digressed to that topic because I fear that this is where we are going to go on the dental question, and we heard some very concerning rhetoric from the minister when he first presented this legislation into the parliament. He talked about 'early concerns that he had with this program', saying things like 'we will monitor this program very carefully'. We have all heard this story before: we heard it on university funding; we heard it on school funding. The truth is that you just cannot trust these guys with anything because, as I said, unfortunately the coalition only know how to do one thing. When you look at Labor's very proud record in this area, we can see that dental care and the terrific reforms that were made are absolutely worth protecting. They protect many of your constituents, Madam Speaker, and they protect many of mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will turn to some of the specific provisions in the bill itself. Much of what is in this bill is tidying up elements of the existing scheme. Of course we are very happy to support moves to do that. So the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was closed from December 2012.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:00</span>):  I rise this evening to once again focus on the Abbott government's cruel cuts to education. We have seen this government cut money from the whole spectrum of education. There has been a range of cuts, including to early years education, and cuts to the childcare benefit and family day careâa whole range of nasty cuts in that area. It does not stop there. There have been cuts to schools. There have been cuts to trade training centres. There have been cuts to vocational education and, finally, cuts to higher education. It does not seem to matter what area of education you might study or work in, it has not been spared from the Abbott government's cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very far cry from their solemn pre-election commitment of 'no cuts to education'. That was a solemn commitment made by the now Prime Minister, but he seems to think that the more times he breaks his promise, the less people will notice. We know that is just not the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I visited a number of different educational institutions that have been affected by these cruel cuts. I have already spoken about a number of those today in the parliament, but I would like to talk about Rose Bay High School which I visited with the member for Franklin. I had a wonderful tour of the school and I thank the principal for that tour. This school wanted to get a trade training centre. They were ready to get a trade training centre. They had their proposal ready to go but, without notice, this government has cut $950 million from the trade training centre program. This means 650 schools throughout Australia, like Rose Bay High School, will never have the opportunity to get that money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to the Principal of Rose Bay High School about the impact that would have. He said that he had seen the benefits in other neighbouring schools, and what money would allow him to do is partner with those schools to offer a really good vocational education pathway to so many students. This is a school that has grown significantly as a result of another school in the local area no longer running, so they are desperate to offer more vocational pathways. They are trying to go ahead with funding their own trade training centre but it is difficult and has to be done in stages. They are very disappointed that this money is no longer available and they will not be able to offer as broad a range of vocational education as they had hoped to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems incredibly mind-boggling that the government is walking away from the trade training centre program. I have called on them many times to reverse this decision. It is unfair. We need strategies to really address this, especially in the state of Tasmania where we see high youth unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I was visiting Tasmania I visited the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies along with the senator for Tasmania, Senator Lisa Singh. The institute plays a key role in research into the Antarctic and has a number of PhD and master's student programs that are offered in conjunction with the University of Tasmania. They work very closely with the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre which is housed in the same precinct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, or maybe it was the week before, we heard the Minister for Industry say that cooperative research centres could well be folded without any notice. That is a real concern for that cooperative research centre which does research not just into industry, but into how we can best adapt as a communityâresearch into the human cost of climate change and how we can best ensure we are working towards an adapted environment in the face of climate change. We also discussed the higher education reforms which will not only cut money from undergraduate students but also from higher research students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />These are just some of the examples that are hurting Tasmania. I call on the government not to continue to cut education; keep your election promise and make no cuts to education. Do not keep cutting. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  I rise to provide the House with an update on the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund, known as the GRIIF. Across Corangamite and the broader Geelong region, there is no issue more important than jobs. With our region under some pressure and unemployment too high, our government recognises how important it is to support the private sector in delivering the jobs of the future. These are in the growth sectors of the economy, including in advanced manufacturing, food processing and agriculture. Last week the federal government, in partnership with the Victorian government, Ford and Alcoa, announced 580 new jobs across five businesses in our region in just eight days. I was delighted to be joined by the Minister for Industry, Ian Macfarlane, to make these announcements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me talk about some of the great companies which are delivering these jobs. Farmfoods, a great local producer of value-added meat products, will create 27 new jobs in Geelong by 2016. The company won a $525,000 grant that will be used to install new meat-processing and packaging equipment and will also assist the company to open up more export opportunities in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore. Organic Dairy Farmers Australia, another terrific company, which started off in south-west Victoria has been awarded a $600,000 grant. Organic Dairy Farmers will establish a new cream and cheese processing and packaging line in North Geelong. This will allow the company to increase its capability to expand both its domestic and export markets and to create new jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quick-Step is another innovative company, with a grant of $1.76 million. It will be establishing a pilot production facility at Deakin University's Carbon Nexus in Waurn Ponds. This facility will enable the development of low-volume production runs of composite face components for the global automotive market. In a media release, Quick-Step Executive Chairman, Tony Quick, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This grant will make an important contribution to enable us to build a strong automotive culture and propel Quick-Step further into the global automotive market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we are seeing, along with the likes of Carbon Revolution, which is a company producing carbon fibre state-of-the-art wheels for the global market, are amazing companies working in the automotive global manufacturing market. Let's not forget that, while Ford is closing its manufacturing of cars in Australia, the 490 jobs at Ford at the proving ground and at its product development plant are continuing. This is a far cry from the doom and gloom we heard from the member for Corio, who wrongly claimed in a speech on 1 October in this House that these jobs were at risk. Ford has confirmed, and I state for the record, that these jobs are not at risk. In fact, these are the very jobs which are helping us to become a smart manufacturing city. I proudly talk about those jobs and I proudly talk about our potential as a smart manufacturing hub, perhaps the premier smart manufacturing hub in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also delighted that a wonderful company based in Geelong, Cotton On, has received a very substantial $3.4 million grant to support an $8.7 million expansion. This is an incredible company that started in 1991 with one small store in East Geelong. It now has 1,300 stores in 17 countries across the globe. The headquarters in Geelong is incredible. It is our own Silicon Valley. It really is incredible what is happening at Cotton On. It is a great credit to the management and to the staff there with respect to what is going on there and how quickly they are expanding, which will lead to another 300 jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also Australian Lamb Colac Pty Ltd, a great company in Colac. I was at the Colac business awards on Saturday night. They took out the top prize, so congratulations to Australian Lamb. Again they have won a GRIIF grant, delivering up to 200 jobs and another 100 trade jobs. In total, under the GRIIF program, we have seen some 834 jobs. We are demonstrating incredibly strong jobs growth in the Geelong region through the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund and we are very proud to support that fund. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:10</span>):  My focus in this adjournment debate is on apprenticeships and youth employment. Last week in my electorate I focused on apprentices and apprenticeships. The Lalor electorate currently has 3,800 apprentices. I visited Cummins, a heavy diesel-engine maintenance company, a global company that was a recent winner of the Wyndham Business Awards for their great work with local schools in trades and in preparing and training apprentices. This company has links to the local LLEN and the Beacon Foundation, as well as schools. I also had a visit from shadow minister for vocational education, Sharon Bird. We had a meeting with apprentices at the Werribee Plaza building site. I learnt a lot from both visits. At Cummins I heard about their membership of Beacon, which speaks to this global company's positive corporate attitude to youth employment. I also heard about their involvement in the Local Learning and Employment Networkâthe LLENâwhereby they have donated diesel engines to the Point Cook Senior Secondary College Trade Training Centre. Students from across the Wyndham VET cluster access this equipment. They provide great support for apprentices and their current apprentices act as young ambassadors in mentoring roles for students from Lalor and Wyndham. Through Beacon, they help develop employment skills through mock interviews and resume requirements in a voluntary capacity. It was a terrific visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the shadow minister I had a very powerful meeting with apprentices at the huge Werribee Plaza redevelopment site. It was great to see the pride in these young adults as they move to adulthood and work. In the meeting the dozen or so apprentices raised a few issues with the shadow minister and me. They talked about the great program that was Tools for Your Trade. One young plumber talked about his regret that in his second year he would not be able to purchase the tools that he had planned to buy after purchasing a collection of hand tools in his first year. None of the dozen or so apprentices that we spoke to were interested in the loan option. There was only one apprentice considering it, but he expressed that his parents were not keen. And now we know that only one per cent of apprentices across Australia have applied under the new loan scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It became apparent that, when we were talking about licensed trades of both plumbers and electricians, half-a-dozen apprentices on the site joined us that day but, when it came to carpentry and non-licensed trades, there was only one carpentry apprentice on site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It came to light in our discussions that there were many 457 visa workers on that site who were potentially taking the place of young apprentices from my local area. I think that is a shame. They also discussed increased TAFE fees and the quality of their courses. They expressed concern about some of the private providers and that they did not think they were the best option. They talked about a lower quality and sometimes more expense. They also talked about a lack of reimbursements sometimes from their employers for up-front fees for TAFE. They talked about the high cost of licensing test fees at the end of their apprenticeships, particularly the electrical apprentices who were faced with fees of $1,500 to sit their A-grade exams and of course that is at the apprentice's cost. They also spoke with great remorse about cuts to the mentor program. However, I was pleased to hear that the apprentices value the union support they were getting on site for those in licensed trades. The CFMEU officer was a member of the LLEN and was assisting in that capacity to ensure local kids get connected to commercial building opportunities. The ETU has an apprentice advocate who visits the site regularly and acts as a sounding board and support for apprentices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am critically concerned about youth unemployment and youth underemployment, because Melbourne's west has high youth unemployment. I am critically concerned about what I heard from some of those apprentices. Although we saw fabulous work happening with Cummins and its links to the LLEN and schools, I am afraid that unless a state Labor government is returned to government in Victoria that will be gone too. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="139441" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr O'DOWD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:15</span>):  Tonight, I want to speak about industry and the environment in the Gladstone region and how this is working in unison. Gladstone is a major economic centre. It is a major port and industrial centre of Central Queensland. LNG processing and the export of LNG gas will commence in December 2014. It is already a coal transporter and exporter of many products, including aluminium, alumina and cement powder. There is an oil refinery that has engineering and construction teams in place. Almost a third of the state's exports are traded through the Port of Gladstone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The industry and a healthy environment are essential. The industry is essential to the economy, to Gladstone and to the rest of Australia. A healthy environment is a prerequisite for tourism and the fishing-rig industries, and for those two industries to flourish. Gladstone's long-term future depends on both. They are not just important for tourism and fishing, they affect the whole liveability of the region and the amenities that go with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People who live and work in the region expect and demand that the environment is properly protected. Government and industry know this and are determined to ensure the highest environmental standards are maintained. Can industry and the environment coexist? Yes, they canâthey definitely can. In Gladstone, industry and a healthy environment do coexist. They are essential for the region to continue to prosper. This government is determined to ensure they do. Industrial development must be sensitive to the environment. When problems occur, they need to be resolved quickly and effectively. And, of course, when you have industry, things do go wrong from time to time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government, industry and the community have generally done a pretty reasonable job of balancing industrial development in harmony with the protection of the environment. There have been some hiccups. Gladstone does not have an unblemished environmental record. The failure of the bund wall adjacent to the harbour, where we reclaimed 300 hectares of land, had issues in the early parts of 2011 and 2012âand I might add that it was then under Labor management. The independent review was released in May this year. They found that the construction of the bund wall was flawed. Poor oversight was found to be a major factor. There have been inadequate approval conditions, and there were complex and fragmented regulations. But no blame could be pointed at any one person or any one company. The structural flaws have since been rectified, the water quality has been restored and I am pleased to report that the fish, dugong and other sea animals have returned to the harbour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the bund wall was constructed, there have been changes to our governmentsâboth at the state and federal levels. There are much tighter environmental conditions now applied to any dredging operation up and down the Queensland coast or along any coastal waters of Australia. There are much tighter regulations governing environmental projects associated with the harbour works and the dumping of dredge spoil. Gladstone harbour and waterways are subject to intensive testing and monitoring regimes to ensure the highest environmental standards are maintained. Gladstone, I believe, is the most monitored place in the southern hemisphere for air and water quality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protection of the Great Barrier Reefâyes, that is a concern to us and we are doing our best to look after the Great Barrier Reef, and the results are there for all to see. The Australian and Queensland governments released comprehensive strategic assessments of the Great Barrier Reef and the World Heritage area. The report discussed the issues affecting the reef and what is needed for its protection. The report shows continued best practice management is required to lessen the impacts of port development. As with all other sites, disposal of dredge spoil is not permitted in marine parks. Dredging to create new ports has been prohibitedâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:20</span>):  On 25 July, the Australian Human Rights Commission released its report into workplace discrimination against new parents: <span style="font-style:italic;">Supporting working parents: pregnancy and return to work national review</span>. One woman told the commission:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I would describe my experiences during pregnancy, whilst on parental leave and on returning to work as harrowing, disappointing and probably the worst experience of my life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She also said that despite being thrilled about the pregnancy and being physically well she felt powerless, vulnerable and fearful about her job security. Stories like this should attract the close attention of parliamentarians and the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last Labor government radically improved the way that our community supports new parents. In 2010, we legislated for Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme, providing 18 weeks of paid leave to working parents. When that legislation was before the House, the Member for Jagajaga, then Minister for Families, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The government's scheme meets the challenges and realities of modern family lifeâgiving parents more time at home with their new baby and helping them balance their work and family responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, we built on this scheme by providing for a further two weeks of dad and partner pay. These were great Labor reforms of which I am very proud. These measures support ordinary working Australians in a crucial time in their lives. In 2013, the Labor government built on this legacy by asking the commission to undertake research to identify the prevalence of discrimination in relation to pregnancy at work and return to work after parental leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Review led by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick has produced a groundbreaking dataset about the incidence of workplace discrimination against new parents. Half of all mothers experienced discrimination in the workplace during pregnancy, parental leave or on return to their job. The review showed that alarming numbers of working mothers lose their jobs or are threatened with dismissal. They are deprived of opportunities and career progression. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just about job security and conditions though; it goes to the dignity of work. Large numbers of working mothers are robbed of the respect and dignity they deserve as workers and as mothers by the negative comments or attitudes of their employers and co-workers. And this problem does not just afflict women; more than a quarter of fathers were also discriminated against. Indeed, this is a problem for us all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consultation undertaken by the commission makes clear that discrimination against working parents is an issue affecting all workplaces and the wider economy. The review makes a strong case that workplace discrimination not only creates significant barriers to women returning to work after having children but also comes at a cost to business productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission has made a number of important recommendations to deal with the serious problems it has uncovered. The report recommends an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to extend the discrimination ground of family responsibilities to cover indirect discrimination and include a positive duty on employers to reasonably accommodate workers who are pregnant or have family responsibilities. There is also a recommendation for government to fund a national prevalence survey every four years on discrimination associated with pregnancy, parental leave and return to work after parental leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The passage of Labor's paid parental leave policies into law was evidence that, as the member for Fraser said while speaking to the dad and partner pay legislation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The work we do in this place impacts on people's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The review makes it clear that discrimination in the workplace has an enormous impact on the lives of parents and families in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, Labor showed that it could take action to improve the lot of working parents, to use government to tangibly improve the lives of families. This government should rise to the same task. The government has now had months to consider the review. It should formally respond to the review as soon as possible and begin seriously considering how its recommendations might be implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is happy to assist in this work, but it is clear that the seriousness of the problem deserves a response from government now.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:25</span>):  I rise tonight to acknowledge the resilience and honour the engine room of my electorateâthat is, my small business sector. Wright is a diverse and picturesque electorate, bordering Mudgeeraba in the south-east corner of Queensland, extending over the Tamborine Mountain ranges, taking in the picturesque Scenic Rim and Lockyer Valley, bordering the top of the Toowoomba range and taking in the New South Wales border. I am so privileged to represent such a beautiful electorate. The beauty is not only the landscape; it is also the personalities of those who serve you, whether you are a local or a tourist experiencing the Wright experience for the first time. Madam Speaker, I know you would love to have a look at the electorate of Wright. We will get you up there soon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the chamber that the Shop Small movement will run throughout the month of November. Shop Small is a national movement which was launched by Prime Minister Abbott last year. For the month of November, shoppers are encouraged to buy from local small businesses and to generally recognise the vital role that mum-and-dad business owners play in the life of the communities they serve. For a lot of communities throughout the electorate of Wright, shopping small is the only option. A lot of our communities do not have large retail outlets. In fact, we do not have a picture theatre. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our biggest department store is a shop by the name of Maynard's in the small community of Boonah. I will share a small story about Maynard's. It recently celebrated its 70th year in business. The family-owned department store was opened in 1944 by Jack and Ethel Maynard and is managed today by Gregâwho is quite a handy golfer as well. He has five staff, including Errol Lankowski, who has been with Maynard's for 52 years. That is a testament to the loyalty of those business owners and a significant milestone for a local small business. It is my suspicion that it is a fairly rare commodity to have employees stay for that period of time. Other businesses in my electorate include the Dennis family and their robotic dairy enterprise, which I have spoken about in this House on a number of occasions. There are over 10,000 small businesses in my electorate and the estimated total turnover of the sector is around $1 billionâthe largest contributor to gross regional product in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Lockyer Valley Regional Council will shortly be holding their business excellence awardsâa way that our local community connects and acknowledges the great work that our small businesses, our family owned businesses and our microbusinesses do in sometimes trying conditions. I would also like to acknowledge the support associations, the chambers of commerce, who help guide small businessâthe Mudgeeraba Chamber of Commerce; the Logan Country Chamber of Commerce; the Lockyer valley chamber, which trades as Lockyer Better Business; the Tamborine Mountain Chamber of Commerce; the Kooralbyn Valley Chamber of Commerce; the Springbrook Chamber of Commerce; the Beaudesert Chamber of Commerce; the Boonah District Chamber of Commerce; and various others. To all the members, presidents and executives who give their time freely for the betterment of our community, I acknowledge and thank you for your contributions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge that in the last couple of years businesses in my electorate have suffered and in the last couple of years 25 per cent have gone by the wayside. The Abbott government and the coalition are committed to ensuring that we provide an environment where businesses can continue to grow, continue to employ and continue to be the cornerstone in our communities. To all the local businesses throughout the electorate of Wright, I honour you, I salute you and I thank you for the work you do in our communities. You are part of our future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I want to take his opportunity to remember and pay tribute to Ray Lees, a dear friend, who died Wednesday 15 October aged 85. He was a man of great integrity, decency, energy and community spirit who played a significant role in shaping the City of Cockburn, the largest local government in my electorate; and who throughout his life dedicated considerable energy to public service and the interests of working men and women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ray was born and bred in Fremantle. He left school at 14 and worked delivering ice by horse and cart before joining a Norwegian supply ship in 1943 to support Allied troops when he was only 15. After the war he worked on the waterfront in Fremantle and was an active member of the Waterside Workers Union throughout his 42 years on the wharf. He was a proud Labor member and there would be literally a dozen state and federal parliamentarians, myself included, who had the benefit of Ray's advice and local campaigning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ray Lees began his incredible contribution to local government in 1972 when he was elected to the council of what was then Cockburn Shire. He remained a representative of the South Ward for 30 yearsâand in that time was never opposed. Over that period, Cockburn grew from a shire into a town and then into a cityâit is now one of the fastest growing outer metropolitan areas in Australia. It was entirely appropriate that when Cockburn became a city it did so under the excellent guidance and stewardship of Mayor Ray Lees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the local federal member, I have been grateful to Ray many times since my election for his knowledge and good counsel about all things Cockburn. It has been my privilege to work closely with Ray's successors in the City of Cockburn to help achieve the provision of important community infrastructure like the new integrated health facility at Cockburn Central and the new Coogee Surf Life Saving Club in Coogee. And considering Ray's important work in establishing both the South Coogee and Jandakot bush fire brigades, and his membership of the Western Australian bush fire board, I know he very much welcomed the creation of a new fire and emergency service headquarters in Jandakot, funded by the former Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the current Mayor, Logan Howlett, his fellow council members and city staff feel a great deal of gratitude and affection for Ray Lees. I know that Ray's contribution to his municipality through three decades of service is widely recognised and valued by the community he served with such heart and hard work and dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ray Lees was named a Freeman of the City of Cockburn in 1997. In 2005 he was made a life member of the WA branch of the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking today of Ray I also want to speak of Rose, his wife and best friend of 60 years, who died in 2006. Rose of course had a share in every achievement of Ray's. She was his partner in all their endeavours, from market gardening to good governance, and especially in shaping their wonderful familyâtheir children, Glenda and Alan, their partners, their grandchildren, and their great-grandchildren.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our condolences and best wishes are with the Lees family as they remember and celebrate the remarkable life of Poppy Ray. We love Ray, we miss him and he will live in our hearts.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to provide an update on the No. 1 local issue impacting my constituents across the length and breadth of my electorate of Patersonâunreliable digital television reception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the switch-over from analogue to digital technology in November 2012, I warned the previous government that existing self-help transmitters would have to be upgraded and new transmitters installed across my electorate to ensure viewers would continue to receive reliable television reception. My lobbying to Regional Broadcasting Australia Holdings, which is jointly owned by the commercial broadcasters, resulted in upgrades to self-help transmitters at Elizabeth Beach, Smiths Lake, Stroud and Forster and a new transmitter at Anna Bay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, more than a third of my constituents continue to be exposed to these problems and they are justifiably livid. Much of this anger stems from the previous government's get digital ready campaign that dishonestly promised my constituents that the changeover would result in equal to or better television reception. Now, many of those contacting my office have never had worse reception. Prime TV that was previously broadcast on a different frequency now also fails along with the other channels since the retune process. Mr Steve Brown, Broadcast Engineering and Technology Manager at NBN TV Newcastle, concedes that the installation of self-help transmitters has largely resolved the majority of interference problems on the Tomaree Peninsula and Anna Bay areas. It has also filled in the coverage gaps at locations like Boat Harbour, Corlette and Nelson Bay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The broadcasters advised me that if ACMA was unable to reallocate the clashing frequencies, the only other solution was three new sites at Peppers Mountain, Stroud region; Wallaroo Forest, to service Karuah, Medowie and Tilligerry Peninsula; and Nerong, to service the Bulahdelah area; plus power upgrades to existing sites, including Gan Gan; and the broadcast of commercial networks from the Vacy transmitter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I rise to note that Saturday, 11 October was the International Day of the Girl Child. In 2011, the United Nations General Assembly declared October 11 as the International Day of the Girl Child. The day is designated to recognise girls' rights and the unique problems that girls face around the world. As we know, too many girls face discrimination and a variety of issues and challenges throughout the world and particularly in many developing countries; issues around violence, forced marriage, poverty and inadequate access to education. So many young women and girls experience these issues at the moment. It is a sad fact that more 60 million girls around the world are not in school, and over 100 million girls are predicted to become child brides over the next decade. Seventy per cent of the world's poorest people are females. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Day of the Girl Child seeks to focus attention on the need to address the challenges girls face and to promote the empowerment of girls and the fulfilment of their human rights. Right across the world the International Day of the Girl Child was acknowledged in many organisations and community events. One of these events is called Days for Girls. Days for Girls International is a grassroots non-profit organisation whose goals are to create a more dignified, humane and sustainable world for girls through advocacy, health awareness and education. Days for Girls International helps girls gain awareness and provides access to quality, sustainable feminine hygiene products, and also arranges the direct distribution of the kits, by partnering with non-profits, groups and organisations, and by raising awareness and helping communities around the world to start their own programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One such community that participated in this program was in the town of Murwillumbah in my electorate of Richmond. I was very proud to attend the local Days for Girls event at the Murwillumbah Community Centre and had the pleasure of officially opening the proceedings. About 80 people attended, and 45 kits were completed on the day, and the group is well on their way to achieving their goal of having 100 ready to send to Kenya and Nepal by the end of November. With these kits, girls in the developing world will have an opportunity to go to school, get an education and take part in society in ways that they could not before, due to lack of access to products like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Simply put, this initiative means that girls do not have to go days without school, days without income and days without leaving the house because they do not have access to these products. As it says on the Days for Girls International website:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It turns out this issue is a surprising but instrumental key to social change for women all over the world. The poverty cycle can be broken when girls stay in school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a fantastic global and local initiative, and I want to pay tribute to everyone who came along on the day to assist. I especially acknowledge the outstanding work of the Rotary Club of Mt Warning AM Murwillumbah for driving this project locally and organising this local Days for Girls event, which was part of the worldwide sewathon, which was held on October 11. To have so many people participating on the day was fantastic. People just turned up with their sewing machines, and away they went. They started making the kits. I commend this global initiative and I congratulate the Murwillumbah community for coming together to celebrate and highlight the issues around the International Day of the Girl Child.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We visited Bale Defence Industries, Birdon Marine and HF Hand, and we met with officers from Akubra hats up the road in Kempsey. We met with officers from Stebecraft in Taree and we visited many of their workplaces. I was already aware of their skill and innovation, but their capability in manufacturing complex defence equipment was the standout in the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence's visit.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Innovation and quality were the keys to their success, particularly the work that they do for the defence of Australia, whether it be for the fighting men in the military, the Navy or the SAS, the commandos or the US in the case of one that has just secured a $267 million contract to build boats for the US navy. I note particularly that all of these industries are employing local peopleâup to 100 between them. I do not have the exact figures, but they are all paying Commonwealth and New South Wales Treasury taxes, local government rates and taxes, and wages to their local employees. All of these local manufacturers experience what the whole of Australia is noticingâthat the globalisation of trade means that they have challenges that they have not had to face before. Many of the countries and business competitors do not have the same commitments to everything that Australian businesses have. For instance, many competitor countries have little or no occupational health and safety standards similar to ours, they do not pay land tax similar to us and they do not have the institutionalised WorkCover commitments, payroll tax or compulsory superannuation. A lot of the time they do not develop the product; they just copy it. They do not have the responsibility of annual leave of four weeks, let alone leave loading.</span>

If there are Australian-only competitors everything is neutralised, but there are different pressures that we put on ourselvesâin effect, reverse tariffs on ourselves regarding international competition. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  The coalition's first budget was a pretty cruel one, but there was one particular measure that continues to astound me for its cold-heartedness. The government's decision to stop funding the Youth Connections and Partnership Brokers program means that some of the most vulnerable people in our community will have the threads connecting them to school, work and a stable life completely cut away. In speaking with the providers of these services in my electorate of Fraser, I heard about a young woman named Sammy whose story highlights how important such a program is. Sammy came into contact with Youth Connections after a history of substance abuse and family breakdown which saw her drop out of school in year 11. The Youth Connections staff helped her find safe and stable housing, access much needed medical services and re-establish a relationship with her family. With these wraparound services supporting her, Sammy was able to go back to school to complete her secondary studies at the Canberra Institute of Technology and has gone on to further vocational study there. Sammy is one of the 93 per cent of Youth Connections participants nationally who remain in work or study six months after completing the program. I could also tell many stories about young people who stayed in school because of the Partnership Brokers program was able to link them to tailored vocational learning opportunities. These programs cost very little, yet they are enormously effective in helping young people build the foundations for stable, successful lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government is cutting back on these evidence based programs, it is expanding Work for the Doleâa program which an evaluation, commissioned by then employment minister Tony Abbott and written by Jeff Borland and Yi-Ping Tseng, found was increasing joblessness, not decreasing it. I urge the Abbott government to recognise the huge social value of Youth Connections and the Partnership Brokers program and commit the funding necessary to keep them running after 31 December.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my pleasure on Friday to attend an Anglicare youth unemployment forum discussing these very issues and to hear from experts such as Susan Helyar, Director of ACTCOSS, Anglicare staff such as Jenny Kitchin and Jeremy Halcrow, and clients such as Arko Chakrabarty, whose special song was a highlight for many. Anglicare workers such as Shy Watson, Sandra Mickie and Hannah McQuiggin were there to engage with the community, as was Claire Lloyd-Jones, the author of an important report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Limiting futures</span>, on the challenge of combating youth unemployment in the ACT. All of these people gathered together behind a shared goal: to increase participation in the ACT, based on evidence based policies, in order to improve the lives of young Australians. Yet all these people want is a government which is prepared to extend the same compassion to the community that so many great Anglicare workers exhibit every day in their daily work. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  A small country community in my Tasmanian electorate of Lyons believes in helping itself, even when the issue is the tough one of mental health. It was Bothwell nurse and farmer Anita Campbell who decided in July this year that something needed to be done to get her community talking about mental health. She enlisted the support of non-profit organisation Rural Alive and Well, led by the group's outreach manager, Wayne Turale, to plan a community event to promote mental health support services in Bothwell. Rural Alive and Well is ably supported by people on the ground, including Darren Thurlow and Garry Sharp, who do wonderful work in the southern part of my electorate. Mr Turale said that several unusual tragic events in the region in the past year had prompted a move to remove the stigma of mental health and get people talking about how and where to get help. Three people have taken their lives in the last 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The organisers hoped that 200 people would turn up to the event held last week at the Bothwell District High School gym. They knew they had judged the need correctly when a huge crowd, for Bothwell, of more than 300 people turned up to listen to various speakers provide information on mental health over a community barbecue. Anita Campbell believes that one of the main drawcards for the big crowd was the AFL star Brendan Whitecross, who plays for Hawthorn, who spoke about his own battles with depression. She said there were a number of young people from the district in the audience who really appreciated what he had to say. But the cross-section of older people at the event were also interested to listen to clinical psychologist from the University of Tasmania Jen Scott and the White Cloud Foundation director Marcus Pringle-Jones. White Cloud aims to provide education on helping people with depression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural Alive and Well counsellors like Wayne Turale say that, despite the considerable inroads made on the issue of mental health, there is still a stigma attached which is often worse in rural and remote communities. Anita Campbell suggested that mental ill-health had become an issue for everyone in the Bothwell communityâand I have heard that firsthand. Her plan is to start in the country area that she knows to lift the lid on mental health issues and then take it to other regional farming areas and urban areas around my state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To run the highly successful event at Bothwell last week, Rural Alive and Well secured a grant from Mental Health Tasmania and received strong support from Lifeline, Anglicare, the Bothwell football club and Westaway and Ellendale rural fire services. Rural Alive and Well is an excellent service, and 1300HELPMATE is the phone line. My thanks also to the board of Rural Alive and Well: President Ian McMichael, Vice President Dianne Fowler, Junior Vice President Leonie Young, Secretary Robin Thompson, Treasurer Bernie Harrington, and the many other people on the board who do wonderful work in their community supporting those with mental ill-health.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  Thanks to the hard work of advocates and service providers over a period of decades, the message is slowly starting to get out about men's violence against women. There is a growing recognition of the scale of this problem in our community and a growing appreciation that the root cause of this violence is gender inequality. There are men who believe that they are entitled to exercise power and control over the women in their lives and that society will let them get away with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as our society changes, the ways in which men can perpetuate this power and control changes too. Last week, a Senate inquiry into family violence heard evidence of how men are increasingly using technology to terrorise and control the women around them. WESNET, the Women's Services Network, told the committee how applications developed to help owners find lost phones can be used by abusive partners and ex-partners to track and target women. WESNET has also spoken about the ease with which men can acquire computer programs that can illegally access women's email accounts, spoof mobile phone numbers and even distort the voices of telephone callers. WESNET has responded to this by producing simple information for women on how best to protect themselves from online monitoring, stalking and harassment by partners and ex-partners. Their guides explain how these technologies work and how women can keep their movements anonymous using simple, preventative measures. It is a way to empower victimised women so that they can exercise control over their digital lives. I applaud WESNET for such an important initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But guides such as these can only go so far in protecting the women suffering from harassment and violence in our community. We need to see more action from government in this space to hold men accountable for this kind of behaviour and to empower women to take action on their own part. The lack of government action in response to the use of technology to threaten and stalk women contrasts with this government's actions to establish a children's e-safety commissioner to take down material posted to social media sites that bullies children and its proposals to block websites making available material that infringes copyright. These online safety and enforcement proposals obviously stand alone, separate to the use of technology to threaten and control women. However, the significantly higher profile that these issues attract in this place says something about our priorities as parliamentarians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that gender inequality is the root cause of men's violence against women, as recognised in the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022 in the Second Action Plan launched by this government this year, we need to start taking seriously the often toxic misogyny that women are frequently subjected to online. In our politics, our policymaking and our policing we need to start paying more attention to the growing use of technology by men to threaten and control the women in their lives. I hope that WESNET 's informed contribution to the Senate inquiry into family violence helps start this conversation, and I hope that today's launch of the Parliamentarians Against Family Violence group helps continue this important message.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  Osteoporosis is a common disease in Australia, with 1.2 million people estimated to have the disease. However, it is hard to put a figure on this because many people are simply unaware that they have low calcium density in their bones. Many remain undiagnosed until they start breaking brittle bones. It is suspected that there are a further 6.3 million Australians currently with low bone density on top of the 1.2 million known sufferers. In total, it affects one in four Australians, especially older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. In normal bone, remodelling occurs constantly. In fact, up to 10 per cent of all bone mass may be undergoing remodelling at any point in time. Osteoporosis occurs when this remodelling is incomplete. The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are: an inadequate peak bone mass, where the skeleton has suffered insufficient calcium when young; excessive bone resorption; and inadequate formation of new bone during remodelling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Several factors impact on this process including diet, exercise and hormonal issues. Calcium metabolism plays the most significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition. That is why a good, healthy diet including dairy products is essential, and that is why I say drink more milk and eat more cheese and yoghurt. Hormonal factors also strongly determine the rate of bone resorption. In women, a lack of oestrogen, perhaps as a result of menopause, increases bone resorption as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. In men, the male hormone testosterone helps maintain strong bones, so low testosterone levels can increase the risk of developing osteoporosis and breaking a bone. Men tend to lose testosterone as they age, and certain medications can affect testosterone levels. Almost a quarter of all people with osteoporosis are men. In both men and women, hormonal replacement can help prevent or treat osteoporosis. The other vital part of the answer is exercise. Load-bearing exercise like weightlifting is essential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can take simple steps to help maintain our bone health at any age. As I said, calcium, vitamin D and exercise are all important for maintaining strong bones. Almost 99 per cent of the body's calcium is found in our bones. It combines with other minerals to form hard crystals that give our bones strength and structure. Our most common source of vitamin D is sunlight. This is produced when our skin is exposed to ultraviolet B from the sun. It is pretty prevalent in Australia. We need to take osteoporosis seriously.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I rise to speak on the life of Len Buckeridge. Len Walter Buckeridge died in March of this year. He was born in 1936 in South Perth to Richard and Winnifred Buckeridge, and was the third of four children. He grew up in Rivervale and, later, Nedlands. He attended Perth Modern School and worked as a builder's labourer before graduating in 1959 from Perth Technical College with a degree in architecture. Len's thesis, <span style="font-style:italic;">The economical house</span> won the James Hardie prize for the best thesis prepared by a final-year student.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 1961 and 1978 Len designed and built thousands of mostly low-cost homes around Perth. In 1974, Len entered the project-building market to build low-cost detached houses. Now the sustainable home-building company that Len developed is one of Australia's largest home builders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Len established a window and door fabrication company. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Len established a plethora of construction materials and building products that manufactured and supplied products to BGC, other home and commercial builders, trades and the public. In 1996, Len established BGC Construction, a respected contractor whose projects include Perth Arena, Perth Police Complex, the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, the Pathwest Centre and the University of Western Australia science library, to name just a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Len created a vertically integrated group spanning quarrying, home building, apartments, commercial and institutional construction. The main reason Len built such a vertically integrated group was to remove costs from the supply chain, thereby make housing cheaper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1993, Len diversified into civil construction. BGC Contracting has delivered a range of mining and civil construction services across the resources, oil and gas, and government infrastructure sectors. BGC activities have spread to Queensland and South Australia, with offices in Perth, Brisbane and Whyalla, and depots in key regional areas. BGC Contracting has helped design, build and operate large mining and civil construction projects, including the South Middleback Ranges mine site, North-West Shelf LNG project, the aerodrome and railway infrastructure at Roy Hill, as well as Dyno Nobel's ammonium nitrate facility in Queensland. The group has built and manages a number of office blocks in Perth, including the 20-storey BGC Centre in the CBD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Len has been honoured by many awards for business: The Phil Lynch Award in 1993, the Homeswest industry award in 1993, the MBA Robert Law Award in 2001, and the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2003. </span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HYM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr IRONS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Crime on Perth's metropolitan train network has been a prevailing issue in my electorate of Swan, with violent and antisocial behaviour on trains, at stations and in surrounding areas such as car parks and the nearby streets making news headlines on a regular basis. Of all the train lines in Perth, the Armadale-Thornlie lineâwhich runs through Swan and the electorates of my colleagues the member for Canning and the member for Hasluckâis, however, without doubt, the worst, accounting for more than one in three assaults on passengers last year, according to Western Australian Public Transport Authority statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will take a moment to highlight that although this level of violence and antisocial behaviour on Perth's train network is confronting this should in no way diminish the significant funding for increased CCTV and lighting at train stations that has been dedicated by both the Western Australian state government and the federal government to improve passenger safety and police officers' ability to find and prosecute criminals. It should also in no way diminish the hard work of the transit officers who patrol PTA property. Although much work has already been done to combat this issue, I believe an alternative model based on Victoria's Parliamentary Service Officer Program should be trialled in WA to help reduce this level of crime. I recently met with the Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency Services Kim Wells to investigate how a similar PSO program could be trialled in Perth. I have since written to the WA Minister for Transport Dean Nalder to support its implementation under a similar legislative framework to Victoria's.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this investigation I have also been talking to residents on the Armadale-Thornlie line to hear passengers' perceptions of safety on Perth trains firsthand and will be distributing a survey to residents and business owners in Swan who live near one of the train stations on the Armadale-Thornlie line to seek additional feedback in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Victoria's PSO program, officers will patrol every metropolitan station and major regional stations from 6 pm until the final train, 365 days a year, once the program is fully implemented. PSOs also have increased enforcement powers compared to Western Australian transit officers, including the power to arrest people on outstanding warrants, and are also permitted to carry a firearm. According to the minister, the program has been successful in increasing the number of passengers utilising train services and their perception of safety. One example the minister gave was that, when people get off trains at night, they will congregate in an area and one of the PSOs will walk them out to their cars, which has made it a lot safer for passenger to travel on the trains. There has also been greater detection of crime on the network due to the increased presence of officers and the reporting of previously unreported incidents, with more than 29,000 infringement notices issued from the first deployment of PSOs in February 2012 to 31 March 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to compiling residents' feedback and discussing the implementation of the PSO trial in WA with Minister Nalder further in the coming weeks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes in a fair go for all, and in 1944 the Curtin government established the Acoustic Research Laboratory to look into the effects of excessive noise on military personnel. It was the last full year of the world war, and there was an attempt to look at the occupational issues that arise from military serviceâand we know that they are substantial. In 1947, the Chifley government introduced hearing services through that Acoustic Research Laboratory, and in 1947 it also expanded those services for children affected by the 1939 to 1941 rubella outbreaks. Since that time, for 67 years, Australian Hearing and its predecessors have been providing vital services to many Australiansâtoday some 450,000 Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was not something that was trashed by those opposite in those years; in fact, they built on it. In 1968, the then Liberal government expanded that service to include pensioners as well. That is a good thing: Labor had a good idea and the coalition built on it. Even John Howard, for all his many sins in this place, added to those services, because there is a distinct need in the community, and that need has to be met, and it can only be met by government services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Hearing provides those services to a diverse section of the populationâto the young and the old, to veterans and others. We know that without its supportânot just the services it provides but also the laboratory services, the testing and likewiseâmany people would not be able to receive this assistance. We know that groups like Deaf Children Australia talk about hearing impairments being barriers to personal development and social inclusion for children and young people who are either deaf or hard of hearing. It is obvious to all of us that, if you cannot hear, you really face an uphill climb in terms of learning and participating in society. When we had the recent week of activism, we certainly learnt that from some of the individuals who came up to Canberra to tell us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see here is not a sensible privatisation but simply ideology for ideology's sake. This is simply the government following the recommendations of its Commission of Audit. It put this Commission of Audit in place basically to evade its own election commitments. So we see the GP tax, the cuts to hospitals and the attacks on Australians on welfare, and now what we see is a totally unnecessary privatisation of what has for 67 years been an incredibly important service to pensioners and young people and, prior to that, to all those veterans after World War II.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that privatisation will disrupt the service. We know there is a great deal of uncertainty related to the scoping study that this government has imposed upon Australian Hearing. There is great uncertainty for the service and a great chance of a break and disruption in that service. Of course, we know who will suffer most. It will not be those in capital cities on high incomes, who can afford to buy services, it will be those in the outer suburbs, those in regional communities and those in remote communities in the bush. People who live in the suburbs of Warringah, Sturt or North Sydney will not be the people to suffer it will be those furthest from the GPO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just another broken promise by this government. Its schools policy said school children first. Its Indigenous election policy provided a better future, more job opportunities, empowered individuals in communities and a higher standard of living. This privatisation will undercut all of those commitments that were given by this government at the last election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is on an ideological crusade. There has not been a more ruthless, nasty commission of audit since Otto Niemeyer advised the government during the depression. We know what it has given us: the GP tax, cuts to hospitals and schools, attacks to welfare recipients, attacks now to the hearing repaired, devastating their services with a totally unnecessary privatisation, which will disrupt and damage services in what has been an incredibly important service for 67 years. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion and I thank the member for Wakefield for giving the House a chance to hear the Abbott government's track record in this important policy space and its determination for a strong, independent review process of the recommendations made by the National Commission of Audit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its creation in 1947 Australian Hearing has developed an enviable reputation for its work with hearing-impaired people. They are a trusted provider of high-quality hearing services, committed to access and equity, quality clinical care and excellence in customer service. Australian Hearing continues to perform strongly in a contestable and increasingly competitive environment, achieving a before-tax profit of $12.5 million in 2013-14. It is now one of over 230 registered hearing providers under the Australian Government Hearing Services Program and its research division, the National Acoustics Laboratories, is a world leader in hearing-loss assessment, prevention and rehabilitation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013-14 Australian Hearing provided 446,870 hearing health services to customers, almost 70 per cent of which were provided under the voucher program. It continues to build on its legacy with a greater focus on innovation and collaboration and is well placed to provide hearing services as policies, markets and technologies change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to recommendations by the National Commission of Audit the government announced a scoping study on future ownership options for Australian Hearing and funded this study in the recent budget. Following a competitive procurement process, PwC and Freehills were appointed to provide independent advice and recommendations around possible future ownership options to ensure the objectives of the scoping studies are met. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These objectives are to: maintain service at quality levels for customers and private investors, included in regional and rural Australia; ensure any recommended outcomes treat Australian Hearing employees in a fair manner, including through the preservation of accrued entitlements; minimise any residual risks and liabilities to the government; and maximise the benefit to the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scoping study will assess the capability and competition in the market and is intended to identify the most effective and efficient way of delivering services to the public in an evolving market. The government has not made a decision on the future ownership options of Australian Hearing and will not do what the member for Wakefield desiresâto confect the outcome before the results of the independent expert review are received.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Hearing's head office is located at the Australian Hearing Hub at Macquarie University, in my electorate of Bennelong. I have been fortunate to tour this unique, world-class facility that was purpose designed to facilitate collaboration and research into hearing disorders. Through its position within the hub, Australian Hearing maintains a strong connection to organisations like Cochlear, Siemens Hearing Instruments as well as academia and community sector groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday I was delighted to welcome the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health for a tour of Cochlear's facility next door to the hearing hub. This tour followed a government announcement a $538.8 million to help Australian health and medical researchers find the cures, treatments and medical devices of the future. The funding will support 773 National Health and Medical Research Council grants to ensure Australia remains a world leader in medical research. The tour also followed the Prime Minister's announcement last week of the industry and innovation competitiveness agenda, which Cochlear CEO, Dr Chris Roberts, stated 'would enhance their international competitiveness, cut red tape, grow their export capacity and streamline market access'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past few years, I have been campaigning strongly on a key plank of this agenda: the recognition of approval by trusted international standard organisations for medical devices. For Australian patients, this will facilitate the speedy access to the latest generation medical devices offered by Bennelong based companies like Cochlear, J&amp;J, Medtronic Australasia and St Jude Medical. To quote Dr Roberts, this is a huge win for an export company like Cochlear that sells devices into dozens of countries around the world that require country of origin approval. It means Cochlear is better placed to export its products, create jobs and improve health outcomes. It is clear that in 12 short months the Abbott government has taken strong action to support a competitive hearing services industry and find Australians in need of these health services. I again thank the member for Wakefield for giving us the opportunityâ</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  I too rise today in support of this motion. I commend the member for Wakefield for moving this motion. It is a vital service that Australian Hearing provides and one of great importance to the people in my electorate of Richmond. This motion really does recognise the outstanding work of Australian Hearingâand note it has been delivering these services since 1947.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I too have many concerns about the Abbott government's Commission of Audit recommendation that Australian Hearing be privatised. If this were to happen, it would be another cruel cut by this government to a vitally essential service. Privatising Australian Hearing will continue the attack on those who are the most vulnerable in our community. The fact is Australian Hearing is a government organisation that has been changing the lives of people affected by hearing disorders for decades. And it has been doing that by providing accessible affordable hearing care services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Hearing has a very long and proud record of providing these services and in making a massive difference in the lives of so many. It is a record it should be very proud of in changing those lives. It is a record of helping children hear their parents voices for the first time and a record of people helping elderly people enjoy a better quality of life. I hear that firsthand from people in my electorate. There is a very large proportion of elderly Australians who live in my electorate and they tell me how important Australian Hearing and the services it provides are. Australian Hearing's record is also about helping young adults to fully participate in the community and improve their job prospects because they are able to hear clearly. These are really important issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Hearing and the National Acoustics Laboratories play a significant and important role in providing world-class hearing services at a low cost to hundreds of thousands of Australians every year. And Australian Hearing has an internationally recognised reputation as a best practice government provider and research organisation. This record of achievement is now under threat because of the Liberal National parties' cruel budgetary cuts. But the fact is the government has absolutely no case for privatisation and has ignored the widely expressed concerns about risks to the quality and access of these services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commission of Audit review has led to this government allocating funds for a scoping study to investigate privatisation. This misguided and short-sighted decision has already seen more than $400,000 being spent on legal and business advisory services to privatise Australian Hearing. It really is an absolute disgrace that the government is spending this money to find a way to provide inferior services to Australians with hearing impairments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must reject the Commission of Audit recommendations to privatise Australian Hearing outright and instead guarantee that Australian Hearing, including its research division and the national acoustics laboratory, is to be maintained or, in fact, improved so that people can still access those services. Because moving to privatisation puts at risk the high-quality low-cost hearing health services provided to more than 450,000 people every year. Australian Hearing has 468 service centres and visiting sites, and many of those are in regional areas. On the New South Wales North Coast Australian Hearing service centres are located at Ballina, Tweed Heads, Grafton and Lismore. They are absolutely critical in providing hearing services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is those services in regional areas that make such a huge difference. People in these areas, particularly in mine, just would not be able to afford to access a hearing service if Australian Hearing were privatised. In addition to these service centres, in my electorate and throughout the New South Wales North Coast they also have a network of 10 smaller visiting centres scattered acrossâso that further extends their coverage to those who need the service their local community and to those who often are not actually able to travel to a major service centre. That is the issue when you are in a regional and rural area; it is often very difficult to access services. When you look at their website and see where they do go in the New South Wales North Coast, it is quite extensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Hearing provides an extensive array of services to young adults under 26 years of age, Indigenous Australians, former military personnel and elderly Australians with complex hearing needs. These are people who simply cannot afford the full commercial services for hearing tests, fitting hearing devices and some rehabilitation programs as well. Privatising the services will be devastating for all of those particular groups. If this does happen, it would just be another example of this government's cruel and unfair budget and also of their broken promises. We have seen it in so many areas, whether it is the aged pension, education, childcare assistance, the petrol tax or the proposed introduction of the $7 doctor tax. These are cruel and very harsh cuts. The privatisation of Australian Hearing on top of this would just be another broken promise and it would be devastating for those with hearing impairments. I condemn this government's plans to privatiseâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I rise today to speak to the motion by the member for Wakefield. In doing so, I want to acknowledge the important work done by Australian Hearing throughout our nation and the crucial service provided to children, young adults, Indigenous Australians and seniors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hearing loss affects one in six Australians and the numbers are growing. Detection and treatment can enormously improve the quality of life of those who suffer from hearing loss. In 2005, it was estimated that hearing loss cost our economy $11.75 billion dollars. This was mostly in lost productivity as people with a hearing impairment found it difficult to secure employment. You will get no argument from the government on the importance of hearing services and I will certainly not attempt to in any way diminish the value of the work being done by Australian Hearing. It is vital work. There are three Australian Hearing offices in my own electorate on the southern Gold Coast at Robina, Burleigh West and Palm Beach. I fully acknowledge the important work done at these offices and I thank the professionals who work for there for the assistance that they provide and the difference they make in the lives of those affected by hearing loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the member for Wakefield, I say I can wholeheartedly agree to certain sections of this motion about the importance of the service that is delivered by Australian Hearing. What I do find disappointing is the scaremongering that he and so many members on the other side of the House are engaging in. I want to make the point very clearly that the government has not agreed to the privatisation of Australian Hearing. What we have funded is a scoping study to determine exactly how effectively services are being delivered and whether there may be other models that could improve service delivery. It would be foolish to reject outright the recommendation of the National Commission of Audit, which was the first large-scale audit in 20 years of Commonwealth government activity. It is important to remind ourselves in the context of this debate of the commission's terms of reference which include to:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I know that many members opposite have a very irrational, emotional response to the suggestion that some government services could be delivered more effectively and efficiently. But on this side of the House, we take very seriously our responsibility to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely and that we get the best possible community outcomes for our investment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that a large bureaucracy and more money will result in better outcomes for the community is, quite simply, nonsense, but it drove so many of the policy decisions of the previous Labor government. As a result, government spending grew at unsustainable levels but problems were not solved. The classic example was the massive $17 billion wasted on school halls without literacy and numeracy levels improving at all. So it is a very poor intellectual argument when Labor members whip up a scare about particular services being cut and use emotive examples of people who have been helped to say, 'Look, these people would not have the help they need if there was any change in service delivery.' I can assure those listening to the debate that the government have no desire to cut services, and we are particularly mindful of the community service obligations we have to those who live in regional and remote areas. In fact, one of the objectives of the scoping study is to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ maintain service and quality levels for customers including in regional and rural Australia;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the member for Wakefield: instead of whipping up a scare, let's wait to read the findings of the scoping study and let's rationally analyse the findings of the government's response. The assumption in this motionâthat the privatisation of Australian Hearing will result in an interruption to service delivery and impact the quality of services and access to servicesâhas no factual basis. Let's keep in mind that many health and community services are actually provided by the private sector, with the government investing in the provision of those services to those who need it most, and especially those in regional areas. I have no doubt that, should a sale be agreed by the government down the track, we would go to great lengths to ensure an appropriate funding model is created in order to continue the availability of high-quality hearing services for all eligible Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  This is a terribly important issue and it affects over four million Australiansâhearing loss affects over four million Australians, and a full half of them are at working age. It would probably surprise you to know that, when you look at the employment statistics for people with hearing disabilities, males are 20 per cent more likely to be unemployed than the rest of the population; it is 16Â½ per cent for females. So we cannot underestimate the importance of this issue. Ours is a wealthy country doing very, very well in a whole heap of areas of providing health care and services for people who are less advantaged or have a disability, but it would astound you, I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, to know that 24 per cent of people who need a hearing aid do not have one.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the member for Wakefield on bringing this motion before the House, because the purpose of it is really quite transparent. It is to seek a champion on the other side of the House for Australian Hearing. The member for Wakefield, a champion in his own right, is willing to stand up here and say, 'We need to defend Australian Hearing services.' The member for McPherson has called us irrational or emotional. That is quite right: we are quite emotional about this because Australian Hearing was established by Ben Chifley in the immediate aftermath of World War II. There were lots of Australian servicemen coming back with hearing impairments. Combined with veterans and young people suffering hearing loss, something needed to be done. We could not, as those opposite have suggested, just leave it to the market. There was a clear need for Australian government intervention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an incredibly important service. It provides services from over 468 locations around the country. There are five in my own electorate, providing an invaluable service. A few weeks ago, I had the benefit of talking to the family of young Felix Williams. He is an infant receiving a cochlear implant and, since shortly after birth, has had the benefit of services from Australian Hearing in my electorate. His parents are very, very worried about the prospect of privatising Australian Hearing and they are encouraging us to take a stand in parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this debate, we have heard two speakers from the other side: the member for Bennelong and the member for McPherson. I see that the member for Ryan is going to speak on this issue. Maybe the member for Ryan will be the champion that we are looking for on the other side of the House to stand up for Australian Hearing, the staff who work there and the services that they provide to people with hearing impairment throughout the country. We call upon the member for Ryan to be the champion that this parliament needs on the coalition side of the House to stick up for Australian Hearing services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard speakers before such as the member for Richmond, a great champion for regional Australia, speak up about the importance of Australian Hearing in providing services to regional and rural Australia because this is an area where nobody seriously suggests that the market is going to provide a solution. And we already know that incomes are lower, distances are greater and all the other social disadvantages and health disadvantages are greater in rural and regional Australia. I am very surprised, astounded that we have not got a member from the Nationals standing here debating the importance of maintaining Australian Hearing. But they are missing. They are absent in this debate as with so many others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Australian Hearing does in the way it is able to provide bulk purchasing arrangements for hearing devices is something that will be lost if we contract it out or if we fragment the way the purchasing occurs in the audiometric market. What Australian Hearing does very well, apart from the great work of the National Acoustic Laboratory, is it provides as a bulk purchaser of the very expensive hearing devices.  I mentioned Felix Williams in my electorate. The cochlear implant is around $20,000 for one device. Australian Hearing, through its market interventions, is able to drive down the cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great pity that we do not have more time to speak about the impact this is going to have on Indigenous Australians. We already know that Indigenous Australians have chronic rates of hearing loss, up to 10 times higher than the four per cent of the non-Indigenous population that has hearing loss the World Health Organization classifies as a massive public health problem. So it is a great pity that we do not have more time to debate this as well. This proposition should be rejected. Those opposite should champion Australian Hearing.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  Australian Hearing has been catering to the needs of Australians with hearing problems since World War II and is still going strong despite the competition from other providers. With its associated research partner, the National Acoustics Laboratory, Australian Hearing is rightfully recognised as the No. 1 hearing service provider in Australia. Selling the government's share, as suggested by the National Commission of Audit, would not change the preeminent market position Australian Hearing currently holds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fact is the government has not made any decision on the future ownership options of Australian Hearing. As suggested in the National Commission of Audit Report, the government is investigating the possibility of privatising Australian Hearing and has taken on the recommendation of the commission to engage in a scoping study regarding this serious issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Hearing has stayed at the top of the hearing providers in Australia despite the fact hearing services have become subject to the issuing of a voucher which could be used by eligible people at any hearing service of their choice. This points strongly to the quality of the service and products provided by Australian Hearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the idea of privatising a government owned service can be a tough pill to swallow but there are other things to consider as part of this debate. Australian Hearing, according to the National Commission of Audit, holds a monopoly on certain parts of the hearing market. In our country, monopolies are illegal. Other providers are excluded from competing against Australian Hearing and this may well be inflating the price of those services due to lack of competition as the member for Throsbyâwho has now just left usâheard during the inquiry into IT pricing. As well as freeing up some of the $13 billion currently held in government assets, privatising Australian Hearing will lead to better value for money for the government as these services become cheaper by dint of competition for business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently one in six people, according to Australian Hearing, suffer some form of hearing loss. As our population ages and people are living longer, the government needs to consider how we can stretch our health dollar to benefit as many people as possible. Opening up those parts of the market which are currently protected is one way the government can get better value. This government is not proposing a stop to providing hearing vouchers to those who qualify for them. We are talking about allowing the market to do what the market does best and determine the price for those hearing related products. This is just common sense. Australian Hearing is in the strongest of market positions to continue to provide world-class services. It is doubtful that prices will rise, because there will be too much competition as less-established providers try to gain market share. As we saw in Queensland with the Newman government's successful introduction of dental vouchers, the pressure was taken off government-sponsored services as the private sector well and truly took up the slack once people could choose their own dentist, and the vast majority of these services were covered within the price of the voucher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Success breeds success, and Australian Hearing is a very successful business. Its profit last financial year was $12.5 millionâan increase of 297 per cent from the previous year. It is wrong that this or any government should own, fund and regulate Australian Hearing. The National Commission of Audit has made recommendations regarding several government-owned businesses, and Australian Hearing is just one of those businesses. It would be irresponsible for the government to ignore those recommendations and to not at least investigate the possibility of and potential for privatising Australian Hearing. With those comments, I reject the intent of this motion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am thankful for this opportunity to acknowledge the significant role that police officers play in our community, and the great deal of risk and sacrifice that comes with the job.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each year on 29 September thousands of people across Australia stop to pay tribute to the brave members of the police force who have lost their lives in the line of duty and to offer support to their grieving families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The camaraderie in the police force is second to none. That is why so many police officers and former members of the police force stop to remember their fallen comrades on 29 September. A death within the police force is a solemn reminder of the dangers our police face and the risks they must take every time they go to work to keep our communities safe. When an officer is killed in the line of duty, there is no telling how many police officers are affected from all over Australia. Many officers will reconsider the risks they take every day and the family members they would leave behind if something were to go wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent months, the dangers faced by members of our police force have only escalated. The risks faced by our AFP officers and Customs officials are becoming higher due to what is happening around the world and the possible threat to Australian citizens. The AFP continues to be concerned by the increasing risk of home-grown terrorists and the lone wolf/lone actor threat. This threat is intensified by the growth in self-radicalisation which is facilitated by new communication tools. We also have the joint counter-terrorism teams in each jurisdiction, comprising AFP, state and territory police, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation officers and members from other relevant agencies. The teams conduct investigations to prevent, respond to and investigate terrorist threats and attacks in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join the many people in the Macarthur electorate who have the utmost respect and admiration for members of the police force. These men and women take great risks every time they go out to work and they deserve much respect from the community for risking their lives to protect others. Macarthur has more than 300 police officers working in the Camden and Campbelltown local area commands, serving the local community. These men and women work very hard to fight crime and keep our residents safe. These officers serve our community with great integrity and honour. I hope that one day everyone will appreciate the sacrifices they make and the risks they take to protect us. It is not an easy job to do, and far too many officers have made the ultimate sacrifice and lost their lives doing it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unless you have worked in the police force or have a family member who does, it is hard to comprehend the dangers these men and women put themselves in every day to keep the community safe. In New South Wales alone, we have lost more than 240 police officers in the line of duty since August 1803, through a variety of causes. These include being shot by bushrangers, drowning while crossing a creek, being shot by an offender, being assaulted, and through injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents during pursuits. No matter how they died, it is terribly sad when men and women who have dedicated their lives protecting others are killed in the process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I would also like to pay tribute to the Police Legacy organisations across the country. Police Legacy is a not-for-profit organisation which provides emotional and financial support to the widows and children of deceased police officers. I would like to acknowledge the good work of the Police Legacy organisation that looked after the remaining loved ones of police officers who have been killed in the line of duty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My heart goes out to the families of all police officers who have lost their lives. I offer my heartfelt condolences. I believe it is important that we in this House continue to express our gratitude and reaffirm our support for the nation's 56,000 police officers, whose dedication and commitment ensure continuous peace and safety across our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all my colleagues from both sides of the House who have come together to support our fine police men and women in this place today. I am looking forward to the contributions from the member for Solomon, whose husband, Paul, is a serving police officer in the Northern Territory; from the member for Fowler, whose father was a police officer; and from the member for Richmond, who is a former member of the Queensland Police Force. I thank them all for their contributions today. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I second the motion. On 29 September I had the pleasure of attending a dusk service hosted by the Australian Federal Police to commemorate all of those officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty and to salute the courage of all those who wear a police uniform. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The dusk service was held at the National Police Memorial, which was officially opened in Canberra on 29 September 2006. This memorial pays tribute to Australian police officers who have been killed on duty or who have died as a result of their duties since the advent of policing in Australia. Importantly, the memorial recognises the unique nature of police service and the dangers that police face in the doing of their daily duties. Officers of our law enforcement agencies put their lives on the line to protect our communities every day. National Police Remembrance Day is a time to acknowledge the men and women of our law enforcement agencies who put their lives on the line to protect our communities, to secure our way of life and to ensure that we live safely today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Batman, police at Northcote Police Station were unanimous in their decision to honour the late Sergeant Brian Kilmartin with the Breavington Award, which was presented to his widow, Andrea, and sons Joshua and James, after a ceremony at All Nations Park War Memorial on 10 September this year. Sergeant Kilmartin was known for quietly going beyond the call of duty and it was apt that his service to the community was recognised. Northcote Police Senior Sergeant David Yates described the late Sergeant Kilmartin as a 'dedicated, kind and caring police officer'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Breavington Award for policing excellence is presented annually in memory of former Northcote police officer and World War II prisoner of war Corporal Rodney Breavington. Corporal Breavington was a Northcote policeman when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. He resigned immediately to join the Army, then aged 38, ending up in a workshops engineering unit of the 8th Division in Singapore. Corporal Breavington became the first Australian to be executed by the Japanese in 1942 during World War II, after escaping from a prison camp where thousands of allies were held. Acts of courage and strength characterised his last months. In Fairfield where he lived with his wife Margaret, there is a place called Breavington Park, with a playground, a memorial fountain and a plaque, saying he was described by his commanding officer as the 'bravest man he had ever seen'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately this year no Australian police officers were killed while on duty, but we will never forget and eternally honour the 757 Australian officers who have paid the supreme sacrifice. It is also important to remember the remaining loved ones of those killed on duty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Police Legacy started in 1971 when the Queensland Police Legacy was established. Today, the Queensland Police Legacy is an independent charitable organisation that aims to assist the families of all deceased police officers as well as the dependant children of terminally ill officers or officers who have lost a spouse. Since 1971 every Australian state and territory jurisdiction has created a Police Legacy of its own. Each Police Legacy essentially asks a number of questions, including what the officer who died would have wanted for their family and what opportunities they would have tried to give their children. The Legacy groups try to provide ongoing support to the families of police officers, and much of this work is done by volunteer staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank and commend all of those who serve in our law enforcement agencies and also their families and friends who support them in their duties.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  Firstly, I acknowledge the presentations by the member for Macarthur and the member for Batman, for their spirited responses to this National Police Remembrance Day. I also went to Inverloch on 29 September, along with a whole band of the community, representing the federal government with regard to what police officers do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I would like to make is that, unlike the member for Macarthur, I cannot identify with what a policeman goes through in their daily activitiesâhe said he left his family in the mornings in the full knowledge of what was ahead in the day but also having no idea of what was ahead in the day. We do not live that lifeâalthough perhaps we do in some ways: we have no idea what is going to come next! But there is only a handful of peopleâfive people, as the member for Macarthur point outâwho really understand what it is like to be a serving police officer. They are serving in this House today, or their parents were, or their husbands are or they have some direct connection to that. They understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, having said that, that does not mean we cannotâlocal, state and federal governmentsâenter into the remembrance day activities, which we all did. And I have done so for a long timeâespecially on award presentation daysâjust to recognise that which policemen and policewomen do in our communities. Quite often, they have a greater influence on young people than we ever envisage or realise. They are an inspiration: the lives that they lead and the pressures they are under are like those of the rest of us, but with that overarching responsibility they are given for our protection every day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ recognises and acknowledges the significant role that officers across Australia make to our local communities and the great deal of risk and sacrifice that comes with the job; â¦</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have heard the resolution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the selfless sacrifice of police officer Varli Blake stands out as a shining example of a young woman who gave her all for the job and who paid a very heavy price. Varli, who was a favourite netballer at Meeniyan Dumbalk United, and a student at Leongatha's St Laurence O'Toole's Primary School and Leongatha Secondary College, was seriously injured earlier this year when an explosion occurred in a flat in Middle Park after a leaking gas bottle ignited. Despite her ongoing rehabilitation, she could not wait to get back to work, calling hers 'the best job in the world'. Varli was not the only officer injured in the explosion. Sergeant Tony Scully and First Constable Emma Quick also suffered extensive injuries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of things have made Varli's journey remarkable. Aside from the resilience of a woman who suffered burns to 32.5 per cent of her body and who has endured extremely painful operations, countless physiotherapy sessions, speech therapy and any number of other obstacles on her way towards recovery, the resilience of the police force and the community that have rallied around her has also been part of the story and an inspiration to all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Varli's story says to me is how much the community values the contribution of our force and how worthy the force is to have a day in honour of those whose dedication and commitment ensure continuous peace and safety across our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the local police force back their own, as members in the House would understand, raising money to help her recovery. But the local communities in my electorate of McMillan have been just as keen to put their hands in their pockets to help, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. I believe that this is a testimony to what police and the job that they do mean to many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are few occupations where a real threat is faced every day, with absolute nil knowledge of what they may be walking into. That flat in Melbourne was just a routine event for these police officers. The person in the flat was known to them and they went in. And yet, the way the police force has rallied around these three has been magnificent. I would like to say to them, 'You are on our minds all the time.' We wish them a speedy recovery and want them to know that one day, with all those injuries, they will return to work. They will return to the Victorian police force, where they obviously have great dedication. But I could understand if they said, 'That's enough.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  Firstly, I commend those responsible for bringing forward this motion. We know that 29 September was National Police Remembrance Day. Services were held in my own electorate and across the Northern Territory honouring the eight members of the Northern Territory police who have died on duty since 1933, when Constable Albert Stewart McColl was speared during a murder investigation on Woodah Island. I want to reflect on the death of a very brave young manâand this was a matter raised during the commemorations this year in the Northern Territoryâthe death of Sergeant Glen Huitson, a man I knew. He died in a very sad event in 1999. He was at that time part of the two-man Adelaide River Station, 114 kilometres south of Darwin. He lived with his wife, Lisa, and their young children, Joseph and Ruby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Constable Jamie O'Brien, his fellow officer at Adelaide River:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Glen didn't like big cities and he had such an interest in the culture of Aboriginal people, he fitted right in â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The way he did things was very firmly but so fair it was like a basic transaction at a bank. Glen explained everything to them as it was happening and he never, ever gave anyone a raw deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As police officers in remote stations, Sergeant Huitson and Constable O'Brien were both mindful of being a long way from other police and support. On 3 August 1999 Sergeant Huitson and Constable O'Brien were already tired after attending a car crash the previous night when they were called to set up a road block on the Stuart Highway, in the early hours of the morning, north of Adelaide River. At around 10.30 am Sergeant Huitson and Constable O'Brien were shot at in an ambush. Constable O'Brien and Sergeant Huitson exchanged fire with the gunman from their position behind the police car at the roadblock. Sergeant Huitson was hit, causing grave internal injuries, and was killed. Constable O'Brien continued to fire at the gunman and as backup police arrived the gunman was ultimately killed himself. Constable O'Brien immediately ran to his dying colleague. Sergeant Huitson was pronounced dead soon after arrival at Royal Darwin Hospital. The memorial at Adelaide River for Sergeant Huitson says that he was 'an integral part of community life' and that his untimely death left a gap in the community 'which will never be filled'. Of course, that is a gap that will never be filled in the lives of his familyâhis wife and his two wonderful children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives us cause to think, as the previous member who spoke said, about the importance of acknowledging the dangerous role police perform in our community. They do not know what is going to happen once they walk out of that door at home to go to work. Anything could happen. I have had a lot to do with police over the years, and more recently with young police officers who are doing what I think is a bit of a sad job, in a wayâstanding outside of liquor outlets in the Northern Territory, and Alice springs in particular, where they have made a dramatic difference in the incidence of alcohol fuelled violence around the town. I think there should be other ways to do that. Nevertheless, I always stop and talk to the young coppers, just to say, 'G'day, how are you; what are you doing?' And I am constantly amazed by their dedication to the job, however menial or boring it might be at that particular time, and their commitment to making a difference.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is true across the police force, in all categories of policing. So I want to use this occasion to thank the Northern Territory police in particular, but also the Australian Federal Police, and the state police in the other jurisdictions, for the wonderful work they do. I know sometimes they get a bad rap, but let me say this: I could not imagine a more difficult job, particularly in the circumstances of remote parts of northern Australia, where it is particularly isolated and things are very rough. It is hard on families and it is hard on the police. But they really are a dedicated bunch and they deserve to be commended as we acknowledge those who have lost their lives in the course of duty over the many years since the police forces were established.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  It is with a great sense of honour and some sadness that I speak to this motion on behalf of the Brisbane Waters and Tuggerah Lakes local area commands and the wider Central Coast community. I thank my friend and colleague the member for Macarthur for bringing this motion before the House and I commend him on his 25 years service in the New South Wales Police Force. Since 1788 the men and women of the New South Wales Police Force have been protecting our homes, families, businesses and communities. The New South Wales Police Force has grown from the first civilian police force in Australia, known as the Night Watch, to one of the largest police organisations in the English-speaking world, with over 15Â½ police officers and around 4,000 civilian staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am fortunate to work with two local area commands in my role as the member for Dobell and two very impressive and dedicated local area commanders. Superintendent Daniel Sullivan, Commander of the Brisbane Waters Local Area Command, advised me of the significance of the National Police Remembrance Day. He said: 'As police, we choose a role in our community knowing that one day we may have to pay the ultimate sacrifice of fulfilling our sacred oath of office. Our families, however, do not get that choice. They live with the real fear that every time we say goodbye before heading to work it could be the last time we ever say those words.' The Central Coast, tragically, has three names on the National Wall of Remembrance. This is why Superintendent Sullivan supports and participates in fundraising activities for New South Wales Police Legacyâincluding walking to Tamworth, cycling to Canberra and, most recently, paddling the Brisbane Watersâto help those who are left behind after an officer has fallen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 September I had the honour of attending a memorial service to commemorate National Police Remembrance Day, which is observed in Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands. I joined with current and retired members of the New South Wales Police Force at Wyong Anglican Church to honour officers who lost their lives while performing their duties. We also paid tribute to those members of the police force who have lost their lives through illness or other circumstances. Superintendent David Swilks, Commander of the Tuggerah Lakes Local Area Command, said: 'This day is a solemn occasion where we take the opportunity to honour the selfless sacrifice of those who preceded us as well as those who have been our workmates.' Our local service was conducted by Reverend Dan Connor, New South Wales Police Chapman, Tuggerah Lakes LAC. He said: 'Professional policing is truly a noble vocation, a vocation that carries an inherent risk. We pause today to remember those fellow officers who gave their lives in their pursuit to bring justice to others. Their sacrifice was not in vain and will not be forgotten.' These words capture the significance of National Police Remembrance Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, in the past year no Australian police officer has lost their life on duty. However, we do pause to acknowledge the 757 officers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice and the countless others who have been injured. Every day, our police men and women put on their uniform, leave their loved ones and go to work knowing the tremendous risks associated with their job. They do it for the love of the force and the love of their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to acknowledge and pay tribute to members of the Central Coast police force who have lost their lives in the line of duty: Detective Sergeant Richard Whittaker, who passed away on 28 September 1991; Senior Constable Christopher Thornton, who passed away on 13 April 2001; and Senior Constable Peter 'Gordie' Wilson, who passed away on 11 November 2006. On behalf of the Central Coast community I thank these officers for their service and sacrifice. My thoughts are with their families and friends who carry with them every day the hurt of losing a loved oneâa father, a brother or a sonâwhile they were going about their everyday job and dedicated service to their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also commends the outstanding work of Police Legacy, who dedicate their time to supporting police and their families particularly in times of tragedy and need. In New South Wales, Police Legacy provides care and support to over 20,000 serving and retired police officers. Police Legacy cares not only for families who are suffering from loss and grief but also for those experiencing misfortune who may require extra support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I acknowledge the members of the New South Wales police force for their commitment and dedication to keeping our community safe and protection us from those who fail to respect the law. I commend the outstanding dedication and commitment of all Australian police officers, and the support provided by civilian staff, for their service and contribution to protecting our community. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                  <a href="008K0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I had not intended to speak on this particular motion, but I commend the member for Macarthur for it. The reason I am speaking on the motion is to do with events that occurred in my electorate on Tuesday, 23 September, when we almost lost two police officersâan AFP officer and a 'Vic Pol' officer. For me it absolutely drove home, in a very stark and brutal way, the difficulties that our fine men and women of the police force confront.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The event I am referring to was the stabbing of two police officers, on the evening of 23 September, and the death of the young man who was involved. It is not for me to make comments about what actually occurred there that evening, because that is the subject of a coronial inquest and an internal review. But I did want to say of the very fine men and women of the Endeavour Hills police force that under incredible circumstances, in unprecedented circumstances, in a local suburban police station, one that was relatively busy but is not a 24-hour police station, two young officers almost lost their lives in the course of their duties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often go to police functions and to police stations. There are three police stations servicing my area: Endeavour Hills, Narre Warren and Cranbourne police stations. When you meet with the young men and women, the senior sergeants and the force commanders, they will detail to you, as they have to me, the circumstances in which they find themselves. Often it will be attending an incident with domestic violence, where one of the officers gets injured as a consequence of their trying to intervene to protect a women or man who is being assaulted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we see these people driving around in our electorates and walking the streets, we do not appreciate the sacrifices they make to keep our community save. On behalf of my community I want to thank them. In the horrible events of 23 September, we almost saw something occur that resulted in the loss of life of the two young police officers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my honour to go to the station on two occasions on the Friday after the event. Incidentally, on 29 September one of the senior sergeants had to go to the National Police Remembrance Days service. While at the station I was fortunate to meet with a lot of the young officers and even some of the cadets who were there. I am hoping that they see this speech at some time, because I wanted to say this to them: you did well; you did very well; you did brilliantly. To contain the scene that was described to me was, under the circumstances, a great testament to the skill and resolve of the officers involved. The scene that was described to me was a horrific one, a harrowing and horrible scene. But those young men and women rose to a terrible situation, and we should be very proud of what they did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Macarthur for raising this particular issue. I want to say to all of those young men and women and all the officers who serve my area that I will remember you. This is not a situation where I am going to walk into your police station and talk to you. I will be there for you, because it is clear to me from meeting the very brave young men and women who attended the scene that there was significant trauma there for the officers. That is something we do not speak aboutâthe trauma they experience day in and day out that the community in a lot of ways takes for granted. We expect them to put their bodies and lives on the lineâand they doâto keep us safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of my community I thank you for what you doâfor putting your lives at risk. We know what the costs are to their personal relationships and to their health and wellbeing. Again, coming back to the point that hit me most viscerally, these were young men and women who were experiencing this. Congratulations to them and also to the two young officers involved. I will not forget you. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Thank you for the work that you do for our community.</span>

And, to this day, he is still a fierce advocate for the people of western Sydney.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like in particular today to thank the work of our local police in the Lindsay electorate, those from the Penrith and St Mary's local area commands. 29 September marked National Police Remembrance Day, a day we pause to honour police officers whose lives have been cut short while performing their duty. In this motion we also look at the work of Police Legacy that works with over 20,000 both retired and serving police. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1862, 252 New South Wales police officers have lost their lives in the line of duty while protecting the lives and property of othersâ252 lives lost way too soon. These numbers and sacrifices of our police officers were brought home to me by a very good friend of mine Brendan Bunter. Brendan was in fact my oldest brother's best friend going through school and, like his father, followed his dad into the police force. He served our local communities, including Fairfield, St Mary's, Katoomba and Mudgee, rising to the rank of sergeant. Brendan went to domestic violence incidents, including one where in fact an offender tried to stab and kill Brendan. Brendan now suffers with acute post-traumatic stress disorder and has had to endure the mental anguish that goes with that. Brendan has tried to take his own life. Along with his wife, I have visited Brendan in St John of God. When speaking to Brendan today about this motion, he told me that he would like to tell you of the challenges and the journey that he had been on. Whilst we might remember the 252 lives lost, if Brendan had have been successful in taking his own life, he would not be counted in those numbers, even though the post-traumatic stress disorder that he has following this particular domestic violence incident, the numerous motor vehicle accidents that he attended, the investigations into fatalities and assisting families through suicide has left Brendan with a permanent disability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brendan's wife is one of my very good friends and it is wonderful to see the support of the family. This is just one police officer; just think of the knock-on effect this has for all the other families. That is why this day of commemorating National Police Remembrance Day is so important. It is why it is important that we actually stop to remember and look at the sacrifices of all our local police officers. Once again, I have the opportunity here today to publicly put on the record and acknowledge the work of both Penrith and St Mary's local area commands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Friday also marked a very special day for Inspector Harry Goedings, who retired from the Penrith Local Area Command. Harry had served the New South Wales Police Force for 37 years and retires after a very long and distinguished career. On Friday he marched out of the Penrith station for the last time. He waved goodbye to his Penrith policing family, which I am sure he will be back to visit from time to time. Harry, I would like to thank you for your service, I would like to thank you for protecting our local community and I wish you all the best in your retirement. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we turn to National Police Remembrance Day each year, 29 September holds a very special significant for police right throughout Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and the Solomon Islands. It is a day for police to pause and honour officers whose lives have been lost whilst performing their duties. It is also a day for the general community to pause and thank those who serve in the police services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">National Police Remembrance Day was first held in September 1989 as a result of a joint decision at the 1988 Australasia and South West Pacific Region Commissionersâ Conference. It was a great decision to have this day. We see a number of police monuments through various states, and our national police monument well. It is wonderful to have that in place. It is located here in Canberra and was completed in 2006, with the names of 719 fallen officers inscribed on a wall of brass touchstones. The touchstones include the officers' ranks, names, jurisdictions, and places and dates of death. It is very important to have that national monument in place. Fortunately, this year no Australian police officer has been killed on duty. I think it is important to acknowledge that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the local commemorations, there was a very large event in my electorate. My electorate is on the border of Queensland and New South Wales and at Twin Towns they held a joint event with the Queensland Police Service and the New South Wales Police Service, as they do every year. I think it is fantastic to have such a large event that involves both states. The AFP were present, as were retired police. I am very pleased that my husband, Craig, was able to represent me at this combined service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, hundreds of police took part. They call it the Gold Coast-Tweed National Police Remembrance Day services. Officers from the border towns in both states marched and paraded through the streets to remember those 140 Queensland police officers and 252 police officers from New South Wales who have died on duty. They were all remembered in the very moving ceremony that many people attended. Of course, the thoughts of many of us are with the family of Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding, who was killed after responding to an armed robbery and hostage situation on the Gold Coast in May 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to touch on the great role that Legacy playâthis is in the original motion as wellâand to acknowledge that right throughout the country they do an outstanding job. The mission statement of New South Wales Police Legacy is: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That no widow, widower or child of deceased, serving, or former Police Officers will ever feel forgotten or in need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales organisation currently provides support for more than 1,300 police family members, caring for children as young as two, and some widows as old as 101. So that is a really remarkable achievement by Legacy. They also say on their website that their commitment is to build on the care and support of over 20,000 serving and retired police officers and their families during times of tragedy and need. They also say on their website:</span>

It is an opportunity for all of us to remember the very difficult work that is involved with policing, and the sacrifices that have been made by so many as well. I would like to thank all of those police and their families, particularly of course those in my electorate and those in the Tweed-Byron Local Area Command but the police right throughout the country, and their families as well.</span>

This morning I rise to support the motion of my good friend and colleague, the member for Macarthur. As a former police officer, he knows only too well the risks and sacrifices that our police officers face every day in their duty of protecting our communities. On Monday, 29 September, I was one of the many Australians who paused to reflect on the selflessness and bravery of our police men and women and, importantly, their loved ones. Along with many other members of the Darwin and Palmerston communities, I attended a service in Darwin to remember the service, dedication and sacrifice of our dedicated police officers. The date 3 August 1999 is still fresh in the minds of many Territorians, who will always remember the ultimate sacrifice made by Glen Huitsonâ</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">National Police Remembrance Day is 29 September. It is observed on Saint Michael's Day, Saint Michael being the patron saint of law enforcement and, according to Christian tradition, the protector of good over evil. Since 1989, it has been one of the most significant days on the national police calendar. It is a time when we pause and honour lives and the memories of some very fine men and women whose lives were drastically cut short in the line of duty. But National Police Remembrance Day is also a significant opportunity not only for police but also for the general community to reflect upon the invaluable service rendered by our police officers and to express our gratitude for the significant work they do on behalf of our respective communities. We all know that policing comes with a very high degree of risk that thankfully most of us will never have to face. It truly takes a special type of person with a special type of courage to wear the police uniform. We are truly indebted to the men and women who choose to do so. The bravery and courage of our police men and women and their dedication to serving and protecting our communities should never be taken for granted. We are forever in their debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On National Police Remembrance Day we also think of the loved ones left behind, whose lives have been affected forever. We owe it to the fallen to ensure that their families are well protected and provided for. I know Police Legacy, particularly in New South Wales, where I come from, does a splendid job. I also know that it is replicated in each of the other states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the inaugural Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance in 2010, I have had the honour of joining the police commissioners, officers and friends of police, riding our motorcycles from the police memorial in Sydney to the national police memorial in Kings Park in Canberra. By the way, this year the theme of the ride was Remembering Mates. This year we had the largest number of riders participate. We had over 1,800 motorcycles turn up for that event. I congratulate Mark Burgess and the Police Federation of Australia on a most successful event. I would also like to particularly acknowledge the contributions of Assistant Commissioner Mick Corboy and Senior Sergeant Paul Bousfield, both with the New South Wales Police Force; retired Inspector Brian Rix from Victoria Police; and the chair of the organising committee, Senior Sergeant Brayden Murphy of the Queensland Police. I would also particularly like to thank ACT policing and the respective government departments in the ACT for allowing the ride to assemble in Northbourne Avenue and to proceed around Parliament House before arriving at the National Police Memorial in Kings Park.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This ride is a major charity fundraising event. The funds raised will go towards Police Legacy, who support the families of officers who have been killed on duty. It was a most successful event and, as a result of this year's ride, the Police Federation of Australia will be donating over $100,000 to the Police Legacy fund. This brings the total amount of donations by the Police Federation of Australia to Police Legacy since the inaugural ride to over $400,000. I think that shows the amount of support to Police Legacy, who in turn ensure that young people and their families are provided for into the future. This was an opportunity for all of us to show not only our respect for those who have lost their lives in the service of their duty but also acknowledge the extraordinary contribution that police make day in and day out and to show our gratitude for their efforts on our behalf.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  No-one on our side of the House would have been surprised when one of the very first acts of the Abbott government was to abolish Labor's low-income superannuation contribution and to decide to further delay the lifting of superannuation contributions from nine per cent through to 12 per cent, extending it, at least, through to 2025. Despite the pre-election promises by those opposite, particularly by their leader the Prime Minister, that there would be no changes to superannuation arrangements in Australia, the Prime Minister did not waste any time before making an assault on superannuation and the provisions that are enjoyed by workers in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This backflip did not surprise many of us. Those on the government benches at the moment should know their history, that they have been enemies of superannuation for workers in this country right from the start. On the other hand, superannuation is one of Labor's key achievements. We on this side of the House can be proud of our history when it comes to superannuation and looking after workers. Labor had the guts to do the right thing more than 30 years ago, at a time when the only people who had superannuation were, in the main, public servants and those in white-collar management positions in the private sector. It did not apply to workers generally and it certainly did not apply to blue-collar workers. I know that the trade union movement pursued superannuation throughout the mid-eighties. It was then being developed and was known as award based superannuation. But it was contained to those organisations or those workers who were covered solely by awards. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took a Labor government to legislate to provide for compulsory superannuation to all Australian workers. Those opposite were opposed to this. They actually voted against it. They opposed the notion of compulsory superannuation. The idea of saying no to workers' savings and to compulsory retirement provision for workers is not totally foreign to those opposite. Remember that it was Labor again that legislated to put in place a gradual increase of employer contributions to superannuation from nine to 12 per cent, with the 12 per cent to come in at 2019. That was to give rise to the initial intent of the provisioning of retirement savings to all Australian workers when it was first developed almost 30 years ago, and that was to lift it to 12 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of what has occurred under this government, we saw superannuation rise to 9.25 per cent in 2013 and it has now risen to 9.5 per cent, and there it is going to pause. As a result of the Prime Minister's broken promise, it will stay now at 9.5 per cent until 2021, and that is going to put back the reaching of the intended 12 per cent to at least 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to freeze the superannuation guarantee will make it increasingly tough for those that are going to be retiring, particularly those that are low-income workers. There are 3Â½ million that would be classified in this country as being low-income workers, many of whom reside in my electorate. This is of particular concern for women, and with the continuing gender pay gap women will simply not have enough money to retire. In fact, as many as two-thirds of those affected by this government's decision are women. Everyone knows that, unfortunately, because of the nature of women moving in and out of the workforce, mainly due to having a family, this is going to leave them significantly worse off than any other group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you consider that in relation to the withdrawal of the low income superannuation contribution, it further compounds the position of women. Superannuation is a vital scheme that provides benefits for all people retiring, and it should allow people to retire with dignity. What this government is choosing to do is abhorrent.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  This entire motion shows the complete economic illiteracy of the opposition. They believe in magic pudding economics. I am sure we have all read the story of the magic pudding with Bunyip Bluegum, Bill Barnacle and Sam Sawnoff and the pudding thieves and of how the magic pudding would reform itself every time they would eat it and they could eat it again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The obvious thing they seem to completely fail to understand is that if you increase superannuation that money has to come from somewhere, and, as your current leader said, the increase in compulsory super comes out of people's wage rises. So it simply means that if you have a compulsory increase in super that means that real wagesâwhat people get in their pocket and what they take homeâbecomes lower. That may well work when the economy is growing, when the budget is in surplus, when we do not have a national debt costing $1 billion a month in interest repayments alone. When those things are happening, yes, you can compulsorily take some wages from the workers and compulsorily put that into superannuation. But we do not have that now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question that I ask my good friend, the member for Fowler, is: would a typical constituent in his or my electorate that might have a current credit card debt on which he is paying 17 per cent interest be better off getting extra money in his pay and paying down that 17 per cent interest rate or having that money compulsorily taken out of his pay, given to the superannuation funds and invested where he might get three or four or five per cent. Or take the young couple with a child who are struggling to get a deposit together so they can take a mortgage on. What would be best for that young couple? Is it best to have more money in their pocket to help them put together that deposit, or to take that money off them, put it in their superannuation account and tell them they can have it at 65. Or take someone that is a worker who decides they want to have a go by themselves and decides they would like to start their own small business and wants to scrape together a bit of capital to start that business up. How would they be better off?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Would they be better off with money in their pocket today to go an invest in that start-up business or would they be better off with the government compulsorily taking that away and putting it in their super funds? The answer is simple. No-one, with the changes we are making, will be worse off. Workers will have the right, if they think they would be better off putting more money into their superannuation from their wages, to do so. If they think that they would be better off paying off their credit card or putting that money towards a deposit on a house or putting that money towards scraping up the capital to start a small business then that is what we are allowing them to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the member who moved this motion was not part of the previous six years of mess and chaos that many of us here experienced. If that member was, she would know about the unexpected negative changes and about the complete hypocrisy of that motion. It was under the previous Labor government that we saw $9 billion worth of unexpected tax increases raiding the superannuation accounts of the people of this nation. And they come in here crying crocodile tears pretending that the workers are going to be worse off because we are giving them the choice to either increase their superannuation if they want or to put that money into a real wage increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing on the subject of superannuation, which seems to have gotten not a lot of front page recently, is the Future Fund. Thankfully, we now know there is $100 billion in the Future Fund that Peter Costello set up when he previously paid off that $96 billion worth of Labor's debt and started those surpluses rolling in. He put that money away to account for that unfunded superannuation liability. But in the last budget that unfunded superannuation liability has now blown out to $150 billion. It still has to be paid sometime in the future. The budget estimates that by 2020 that will be $200 billion and by 2050 it will be something like $350 billion. If we are to be honest with the Australian people, we need to fully account for all of that unfunded superannuation and the liability this government has going forward.</span>

                  <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I would like to begin by thanking the member for Griffith for this motion on a subject that is very close and dear to my heart. Superannuation is important for all Australians but I am here to tell you why it is particularly important for women. Women live longer than men but earn less; they take more time out of the workforce and they retire with less superannuation. Significant and increasing numbers of Australian women are ending their working life facing financial hardship even poverty and, in some cases, homelessness. Their future is bleak and I meet them in my electorate office almost every week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian women are earning less today than they were ever before when compared with their male colleagues. According to ABS data from August, the gender pay gap has soared to above 18 per cent. The data shows that male salaries have increased by 2.9 per cent while, alarmingly, women's salaries have only gone up by 1.9 per cent. Men, on average, earn a full-time weekly wage of $1,559.10; women, on average, earn $1,275.90.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women need more support. The Prime Minister's broken promise on the superannuation guarantee means women will retire with thousands of dollars less in their super accounts. This broken promise would leave people worse off, it will hurt young people and it will hurt women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you about how superannuation could have helped my family. When I was 11, my father walked out on my mother, two sisters and me leaving $30 in the bank. My mother was a determined stay-at-home mum having been a victim of the marriage ban and two generations of poverty. Her father had also walked out on her own mother just six months after she was born. She was brought up in a housing commission home and her mother worked three jobs as a domestic to keep food on the table. My grandmother had done it tough all her life. Her own father had also disappeared during the course of her childhood leaving her mother, my great-grandmother, with 13 children to bring up on her own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was the first person in my family to go to university. My middle sister was the first scientist, and my little sister was the first doctor. My mother was determined for us to have the choices that were denied her, which education provided, and she dedicated all her spare cashâand in the end a comfortable retirementâto make it happen. Because of my mother's part-time work and then late entry into full-time work and superannuation, she retired with just $20,000. And because she was involved in the early days of superannuation, a lot of that tiny sum of money was eaten away by fees. So, now my mum is on the pension, and until last year she was cleaning houses and house sitting for extra cashâat 75. My mum is too proud to take money from my sisters and me, so we support her by paying for her holidays, her private health insurance, and her theatre tickets, airfares and dinners out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Canberra I see women with similar stories to that of my mother and similar financial situations every dayâwomen who are the victims of domestic violence, sleeping in their cars with their teenage children; women who are on their own, with small children, in search of social housing and financial assistance; women who are on the pension and still renting in the private market, which I see all the time; and desperate women in their 60s who are finding it hard to get work but need to keep working because they do not have enough for their retirement. I am calling on the Prime Minister to set up a system that gives these womenâwomen like my mum, women like the women in my electorate, and their daughtersâsome financial security. The decision to delay the superannuation guarantee until 2025 will have the biggest impact on those who can least afford it: the low- and middle-income earners, and mostly women. The abolition of the low-income superannuation contribution will rip up to $500 a year from 2.1 million women on low incomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister claims that the money will be in people's pockets, not locked away in super. But are these workers going to see an increase in their pay now that they are not getting an increase in super? Of course they are not. The Prime Minister promised no adverse changes to superannuation, and he lied. The Prime Minister said that no-one will go backwards, and he lied. Australian women should not have to pay the price for the government's poor choices and should not have to face a bleak retirement future because of the Prime Minister's broken promises.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Griffith for giving me the opportunity, in bringing this motion to the House, to clarify that our plan for greater stability and certainty to superannuation is exactly what this government was trying to achieve. In short, we are keeping our election commitments. However, we do acknowledge that there have been some adjustments to the time frames in which these commitments will be met. The motion by the member for Griffith states that there will be a greater level of uncertainty with regard to superannuation as a result of these changes. But I would like to say that this will actually add certainty to superannuation, because it was the previous government, in its term in office, that created enormous uncertainty within the superannuation system. And if it was not for Labor's continual frustration at the government's clear mandate to repeal all manner of ill-conceived Labor Party policiesâfor example, the mining taxâthen the changes the government has had to make may not have been necessary, as the mining tax package initially sought to remove some of the enormous amount of expenditure tied to it that is now being blocked.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worthwhile remembering that during Labor's time in office Labor announced increases in taxes on superannuation of almost $9 billion. They also succeeded in cutting superannuation benefits for low-income earners by more than $3.3 billion. I note with interest that there is no reference to any of these adverse effects to superannuation in the motion of the member for Griffith. It is typical of those oppositeâthe crocodile tears over changes to try to not only get the budget back into order but also get this economy back into shape after six years of their negligence and mismanagementâthat the changes we seek to make for everybody's benefit over the longer term are blocked by those opposite, including changes that were previously Labor Party policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mandatory requirement for employees to put superannuation into people's accounts has come from forgone pay rises and even the current Leader of the Opposition noted that in a speech recently. In addition, it is important to remember that this is a minimum mandatory requirement. If people want to trade off pay increases or more pay they are free to put more money into their superannuation via salary sacrifice, for example. There is nothing to stop them doing that. However, those opposite did succeed in reducing the ability of people on significant incomes to put significant amounts of money away for their retirement via larger superannuation contributions. Previously, we had contribution limits for concessional contributions of around $50,000 if you were under 50 and $100,000 if you were over 50. They are now down to $30,000 and $50,000 respectively. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that prevents the people who are most capable of putting significant amounts of money into superannuation from doing so to minimise the need for them to draw on the age pension in their later years. So I do not in any way support the motion put forward by the member for Griffith, because it is only through the actions of this current government that we are looking to provide some stability, some certainty in the superannuation system in order to also bring the budget back to order and to ensure that people have employment and jobs, and to get our economy back on a sound track not only for the current generations but for future generations of Australians. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Julie Bishop, Australia's foreign minister, will tell you that Fiji is a critical economic, transport and political hub in the Pacific, and that it plays a natural leadership role in the region. A thriving and prosperous Pacific will not be complete without a thriving and prosperous Fiji. In short, it was important to all of the nations in the Pacific, including Australia, that this election was a success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was invited to co-lead the multinational observer group, MOG, with Indonesia and India. Being part of this election was one of the most gratifying things I have done as a member of parliament. We were part of an accredited group of observers from the host nations, along with Canada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, the Melanesian Spearhead Groupâwhich included Vanuatu and the Solomon IslandsâNew Zealand, Korea, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the USA. In all, there were 92 of us and we attended just over one-third of the booths in operation on the day of the electionâall across the many islands of the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a country which had not had an election in eight years. Eight years ago, the voting age was 21. This time around, the voting age was 18. Still, many people, just under the age of 30 would be having the first democratic vote of their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The enthusiasm shown by the voting public was overwhelming. As we travelled around Nadi, both in town and way up in the hills in the very small villages, the feeling was the same. They all wanted this and they were proud to be taking part in their own history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people were ready early and stood quietly, in the sun, dressed formally to exercise their vote. The booth workers were incredible with their diligence to the task at hand and their attention to detail. When we finished, at around 11.30 pm, some of these booth workers had put in days of over 18 hours and still had smiles on their faces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work in creating the new voting system was no mean feat. The pressure on the Fijian Electoral Commission was huge. The targeted assistance by the brave and hardy band of Australian public servants who went over to help must never be underestimated. We did not take over; nor did we perform some form of big brother role. Our public servants worked side by side with one goal in mind: the return of full democracy to this great Pacific nation, so that this would be the first of many elections and Fiji would prosper because of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people were worried that it might be cancelled at the last moment, and many were worried that the result could be fixed. From what I sawâobviously, the election was not cancelledâthe work of the booth attendants was absolutely first-class. They knew that if they did their job very well their nation would benefit. Not one booth worker I saw during that very long day was slacking off. They did not want a failure of this to be sheeted home to them personally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Howard would always say that the electorate always gets it right. To all involved I say: thank you and congratulations. To the hardworking staff of the Australian High Commission and the MOG I say a tremendous thank you and congratulations. The work they did in the lead-up to this over months and months was no mean feat. We had to make sure that this thing was going to be a success. The MOG was based in Suva and we travelled across the country. Some of us went to islands. Some of us went to other parts of the main island. But, to a person, we came back and, whilst you could nitpick on certain things and you could always pick holes in someone's arguments, there was a general consensus that this was hugely successful. And, for a first election, it was tremendously successful. The people involved should be very proud. Even more proud should be the people of Fijiâthe way they turned up; the way they had their voter cards; the way, as they travelled about the next day coming back to Suva, everyone would show their finger where it was inked to show that they had in fact votedâthat they had participated in it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was only one error in the entire time, and that really was not the fault of the Australian High Commission; it was actually ex-Senator Russell Trood who threw out the mathematics, leaving one particular member stranded at the hotel instead of getting to the airport on time. The member for Greenway will go down in history as the one they left behind! But it was very comfortable in Fijiâvery comfortable indeed. So, to everyone in Fiji: we hope we will be back, and I say, 'Sola tale nima taha.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I am pleased to add a contribution to this important motion congratulating the Fijian people on the elections that were held on 17 September this year. A number of us were fortunate to be part of an observer mission to view those elections and to play a role in this vital step that Fiji has taken on the path back to democracy. The successful and well-run elections on 17 September were an important first step on that path back to democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The relationship between Australia and Fijiâand, indeed, other nations within the Pacificâis a very important one, and many of the Pacific nations have been willing Fiji back to democracy through a democratic election process. Fiji is of course the headquarters of the Pacific Islands Forum and a key economy in the Pacific. Historically, it is a nation that Australia has had very proud and long-lasting ties with. So it was pleasing to see that Australia played one of the leading roles as part of the Multinational Observer Group. That group was made up of representatives of 15 nations who did their best to cover most of Fiji and observe the process of the elections and ensure that they ran smoothly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate and thank all of the nations that made a contribution to the process of the multilateral observer group. In particular, I think Australia can be very proud of the role that our bureaucrats played behind the scenes in working with the people of Fiji and providing advice to Fijian officials on how to conduct successful elections. That process was led by Andrew Goledzinowski from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who did an excellent job in the lead-up to the elections and in working with the Fijian government and officials on the process and the multilateral observer group. We also pay tribute to Glen Miles, the Acting Australian High Commissioner in Fiji, who has done a very good job under difficult circumstances over recent years. Glen has been acting in that role because the Fijian government has not granted agrimont to our proposed High Commissioner, Margaret Twomey, and hopefully that issue will now be resolved given that Fiji has held successful elections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate to visit Labassa, a rural city on the northern island of Venua Levu. It is sugar cane territory in the grips of a severe drought. On election day, my colleagues and I observed the people of PNG come out in force. They were very excited and proud to have a say in their future once again. Despite the very complicated electoral process, we observed that the process ran quite smoothly. I must say that the result was broadly representative of the will of the Fijian people. But, as we all know, there is more to democracy than simply holding elections. In the wake of the 2006 coup, there was a military crackdown on dissent within Fiji. The media was heavily censored. I recall reading newspapers in Fiji where whole pages just had the word 'Censored' across the otherwise blank pages, because of the operation of the media decree. Freedom of speech was restricted and political campaigning was very much restricted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully I observed on my second visit to Fiji in the last 12 months that things had improved. That is good, but there is still a way to go. The next period for Fiji is crucial. The parliament must be convened and the government must grant priority to establishing orders of the parliament that are transparent, accountable and provide faith for the Fijian people in the process of decision-making and law-making. That includes such things as freedom of information laws, abolishing the very restrictive media decree and removing restrictions on candidature for people to run in elections. Despite all of that, I think Fiji is on the right path. I am very proud to have played a role in the Fijian elections, and certainly the Labor Party looks forward to working with the people of Fiji in restoring democracy once and for all.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I am very pleased to speak in support of this motion by the member for Herbert. Australia played an important role in the Fiji election as co-lead of the Multinational Observer Group, known as the MOG, together with Indonesia and India. The MOG comprised 92 observers from 15 countries and organisations: Australia, Canada, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Melanesian Spearhead Group, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the USA. Having served in the Australian delegation to the MOG, led by former minister Peter Reith, it was indeed a very rare and personal privilege to bear witness to a nation returning to democracy after a period of military government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has such a long and proud history of stable democracy. We sometimes take for granted our electoral rights and responsibilities. To see the Fijian people embrace this opportunity was extremely heartening and a reminder of the duty we all bear as elected representatives. The MOG did not run the election, nor were we there to be political commentators, but our observations were extensive, involving a lot of consultation with all sectors of the community in the lead-up to the election and particularly on election day. On election day, 17 September, members of the MOG visited 455 polling stations, which was around 31 per cent of the total number of polling stations. We took our responsibility seriously and we even had our own discrete tally room to ensure that the results posted matched what had been observed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While a full report is due next month, the provisional statement made on 18 September found that the Fijian elections had been credible and that the conditions were in place for Fijians to exercise their right to vote freely and the outcome was on track to broadly represent the will of Fijian voters. It is worth noting that Australia, as well as co-leading the MOG, was also an important practical supporter of Fiji's election preparations, including providing six Australian election experts to work in the Fijian elections office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to office, our government has taken a leadership role in normalising relations with Fiji within the region. As far back as late last year, the incoming government announced a new policy of enhanced engagement with Fiji, centred on increased cooperation in political and economic relations. Australia's conciliatory role earlier this year included working constructively towards democracy through the Pacific Islands Forum Ministerial Contact Group. I congratulate the foreign minister on her leadership and her understanding of the way to achieve democracy in Fiji through respectful negotiation and discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate Prime Minister Bainimarama on both his election win and his decision to entrust the people of Fiji with the right to determine their destiny. Without raking over the history of the military coup, it is sufficient to say that few people in such positions of power relinquish control willingly. It is a measure of his regard within Fiji that his Fiji First Party received a resounding majority of the voteâaround 59 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are still many challenges to be faced when it comes to building a new parliamentary culture. Early judicial decisions taken on constitutional issues will help determine the success of the new system, and the degree of confidence the Fijian community has in it. As Peter Reith, our delegation leader, put it recently: 'Needless to say, democracy is not a one-day wonder. Fiji will need to continue and improve the practice of democracy.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is early days, but Australia certainly stands ready to work with the Fijian government to meet any challenges and to build on the very strong relationship between our two nations. It is worth noting that 300,000 Australians visit Fiji every year. In fact, Australia is the largest source country for Fiji's successful tourism industry. Further, Australian trade with Fiji is worth $2 billion every year and Australia is the largest foreign investor in Fiji. There are also around 50,000 Fijian nationals living in Australia. So the ties between our two nations are undeniably strong. We both play a vital role in the region and a harmonious and constructive relationship is in both our interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a moment to thank Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff, led by observer coordinator Andrew Goledzinowski, who supported not only the Australian participants in the MOG, but all 92 observers. I also acknowledge the staff at the Australian high commission, led by Acting High Commissioner Glenn Miles. Finally, it is the Fijian people themselves who deserve our congratulations, respect and admiration for the way they conducted themselves and for the enthusiasm they displayed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="159771" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  Fiji is my ancestral home. My mother was a descendant from the island of Bau, the royal island. It was quite momentous for me to visit Fiji for the first time, to watch in great anticipation as a member of the Multinational Observer Group for Fiji's election day and to see the sun rise over the bay in Levuka on the morning of polling day, Wednesday, 17 September. I was deployed to the island of Ovalau as part of the MOG 42 team, which included Wyatt Creech, former deputy prime minister of New Zealand, Sandra Kraushaar, the Australian liaison officer, and Aisake Rasalala, our driver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure it could be said for any number of beautiful places in Fiji, but I think that, if you had only 24 hours in that country, circumnavigating Ovalau would give you a fantastic insight into Fiji and its people. Even on Natovi jetty, waiting for the ferry on the afternoon before, which was running on island time, we had the opportunity to speak to lots of locals. There was great enthusiasm. Many were in their late 20s and had never voted before and were relishing the opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we were briefed on before our departure, however, there was an air of distrust in society. The night before the election, in Levuka, we were talking to some Fiji nationals originally from the United Kingdom. A man named David, who had made Fiji his home, said, 'Sure, we will queue up tomorrow morning, but what happens in between my vote going into the ballot box and that box making its way to the counting station in Suva?' We explained that, unlike in previous elections, this voting was occurring on one day only. The count would be conducted at the venue and the results posted outside. And there David was, queued up at 7 am the next day at Levuka town hall. We covered around 12 polling boothsâjust about all of them, I believe, on the island. Many of these, as I am sure my colleagues in the MOG would attest, were small villages, such as the village of the Lovoni, which was in the centre of Ovalau. In order to get to this polling place we literally had to climb a mountain, and one side of the mountain was on fire! It was no mean feat that we managed to not only make it to that booth but to also observe the absolute professionalism of the Fijian officials who were conducting and overseeing that booth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our day started well before 7 am at the Levuka town hall, and the day ran so smoothly from that point onwards. As I said, it was an absolute tribute to the Fijian people. Most people voted early. It was a public holiday, so from about lunchtime some of those booths had very few or no voters at all; however, those officials held their posts. They did not leave; they did everything in accordance with exactly how they had been trained. I want to place on record how professional the local polling staff were at each booth we visited. They were dedicated; they found workarounds. They found a way for everything, from bringing their own chairs to the care they took of voters, especially older voters, many of whom had eyesight issuesâunfortunately, this is very common in some parts of Fiji. They would bring them a table; they would bring them a booth. Even if they needed to assist them in saying what number they wanted to cross, they would take such time and care with them. That is a tribute to not only the polling officials but also to the patience of the Fijian voters. Many of them had been queueing, often in the sun, for a long time but there were no complaints when elderly or frail people were brought to the head of the queue to vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a debrief the following day, and as my colleagues there will attest I think there was a point when the Australian delegation said, virtually with one voice: 'Look, this needs to be judged by Pacific standards, not by a European or any other standard. Sure there may have been some glitches, sure maybe even some of the processes were over-engineered in part, but this process was a credit to its people.' The fact that our own scrutineering matched almost exactly the official tally results gave us a good sense of the veracity of the early results.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to place on record my thanks to all the MOG team, the high commission and the department, and all the locals and the NGO staff who were engaged in the process. We will be having a debrief next week, but following the preliminary statement I think it is right that we should reiterate that preliminary statement here today. In the view of the MOG:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the outcome of the 2014 Fijian election is on track to broadly represent the will of the Fijian voters and the conditions were in place for Fijians to exercise their right to vote freely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much potential for Fiji to grow and take its place as a leading nation and economy in the Pacific. There is significant foreign direct investment going into many sectors, including construction; there are opportunities for long-term industry given English is a common language; and, above all, its beautiful people are its best resource. I proudly wear the Fijian and Australian flags today. I say, 'Bula vinaka,' to the people of Fiji. Thank you very much; I look forward to us having long-term relationships as parliamentarians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  When most Australians looked at a press release from the Liberal Party on 18 March that 'the government would ensure Australian families can access affordable child care when and where they needed it', few Australians would have interpreted that as being in line with the government's conduct since then. What we have seen is a slashing of $1 billion from the childcare area of this nation, and more particularly today, a week after an action exposed the way in which the budget most particularly hurt Australians of lower incomes, we address one particular facet of thisâfamily day care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family day care is accented towards those people who work on weekends, work shifts; they are the people who particularly need this. It comes at a time when we have seen the diminishment of their wages through a tax on penalty rates and weekend rates. In New South WalesâI cannot speak about other statesâit is also particularly utilised by Indigenous families. It is specified that a significant number of family day care centre providersâ30 per cent in factâcater for children with disabilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The quotes in regard to the value of this are manifest. Julia Davison, the CEO of Good Start Early Learning commented: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has also been noted widely that an area particularly affected will be western Sydney. It is estimated that nationally 80 per cent of services throughout the country will be assaulted by these changes in a very real financial fashion. But out in western Sydney, 133 centres face some form of contraction of their income through these changes. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cite locally the situation of the Campbelltown City Council. Its Liberal-Liberal Democrat controlled majority faces some very unattractive options according to their own indicators. The options they have as a result of these federal government Liberal policies are, one, to cover the cost, unbudgeted for, through their own resources; two, to pass on the cost to user parents; or, three, to discontinue the services and sack employees and educators in that sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cite comments from Ms Mona Kelada from Eagle Valeâa person affected directly by thisâwho says, 'Should these changes take effect in their current form and time frame, the families who use my service will face potentially unaffordable fee increases or worse. If our community cannot sustain fee increases, our service may be forced to close its doors. Without family day care I will no longer be able to provide family day care, and my small business will be forced to close, leaving the families who use my service without care and me unemployed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that the maximum amount of money that Campbelltown City Council would obtain in the best-case scenario is $250,000. Last year the cost was in the area of $330,000. So we see a long-term provider that has been in the provision area since 1977, who was an option other than commercial operations, being very seriously threatened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation is contrasted with the other initiative of the government. When they can cut $1 billion from child care in general and they can slash $157 million from family day care, they can findâdespite the dire warnings about the budgetâ$5.5 billion to provide parental leave for more wealthy Australians. So what we see in Campbelltown and Liverpool is a major threat to the viability of family day care centres. </span>

Indeed, good providers all around the country have struggled. They provide really important services, but under the previous government the budget for this program blew out by $200 million. It was just another in the long list of poorly managed programs. There is no doubt it was well intentioned, but the program was poorly managed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the minister's comments in recent days on radio and in an interview, I think, a couple of days ago, with Louise Yaxleyâwho was born in my electorate some time ago and is now living in Canberraâthat there are scams and rorts that are being undertaken in some parts of the country. Nobody accepts that, and this tarnishes the reputation of the good operatorsâwhere the money should be going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very interested in this subject because Tasmania was one of the first places in Australia to provide this valuable and different kind of childcare service. In fact, family day care started in Tasmania in the mid-1970s, more than a decade before the national body claims the start of Family Day Care Australia in a cottage in the beachside suburb of Avoca in New South Wales in 1988. That is something we will have to rectify the record on, because the first day care centre service was actually established in Glenorchy, in the electorate of the member for Denisonâa Hobart suburbâin 1974. It was followed closely by the Launceston Family Day Care service in northern Tasmania in November 1975. The Glenorchy service is no longer operating, but the Launceston one very much is. It has developed to provide child care across northern Tasmaniaânot just within Launceston, I should add, but in the country towns and regional communities in my electorate in northern Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The northern Tasmania organisation was started by a woman by the name of Sheena Butler, a pioneer in her field who lived for many years at Rosevears in my electorate of Lyons. The organisation that Sheena established and ran for many years fills a void in childcare services and now provides services across northern Tasmanian country towns. It is a multipurpose service now and has even raised funds to build centres in rural areas as a base for additional services. It has just leased new premises at Longford, which will open part time in a couple of weeks and which will be fully up and running after Christmas as a base in northern Tasmania, alongside its Launceston central office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Its regional arm, called Launceston Regional Family Day Care, is still often the only childcare service in towns across my electorate of Lyonsâtowns such as Cressy, Perth, Longford, Carrick, Evandale, Westbury, Campbell Town, Scamander and Beaconsfield on the West Tamar. All 25 educators of Launceston Regional Family Day Care services are located outside the organisation's central city office and provide more than 3,500 hours of child care to 300 children across the electorate of Lyons every week. The Launceston Regional Family Day Care director, Pam Johns, contacted my office last month to seek clarification regarding the Community Support Program funding for family day care services nationally. We were very happy to inform Ms Johns that we are making sure that the money goes to support the sorts of organisations it was originally designed to support. She was a little concerned about future eligibility, and we were able to tell her that the changes to the community support program this year were not in fact a budget cut but will benefit services very much like the ones she is concerned about. In fact, because of the extraordinary growth in the family day care sector since 2006, the Community Support Program exceeded its budget under the previous government, as we are all well aware, by $200 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it was another Labor budget blow-out. Unfortunately, coming to light there were areas of the country that are inappropriately using this very worthwhile scheme. We will get it back under control. It cannot go on like this, particularly under the budget circumstances we have inherited. We will fix this. The Community Support Program has in fact been brought back within its current funding allocation. The introduction of eligibility criteria for family day care services will enable Community Support Program funding to be directed towards services in regional, remote and disadvantaged communities, which was its original intention, so that funding is targeted where it is most needed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Charlton. Before turning to questions specifically about family day care, let me say this: it is clear to Labor members of this House that Australia's future productivity depends in large part on getting child care right. For us, this means giving every child every chance for the best start in life through early childhood education of the highest quality. It also means giving their parents every choice in balancing family and work responsibilities. Those are Labor's priorities. The contrast could not be starker with this government's unfair and unaffordable paid parental leave. As part of this challenge, family day care presently offers quality, flexible early childhood education where it is needed most. The $157 million cut in funding is putting hundreds of services at risk of closure or forcing them to increase fees and pushing families away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw firsthand the valuable contribution family day care makes to our community in Scullin when I visited Boori Children's Services in Epping. Boori Children's Services Centre is part of the Whittlesea Family Day Care Scheme, providing family day care for 214 children and coordinated by the city of Whittlesea. I was struck by the passion and commitment of the educators there, as well as how much the children obviously enjoyed being there. Families right across Scullin will be impacted by these cruel and petty cuts, none of which were promised before the last electionâanother nasty surprise from this government. Families will either have to pay more in fees or see their children out of care when services close. If services choose to stay open, Family Day Care Australia estimates that fees will rise by around $35 a week as a result of this funding cut. Many families in Scullin simply cannot afford the cuts, the closures or the cost increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One reason this will have such an impact is the flexibility this service offers to parents. Some children are there every day of the week and some are there just one day a week. This suits local families and it suits the children. Every child has their own education program and a personal relationship with the educators. At Boori Children's Services Centre, one of the educators, Karen Hassed, has been there for over 20 years. She started when her child attended, and she has been there ever since. This is a sign of a commitment to the service that the government simply cannot or will not comprehend. In total, there are 26 educators employed at this centre, all of whom, as I have seen, share the same level of passion and professionalism in their work. It is important that we recognise in this place the professionalism and the education role that staff play. They are educators with professional qualifications. These centres are places of learning as much as they are places of care and support. These staff deserve to be treated with respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Whittlesea estimates that $85,000 in funding will be cut from the Whittlesea family day care scheme from July next year. This will force this service to either close or increase its fees, placing a substantial impost on families, many of whom are struggling. The Whittlesea family day care scheme is only one of nine family day care services in Scullin which will be affected by these funding cuts. The others are Nillumbik family day care scheme; Al Raja family day care; Gabow family day care; Greater Tomorrow family day care service; KW 5 Star Kids Services; Our Future family day care; and Shine Bright family day care. Family day care has been operating in Australia for over 35 years. It is part of the community fabric. In outer-suburban communities, such as the ones that I represent, it is particularly important in offering families real choice to balance the competing elements of their lives. I remind the House that, before the election, the Prime Minister promised there would be no cuts to education. But this budget cuts $1 billion of funding out of early childhood services. Australian families and early childhood educators deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Early Years Program coordinator, Penny Karagaslis; the coordination and support officer, Jo Foster; and educators Tina Nguyen, Karen Hassed, Trudi Abbott, Ramani Perera and Narelle Groves at Boori Children's Services Centre for showing me firsthand the real impact of the valuable work they do and the contribution they make every day to our community. High-quality, accessible and affordable child care is a fundamental responsibility for a national government committed to boosting employment participation and giving our children every chance for the best start in life. Supporting family day care is an important element of this. The motion is to be supported.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I am pleased to be able to speak on this PMB because it is an issue I have followed quite closely. In recent months family day care providers have contacted my office about their campaign. Families need family day care. I invited a number of those providers to attend a forum in Bundaberg, at the northern end of my electorate, where they raised their concerns directly with the Assistant Minister for Education, Susan Ley. I thank the assistant minister for making herself available and for her genuine engagement. In Hinkler, as at June 2013, 6,780 children from 4,730 families attend 83 childcare services of all types. On average, Hinkler families paid $6.15 per hour per child, compared to $6.50 in Queensland and $7.35 nationally. One Hinkler family day care provider says it has calculated that the changes we are making to the Community Support Program will increase fees by $5 per week per child. But it is important to note that CSP is not a fee assistance program and is not paid direct to the educator or parents. CSP is an operational payment paid direct to family day care services to assist them in establishing or maintaining services in areas where they might otherwise be unviable or unable to meet the requirements of the community, particularly in disadvantaged, regional and remote areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2006 the eligibility criteria were relaxed for family day care providers to help grow the then fledgling sector. Strict criteria remained in place for all other childcare service types. Family day care is now a viable sector in metropolitan areas. In our major cities there has been a 74 per cent increase in new services. By contrast, the number of services operating in regional and remote areas has declined since 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are changing the eligibility criteria from 1 July next year so that CSP criteria for family day care is better targeted towards regional, remote and disadvantaged communities where there is unmet demand or market failure. Total operation support payments through the CSP to family day care services will be capped at $250,000 per financial year to ensure the funding is distributed more equitably. The changes will also bring support for family day care services into line with other types of child care such as long day care and outside school hours care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report in 2012 by the Australian National Audit Office found that family day care was receiving 71 per cent of the total CSP budget, despite only caring for about 10 per cent of the children. The report highlighted the growing problem with CSP and recommended its eligibility guidelines be reviewed. Labor ignored the report, allowing the CSP budget to blow out by another $200 million over three years. They favoured inequity, debt and financial mismanagement over rocking the boat in the lead-up to an election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will not take our eyes off the ball. At the weekend it was revealed that the Abbott government's new childcare compliance task force had taken action against 24 childcare services since July, issuing 256 fines totalling $1.74 million. Alarmingly, family day care made up over 90 per cent of offenders. About half of the 22 non-compliant family day care coordination services were fined for making excessive claims for payments on behalf of children in their care, often unbeknown to parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents in my electorate have joined the Families Need Family Day Care campaign, but I question whether they have all the facts about the CSP program. The flyer they have signed says parents face uncertainty around increasing fees, service closures and even their capacity to remain in the workforce. As I said previously, CSP is not a fee assistance program. Parents using approved care can still apply for the child care benefit, or CCB, and child care rebate to assist with the costs of care. Parents using approved family day care receive a rate of assistance 33.3 per cent higher then parents using long day care. The maximum rate of CCB for one child in family day care is $5.32 per hour, compared to CCB of $3.99 per hour for other care. The coalition government is providing $28.5 billion over four years to assist families with childcare costs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a father of three, I understand how important family day care is to the Hinkler community. As someone who has three children, I have used all types of child care services, including family day care with people like Kim Wheat who had children of a similar age. My children have grown up in some of those environments and it was fantastic for them. Quality services that operate outside traditional hours are vital to families with working parents, particularly those who do shift work. That is why the government has designed a business development package to assist family day care providers to make the transition. The package includes access to a range of business workshops and webinars as well as professional development, support and resources.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  The Westbury RSL club in Northern Tasmania has perhaps developed an Australian first to get more young people involved in the club. Westbury RSL's Little Diggers Club has been so successful in the five years since it was launched that it has become a role model for other RSL clubs, who have made inquiries about how to set the scheme up. Westbury RSL president Denis Webb and members had wanted a way to include children from the region in activities in the club. Little Diggers started five years ago with about 10 members, girls and boys, aged about three months to 18 years and it now has 40 members.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each new young member is presented with a certificate of membership, a member's card and a registration number. They go on the birthday register and are posted a birthday card each year and are also encouraged to join the clubs once a month steak nights with a free meal ticket. The RSL club organises a Christmas party for the Diggers and an Easter gathering complete with a visit from the Easter Bunny with Easter eggs for each child.</span>

They march in a group behind the adult RSL members in the town's annual Anzac Day parade. At the last Anzac Day they marched with their own Little Diggers banner for the first time.</span>

She was also a stalwart of the teachers' federation in Queensland and a person who fought for women's rights. She was absolutely passionate about education and her whole life was dedicated to ensuring that everybody had an opportunity to access a quality education without being discriminated against simply because of how much money they had or who their mother or father was.</span>

She was somebody I will miss in the future and somebody who gave so much to the Labor movement, so much to the Labor movement, so much to women and so much to our Australian society. Rest in peace, Anne.</span>

This is a mentoring program open to 25- to 35-year-olds working in any aspect of the beef industry including production, processing, marketing and agribusiness. Participants will be paired with a mentor who has proven agricultural leadership skills. It offers young people in the industry an opportunity to follow their beef business dreams.</span>

Over 20 years, they have raised over $40,000 for local disadvantaged kids' scholarships.

They are women from our community who come together with the best interests of education at heart. VIEW, which stands for Voice, Interests and Education of Women, was established to ensure that young women, particularly in the regions, had the opportunity and the network of support to gain an education. The many fond memories that the women spoke about included meeting some of the previous students whom they had helped, who had gone on to careers and who came back to the VIEW club to speak about what they were up to. They spoke to young women from Eaglehawk and California Gully, areas of high disadvantage within the Bendigo electorate. These women have gone on to have successful careers and lives, and they owe it to the support that they received from their Bendigo VIEW Club. I congratulate Bendigo VIEW Club on its 20th anniversary and look forward to celebrating its next decade of achievements.</span>

There is no better illustration than the Turkish community within my electorate. I have heard this criticism about lack of assimilation many times. You would be hard-pressed to find a better example of assimilation than this community. One hundred years ago next year, we celebrate the original Gallipoli battle in 1915, and here is the biggest mosque in the Southern Hemisphere, named the Auburn Gallipoli Mosque. I hear a lot of criticism of what is being preached in mosques. On the Saturday following the Thursday, members of the community asked me to speak at their Eid day to 6,000 people. They asked me to specifically talk about the importance of faith, tolerance, cohesion and leadership. It was my honour to do that. They are an amazing community.</span>

I applaud our Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, because he went there under his own steam the following week and made representation to say how sorry he was to hear of the attack. I applaud the leadership of the mosque, the president, Dr Abdurrahman Asaroglu, and all the imams there for allowing me to be part of that community and speak at Eid. They are just such a wonderful community and long may they continue to serve the area of Reid.</span>

I reported on my own Eid dinners in the last sitting. They are certainly well worth participating in. I would like to put on the record the work of Rita Andraos, who is a work experience student in my office and studies at St Mary's high school. She did some speechwriting for me, so I am about to share it with the chamber. Rita wrote a report for me on the visit to the Nan Tien Buddhist temple for its 20th birthday celebrations in the electorate of my colleague the member for Throsby.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have available, I would like to report to the House the joyous event that I had the pleasure of attending on 28 September. It was truly a feast for the senses as we celebrated the 20th birthday of the Nan Tien Buddhist temple in Wollongong. It was a cheerful day for all, celebrated with picture-perfect weather at the biggest Buddhist temple in the Southern Hemisphere, known as Southern Paradise. We celebrated the completion of the $50 million Nan Tien Institute and held a ceremony for the sealing of a time capsule of the first Buddhist-run tertiary institution in Australia to receive government accreditation. The event was wrapped up by some delicious food from the vegetarian food fair, where there were many outdoor stalls. The day-long celebration was truly a community day, attracting thousands of people to the Buddhist site. I offer my congratulations to the Nan Tien Temple and look forward to attending and being part of upcoming events and well-deserved celebrations to mark the continuing 20th year anniversary.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  I am pleased to place on record some fantastic news for people on the Central Coast today. The NBN is on track to be delivered to more than 56,000 homes and businesses in my electorate. Over the next 12 months, in addition to construction that has already commenced, another 25 suburbs will be included in the national rollout, which means super-fast broadband is now a giant step closer to reality for even more people on the Central Coast. That is great news for people living and working in Umina Beach, Woy Woy, Pearl Beach, Patonga, Green Point, Killcare, Killcare Heights, Ettalong Beach, Booker Bay, Daleys Point, St Huberts Island, Blackwall, Phegans Bay, Woy Woy Bay, Horsefield Bay, Yattalunga, Pretty Beach, Wagstaffe, Boxhead, Empire Bay, Bensville, Saratoga, Davistown, Koolewong and Kincumber.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over coming weeks, people can expect to see workers out in their street planning the new network to get this fibre-to-the-node network built. It is great news for residents such as John Simmons from the Bensville Residents Association and Roger Murray from the Pearl Beach Progress Association, both of whom have been terrific advocates for their community, and I thank them for that. They have both outlined the many challenges of not having access to fast broadband. The Central Coast waited for six long years, and all they got under the former Labor government was upgrades to 203 premises in my electorate. Businesses and residents have been calling for this, and today we can affirm that this government will deliver.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most important festivals in the Hindu calendar. Held either on 22 or 23 Octoberâdepending on whether you are on north Indian time or south Indian timeâDiwali was celebrated this weekend in Canberra with a significant festival at the Albert Hall. The program was split into three parts: the saffron session, the white session and the green session. It was my pleasure to be one of the chief guests in the green session. I pay tribute to Krishan Aggarwal, the chairman of Diwali Mela Inc, and to the many people who work to make the Diwali celebration a success. The participants included guests from the Oriya Association, the Karnataka Association, the India-Australia of Canberra, the Canberra Bhangra Jammers, the Filipino Association of Canberra, a Tamil Nadu dancing group, an Assamese folk dancing group, and the Canberra Sikh Association. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The music was extraordinary, as was the display of Bollywood dancing. Diwali celebrates the victory of light over darkness, and it is an important reminder that all of us are strengthened when we celebrate each other's festivals.</span>

There was something for every age group: wood chopping displays, farm machinery, dog agility courses, a quick shearing display, rides for the kids, a grand paradeâwith a vintage Citroen that would not look out of place in your drivewayâsheep and cattle judging; just to name a few of the attractions on offer.</span>

And, once again, they did not disappoint: scallop pies, wallaby pies, beautiful lamb wraps, and the best chips north of Launceston. The wonderful Pura Graham was named Flinders Island Citizen of the Year.  Pura is an icon on Flinders Island, with an extraordinary generosity of spirit. Hector Grimshaw was the Lions Club Young Citizen of the Year, a community-minded young man with a bright future. </span>

I encourage everyone to put a diary place marker in their 2015 diary for the 81st Flinders Island Show and enjoy this jewel in the crown of the Furneaux Islands group.</span>

Peter Kitson was, in his own words, a self-confessed political tragic for the ALP. Peter became politicised at Sydney university in 1967 where he had to register for national service, which prompted him to join the Labor Party. Peter was a good friend of former Labor MP John Murphy, and Peter played a very important role in supporting John in his early years in the ALP and, indeed, through his political career.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter moved to South Australia seven years ago and was a regular attendee at the local Kingston FEC, where he regularly participated and was an active member. Peter often told me he would watch question time almost every day and was never short on commentary to contribute to the political proceedings of the dayâon which, I have to say, I agreed with him regularly.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke about Peter earlier this year in my address-in-reply speech, thanking him for his tireless work in the 2013 Kingston election campaign. He did have ongoing health issues but it did not stop him from being out there on the polling booth on election day. I offer his siblings, Bill, Robert and Mary, and his daughters, Chloe and Sophie, my sincere condolences, and I pay tribute to Peter's contributions to the Labor movement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I want to record my sincere appreciation and admiration for retiring Barossa Mayor Mr Brian Hurn OAM. I have known Brian both as a local government colleague and more recently in my capacity as the federal member for Barker. Brian is, of course, a local institution in the Barossa and he will be remembered as a giant across several fields, including sport, agriculture, public service and community leadership. Following a celebrated sporting career that included, amongst other things, winning the Sheffield Shield for South Australia in the 1963-64 sideâwhich I should say included no less than seven Australian players, two of whom went on to captain the nation; he also played in that side with Garry Sobers and one former member for Barker, Ian McLachlanâhe joined local government in 1977 in the District Council of Angaston. He served as chairman of that council for 10 years and subsequently as Mayor of the Barossa since 1996. Brian has served as president of the Southern and Hills LGA and on the Local Super Board and was chairman of the Local Government Transport Advisory Panel. He has been honoured as the 2010 recipient of the John Legoe Award. In 1994, Brian Hurn was awarded the national medal for his services to community in hazardous circumstances. In 1999, he was bestowed the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to local government through the Barossa council and the community BankSA. In 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal for his service to local government. While Brian Hurn has decided to retire from his position as mayor, his example will long be a benchmark for those of us in public life to aspire to.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  Along with other political leaders in Ipswich, I attended the Raceview Congregational Church last Sunday for a special church service. It is a church located in Wildey Street in Raceview, Ipswich. It has served the Ipswich community for 150 years. The morning tea afterwards was held in the 133-year-old community hall. The special church service was to welcome the new pastor, Pastor Billy Diehm, who formerly was the community partnership manager at 96five Family Radio Brisbane. He gave an interesting sermon that talked about serving the community. Indeed, 'serving the community' is the motto of the church.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My wife and I were pleased to be there because this particular church has a number of institutions and organisations with which we are familiar located there. For example, our eldest daughter Alex attended the kindergarten many years ago. It is located opposite the biggest primary school in Ipswich, Raceview State School. The church of only 30 adult members these days once had the biggest Sunday school in Australia, with 250 kids going to it. But indeed, in this day and age, this little church actually has a football club called Raceview Congregational United Soccer Club, of 18 men's, women's, boys' and girls' teams. They run probably the fittest group of 60s fitness club I have ever seen. Nearly everyone in the church is fighting fit and looks like they could run half-marathons. They have wonderful playgroups and a ladies fellowship group. Also, I was pleased to be there because in the afternoon Pastor Levi runs a Samoan community church.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I rise to congratulate the Bundaberg Fruit &amp; Vegetable Growers association on running another successful night in recent weeks. Peter Hockings and his team have done a fabulous job once again and over 500 local growers and their associates turned out for the event in the Civic Centre in Bundaberg. The people that are in that room know better than anyone else does what it takes to be successful. It is an Australian farming trait to have a go, work hard and, hopefully, be rewarded. As someone who has worked in the industry for many years, who was a farmer for over a decade and whose family have been involved locally for 40 or 50 years, I can tell you that farmers learn one thing of great importance. That is resilience. They also know that the money is not there until it is in the bank. It does not matter what stage the crop is at or what the exchange rate might look like or what the weather is doing; until you are paid, it is never over. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the pleasure of representing Prime Minister Tony Abbott at the event and read a message from him which outlined all the things we are doing to help the sector. I was also pleased to see some of my federal colleagues there as well, including Palmer United Senator Glenn Lazarus. However, I was very disappointed that, after meeting with a handful of growers earlier in the day, he told journalists that farmers were being treated 'like second class citizens' by the government and 'lack the minimum levels of support they need to survive, let alone succeed'. I would like to read what BFVG chairman, Geoff Chivers, posted online:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Disappointed to see that Senator Lazarus has turned a positive discussion into a political statement, inferring that we were being treated like second-class citizens. This is not the case. In fact, the current Government has been working closely with our industry to deal with the issues we face.</span>

It is worth reflecting that the UN has never been more important than it is right now as the world grapples with the shared challenges of rising inequality, climate change, conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, and Ebola, among other things. As the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">At this critical moment, let us reaffirm our commitment to empowering the marginalized and vulnerable. On United Nations Day, I call on Governments and individuals to work in common cause for the common good.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also take this opportunity to remember those who have lost their lives or have been injured in the course of carrying out their duties as international civil servants. We pay tribute to UN staff around the world for their efforts and courage in their work to protect civilians and resolve conflict, to alleviate poverty and suffering, to strengthen human rights and good governance, and to protect cultural heritage and the environment. As the MDGs transform into the sustainable development goals, much has been achieved, but there is still much more to do. The UN is integral to that effort and it is incumbent on all of us as public policymakers to ensure that the United Nations is appropriately mandated, resourced and supported to do its work effectively.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I recently had the pleasure of attending the Trinity College blessing and official opening of the La Chaperie Visual Arts Facility, the Ludovic Building and the Brother John Mullins Administration Building. The projects, totalling $2.3 million, were funded through the Australian government and the state government, and there was also a contribution from the school community. During the ceremony it was fascinating to hear about Brother John Mullins, the founding principal of the college who opened the doors back in 1982. Back then, Brother John Mullins lived on site at the brother's house, which is still there today. He had a profound effect on the school community and his legacy lives on today through the family that is Trinity College. He was charged to build a school, but with it he built a community with a deep sense of family spirit that still exists to this day. Brother John Mullins worked tirelessly for the families of Trinity College under the values of humility, simplicity and modesty. It was an absolute pleasure to be able to open the new administration building in his name and to unveil a plaque. I would like to thank the principal of Trinity College, Mrs Catherine Thompson, for inviting me to be part of such a special occasion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Two weeks ago, I went with my son to see South Sydney win their 21st premiershipâa 30-to-six victory over Canterbury Bankstown. It was a special celebration, particularly for all the people who campaigned for South Sydney's right to playâthe 80,000 people who marched in the streets of Sydney to declare that football was not just about sport; it was about community identity and a sense of belonging. It was a great night. I got to go with my friend, the chairman, Nick Pappas, and former board members. I was on the board during the period in which we were excluded from the competition. There was Andrew Denton, Ray Martin, Nick Hatzistergos and other members of the South Sydney family. I also had a chat with the Burrowâsalt of the earth people for whom that victory, particularly for the Indigenous community based in the South Sydney area, was so important. To watch John Sutton's leadership, Sam Burgess's courage and Greg Inglis's skill, capped off with him doing the goanna after the last try, was a great evening indeed. It was great that it was versus Canterbury, also a club based in their local community. The leadership of Michael Maguire, Souths' coach, and Shane Richardson, the CEO, has made this possible. I am sure that the 22nd premiership is not far away.</span>

Here, the Martu Rangers, part of the Central Desert Native Title Services, under the stewardship of Rob Thomas, provide conservation services, including weed spraying, flora and fauna surveys, environmental monitoring, assessment and measurement on the rehabilitated sites of Northern Star Resources' goldmine.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With 191 days of labour service provided in 2013, Northern Star is expanding the ranger program in 2014. These Indigenous Martu Rangers are engaged on a fee-for-service basis, working alongside environmental officers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On our visit, there were three rangers at work, from a pool of seven, all of whom live in the town of Wiluna. Depending on other commitmentsâsuch as cultural, law or family businessâeach ranger generally chooses to work at the mine for one or two weekly rotations per month. It is good work and it is flexible. There is good food and lodgings and respect, and they are learning, and earning a salary.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  Yesterday I had the great pleasure of officially opening Canberra's Diwali Mela at Albert Hall. This annual festival has been running in Canberra since 2003 to celebrate the famous Festival of Lights. There are a number of community organisations of Indian cultural background that support the event, and it is a fantastic opportunity to come together and celebrate Indian culture, food and dancing. I was fortunate enough to open the festival yesterday, as I mentioned, which is part of a five-day Hindu festival in India, marking an event from 5,000 years ago. As I said, it was a truly great day, with hundreds of people enjoying Bollywood dancing, the infamous fireworks that are always associated with Deepavaliâand I have memories of living in India where my front yard was blown up by the fireworksâdancing and food. It was fantastic to see people from a range of South Asian backgrounds come together and share the richness of the Indian culture, from the north, the south, the east and the westâright across this great nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Festival of Lights celebrates the victory of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. It represents a reaffirmation of hope, a renewed commitment to friendship and religious tolerance, and spreading the word of peace and harmony. But, most of all, it is a celebration of the simple joys of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Philip moved to Penrith with his wife in 1952 and, as a result, the Fehon family have become an integral part of our Penrith community. Prior to opening his own practice in 1964, he worked for a range of local businesses, including Neils, and Ron Mulock's practice. Phil served on the executive of the Nepean Hospital and was President of the Penrith chamber of commerce. In 1979, he was awarded a Paul Harris Fellow by South Penrith Rotary. Later, his work in the community and the church was recognised with a Medal of the Order of Australia and a Papal Knighthood.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking about his father, Bernard remarked: 'Dad was always busy helping others, but he always had time as a father to include us in projects, like building a shed. Those were great projects, and those were family times.' Bernard Fehon, of course, has gone on to be the man who started the CEO Sleepout. Phil is survived by a massive seven children, 21 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often say that Penrith is like a big country town. We are a regional city, but we have a very strong community and a network, and, when someone like Phil passes away, he is definitely felt. I thank Phil for his contribution to the community. I would like to thank the Fehon family for continually supporting our community. Vale, Philip Fehon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I take this opportunity to congratulate and commend the Tea Tree Plaza Walking Group, who this year celebrated their 10th anniversary. The group has several hundred members, with an average turn-out of over 100 participating in each walk. In addition to walking, the group is engaged in numerous community and social events including outings, lunches, bus tours and so on. But, most importantly, the group provides for a safe, indoor venue which enables members, mainly older people or people with a disability, to safely exercise by walking in a safe environment out of the weather whilst simultaneously socialising with one another. It is a great way for people who are quite often on their own to meet friends and make new acquaintances.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate everyone who over the past 10 years has been involved with the group in one way or another and ensured that it continues to grow as it has done. I also congratulate all the officeholders for the work that they have done in ensuring the group's success over the years. I take this opportunity to not only wish the group well for the years ahead but to also encourage anyone who wants to join a group that enables them to safely exercise to join the Tea Tree Plaza Walking Group if they live in the Tea Tree Gully area. Once again, I commend everyone involved for the initiative.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout the past three days I have been able to participate in work experience with the federal member for Gilmore, the electorate I grew up in and have lived in my whole life. I have spent the days of my work experience being escorted around the halls of Parliament House. I was able to see the behind-the-scenes work of my local member and her very dedicated staff. I then went straight to work on looking at the local newspapers and pointing out anything of interest to the electorate. This was interesting and enjoyable because I was able to look deeper into what was going on in my electorate. I was extremely enthusiastic about the rest of the first day and jumped straight into what I was given nextâlisting the names of year 12 students who recently received awards at their graduation ceremony. The most enjoyable thing I worked on was organising a forum for the youth of the southern parts of the Gilmore electorate. I have been able to expand on my organisational skills and will continue to develop my skills throughout the planning and running of this forum. I have really enjoyed work experience with a member of parliament and would one day like to see my name on one of the walls.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  The focus on mental health across the country during Mental Health Week from 5 to 11 October was fantastic. The ABC's promotion 'Mental As' deserves a special mention. It was great listening and viewing, and played a big role in the raising of awareness. In my electorate of Indi we celebrated World Mental Health Day on Friday, October 10 with a luncheon at Shimla restaurant in Bright. It was a chance for people to get together and talk about mental health issues being faced in the community and how we can better coordinate services. It was also a chance to show those suffering from mental health problems that they are not alone and that their community will support them. I will continue to work with people to support improved coordination of services and funding both in Indi and across the rural community. I give special thanks to the organisers, Cesare and Prue, and their staff for the terrific Indian food and to everybody who attended, including the Bright sponsors. Speakers Pauline Saunier and Cath Smith gave very moving talks, both having been impacted by mental health issues in different ways.</span>

It is very important that we raise awareness and understanding of how mental health issues are impacting on our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  There are fewer and fewer communities these days that do not have some sort of access to long day care child care services. Unfortunately Boorowa, in my electorate, has been one of them. There is a great little pre-school there, Boorowa pre-school, which is doing a wonderful job, but there is no long day care. It is well known that families with access to long day care have more choice. That is why the federal government is so keen to support the child care sector and support regional families like those in my electorate of Hume. We have announced $50,000 in capital works funding to start the process of converting Boorowa pre-school into a long day care centre. Under the Long Day Care Capital Funding Exceptional Circumstances Grant Program, the preschool will be able to move forward with planning and design and engage the services of a suitably qualified architect. I have visited the Boorowa Preschool Centre recently and have heard first hand, just earlier today in fact, from committee president, Sarah Rose, on the first steps. The committee is ready to appoint an architect, and the overall rebuild, to almost triple the size of the existing facilities, is estimated at approximately $600,000 and will involve converting the current preschool building into a facility for babies and adding additional rooms for two- to three-year-olds and older children.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that is really special about this program is that it is being delivered in partnership with the Belmont Neighbourhood Centre, which is a hub for community activity within the Belmont area. Sunnyfield will outreach into the community from the neighbourhood centre. The neighbourhood centre also provides the ability for the clients of Sunnyfield to undertake daily living skillsâlearning to cook and to use computers. There is a community garden there where the clients can go out and be mentored by volunteers. In addition, there is an outstanding Men's Shed. The men who work in that Men's Shed will take the clients of Sunnyfield under their wing. This is the way that things should workâpartnerships between different organisations in the community. It will be a vital resource for people with disabilities in the Lake Macquarie area and as the NDIS continues to be rolled out within the area.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  Last week I attended the launch of Mental Health Week at Wesley Mission's Clinical Education Facility in Kogarah, a facility which I opened in May.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commend the work that Wesley Mission is doing in drawing attention to the elephant in the room for the beginning of Mental Health Week. This was part of a campaign spearheaded by the Australian Private Hospitals Association to combat the stigma surrounding mental illness and celebrating the work that private hospitals do in assisting more than 32,000 Australians with these issues every year. 'The elephant in the room' was an analogy for the often-ignored illness that affects so many of our family members, workmates and friends. Whilst we now have a great clinical understanding of mental illness, we must pair this with a deep social understanding amongst the community and reinforce that it is both acceptable and vital to seek and offer support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have grown up alongside strong individuals who hit the tragic roadblock of mental illness. My work in directing an aged care facility also provided me with an insight into the ramifications of mental and neurological conditions. Rather than marginalising Australians who suffer from mental health issues, we should bring this issue front and centre in the understanding that one in five Australians will suffer poor mental health every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud Wesley Mission for the work they are doing in hosting that conversation, and Australian Private Hospitals Association for their message that we do not need to have all the answers, we just need to start the conversation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  Just a moment ago, I took the chamber to the southern border of my electorate and the 20th anniversary of the Nan Tien Buddhist temple. I would now like to take you to the northern border of my electorate and the Helensburgh based Hindu temple, which I will be attending this Saturday for the Deepavali festivalâthe festival of lights, as some of my colleagues have reflected on enjoying in Canberra last weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August, I was there for the Ganesh Visarjan festival, which was a very joyous occasion. It was a beautiful afternoon, with blue sky, crisp air and a gloriously shining sun. I attended the temple for the Ganesh Visarjan festival. In true community spirit there was much cultural, spiritual and religious activity, all coming together for the festival. It marked the last day of Ganeshotsav, which is a spectacular festival honouring Lord Ganesha for 10 days in the sixth month of the Hindu lunar calendar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The festival was unforgettable; it was shaped by very loud drum playing, clouds of coloured flour, dancing people and happy children. It was a truly successful day which included many activities that show the diversity of our cultural communities and the inclusion of all in the celebration at these significant events. I would like to thank the Sri Venkateswara temple in Helensburgh for hosting it, and for their hospitality to me.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the footrace that stops a city. It is something that the people of the north-west coastâparticularly the people of the city of Burnieâare extremely proud of. I had the pleasure of serving as one of the directors of the board of the Burnie Ten for a number of years until other matters took over. I can say that the commitment of the committee, the Burnie City Council, the hundreds of volunteers and the local regional newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span> have made this the success that it is. I want to pay tribute to Mike Boss-Walker, to instigated this event way back in 1984 and who has great pride in the fact that we celebrated the 30th race just yesterday.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is appropriate for me to recognise those committed board members and volunteers that have gone before usâStephen Hite, Jeremy White, Martin Jordan, Nick Walker and John Woods. They have passed on, but they have made a great race that brings great economic and health benefits to the region and to the City of Burnie, and I pay tribute to them all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:46</span>):  My grievance today is about the government's controversial 2014 federal budget measures and the effect they are going to have on the people in my electorate of Calwell, who will inevitably bear the full brunt of the government's budget cuts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer, in describing his budget, has labelled it as one that brings an end to the age of entitlement. This is a reference which is no doubt designed to impugn the dignity and credibility of those Australians who, for a series of reasonsâoften not of their own choosingâcome into circumstances where they need or depend on government assistance in order to negotiate the daily costs of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are Australians whose hopes and aspirations, and capacity to fulfil them, depend largely on governments making the right choices and investments in the future prosperity of their people. My electorate is a very diverse electorate, on both cultural and socio-economic levels. Many suburbs, including Broadmeadows, more often than not, show up amongst the most disadvantaged postcodes nationally. It is a stereotype that has been worn for decades, but Calwell is home to salt-of-the-earth communities with migrant stories in abundance and pride and resilience aplenty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my electorate have consistently borne the brunt of massive job losses in the manufacturing sector, the most recent blow, of course, has been the closure of Ford Broadmeadows in 2016. The lifeline of many unskilled and low skilled communities has been manufacturing, and its demise, especially the car industry, has hit my electorate hard. This is not through any fault of their own.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my electorate are, despite the Treasurer's imputation, keen to work and provide for themselves and their families. Contrary to the Treasurer's labelling of them as 'leaners' they are people who have aspirations and the desire to make a go of itâactually to be lifters. But to do so they need a government that can assist by creating opportunities and investing in creating jobs and making this very much a priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2014 federal budget hurts people the most who can least afford it. This budget intends to hurt my constituents, and that says everything about the Abbott government's priorities. In this unfair budget of broken promises my constituents are looking at an increase in petrol tax, a new GP tax as well as increases in the cost of medicine and cuts to family tax benefits, changes to the superannuation contribution, a rise in the retirement age and changes to the age pension. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, their children are looking at the prospect of university education being unaffordable as a result of the proposed deregulation of university fees, and there is very little in the way of investment in creating jobs in this budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you ever were looking to understand the disconnect between the government and ordinary Australians, you need look no further than the Treasurer's own now infamous, petulant and dismissive remarks that a proposed fuel excise tax will 'not affect poor people because they do not drive cars'. Many people in my electorate are not well off. In fact, many of them are living on and below the poverty line, but they actually do drive cars. Living in Melbourne's north-west does not provide them with too many suitable alternatives to move around, to get to work and to go about their business, so they have to use cars. As such, these so-called 'poor people' will be adversely affected despite the Treasurer's one-liner routine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not surprised, therefore, at the findings of the recently released report by the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling detailing the effect of the federal budget on communities, which shows that my electorate of Calwell is the most adversely affected electorate in Victoria and, indeed, in the top 16 adversely affected electorates nationwide. This study shows that the most disadvantaged communities are in fact propping up, through savage budget cuts, Australia's wealthiest suburbs and communities. In a political context, the report shows that, ultimately, the electorates hit hardest are the ones that the coalition has no chance of winning. Of the 16 most affected seats, 15 are indeed safe Labor seats. This cannot be a coincidence or an unintended consequence, because, in the Abbott government's Australia, we can forget about the Aussie fair go. Team Australia is in fact more about dog-whistling than the good old Aussie fair go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's budget, as evidenced in this report, is tailored to give to the rich and take away from the many less well off people in my electorate. The University of Canberra's report affirms that families in my electorate will be hit by some $783 in cuts in 2017, and for families with children this will rise to more than $2,000. Of course, this is in stark contrast to the federal electorate of Wentworth, where the typical hit for a family is an average budget cut of less than $70 or, for families with children, $620. Coincidence? Maybe, but, in comparing this statistic further, we see that the Treasurer's electorate of North Sydney is the third least adversely affected by the budget measures, which might explain the Treasurer's myopia, while the Labor electorate of Blaxland is the worst hit in New South Wales, with families being forced to cough up a further $2,100. I guess the people in my electorate have a right to ask, without being accused of playing the politics of envy, why they are the ones who are forced to shoulder the burden of budget cuts when, as evidenced in the report, other wealthier and more endowed electorates are less affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such is the alarm about the proposed budget cuts in my electorate that local residents and community groups have come together to stand up, to resist and to fight for the general wellbeing of our local communities. As such, they have formed the Hume Action Think Tank and have called on my office to hold community forums to raise awareness and educate and activate residents to voice their concerns about the budget. For the record, my residents want affordable education, continuing access to universal health care, an adequate age pension and a fairer taxation system where those who can pay should pay. They are particularly angered by revelations recently that multinational corporate businesses such as Google, Apple and Microsoft manage to find ways to avoid paying their share of tax. Above all, they want employment opportunities for all, especially the young people in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, with the Hume Action Think Tank leading the charge, I will, as their representative in this place, ensure that we as an opposition continue to do whatever is possible to oppose and defeat the draconian and unfair budget measures being pursued by a government that has broken faith and trust with the Australian electorate. Today, I have held two budget forums in my office, and there are more planned in the near future. It is my community's intention to keep the pressure on the government. I commend the good people of Calwell on their action and their proactivity and advocacy. They are, after all, a community who have always had to fight for their rights every inch of the way, and they will continue to do so now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further concern about the effects of the budget on my electorate comes from the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia, who, in their submission to the Senate select committee, warn that the challenges for people from multicultural communities living below the poverty line continue to linger as a result of the continued uncertainty around the 2014 federal budget measures. This is a gain of particular relevance to my electorate, because it has one of the highest concentrations of multicultural communities in the country, with an emerging new community that has come here under the refugee and humanitarian program. FECCA raises concerns about the introduction of the $7 co-payment for GP visits and other health measures and believes that it will deter culturally and linguistically diverse Australians from seeking preventive medical treatment and cautions that this change will only add to the already-large range of barriers that prevent effective access to health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know firsthand the difficulty associated with getting migrant women into, for example, breast screening programs as well as encouraging people to participate in the bowel screening program, because I have worked hard to raise awareness and to encourage participation. But now it will be harder to encourage participation in what are lifesaving preventive health measures. The abolition of the Medicare Locals that have actually provided vital grassroots services to culturally and linguistically diverse communities, already seriously stretched and unable to meet the geographic needs, will now see increased pressure of the provision and availability of services. FECCA is also very concerned about the proposed changes to unemployment benefits for young Australians, citing that these changes will compound the stress and burden already faced by young job seekers from multicultural backgrounds who already face additional disadvantage in securing sustainable employment. If we cannot invest properly in helping young people, and especially newer migrants, to get jobs then we are letting the entire country down, not just my constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish where I began in this grievance debate today. The opposition has valid reasons for opposing this budget. If there was every any doubt, all you would have to do is look to electorates such as mine to see that a serious case of inequity is at play here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249764" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  It would be an understatement to say that there is a lot happening in the world today. Australia as a nation has a lot on its plate. But our country is facing another potential national crisis, a crisis that threatens our entire industry in the state of Queensland, threatens to cause a devastating impact on livelihoods and threatens to put Australia in a position that it can never repair or reverse. I am talking about the danger of exploding pineapples. You heard me correctly: the issue of exploding pineapples is one that threatens to engulf Queensland's $80 million fresh pineapple industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can you imagine the catastrophe? One minute you are walking past a peaceful pineapple patch in the hinterland, and the nextâbang!âa pineapple spontaneously explodes like a hand grenade. According to the respected industry leaders we are in grave danger or becoming a nation of exploding pineapples. This might sound slightly exaggerated and not the hallmark of a serious national issue. But let me explain. Exploding pineapples could be the result if this nation does not listen to current warnings from our nation's key pineapple supply industry. The industry is concerned about a move to allow the importation into Australia of fresh pineapples from Malaysia. Let me make it clear. My comments today are not a racial slur designed to offend our friends in Malaysia or their pineapples. But they are designed to highlight the fact that the Australian pineapples industry is highly vulnerable and that importing fresh, decrowned pineapples from our Asian neighbours could introduce a disease that could potentially decimate our own industry, the result of which would be to ruin our local growers and lead to paddocks of pineapples spontaneously exploding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It may sound as though I am making light of this matter, but let me assure you: this is a real disease, this is a real threat, this is a real national issue. The disease I am talking about is the pineapples strain of <span style="font-style:italic;">Erwinia chrysanthemi</span>. The disease is an internal rot that has been known to make the pineapple explode. Part of the cause is an internal build-up of noxious gas that swells up inside the fruit. There is no known method of dealing with the disease and no known way to eradicate it. A decrowned pineapple is one that has had its green head removed. In Australia, all of our major industry is based in Queensland, supplying about 60,000 tonnes of fruit a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My home town of Yeppoon, on the Central Queensland Capricorn cost, is the headquarters for a company called Tropical Pines. Sourcing fruit from all over the state, Tropical Pines supplies 45 per cent of our nation's appetite for fresh pineapple. I have a huge interest in this industry. Earlier this year I brought 300 fresh Yeppoon pineapples to parliament house in Canberra to distribute to my federal colleagues. My 'pines for parliament' campaign aimed to highlight the agricultural diversity of my electorate of Capricornia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a week ago, I was asked to help judge Yeppoon's Pineapple Festival street parade, which celebrates this tropical Queensland fruit. Now, I ask this question: why would we as Australians want to put at risk an industry that we consider worth celebrating with a community festival?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry leaders are distressed by the thought that Australian bureaucrats see nothing wrong with putting our industry at such risk. This disease is most prevalent in the most popular varieties grown in Malaysia, and has been known to wipe out up to 40 per cent of a crop, when detected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you a detailed background. The federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, or DAFF, has performed an import risk-analysis for the importation of fresh pineapple from Malaysia. Respected members of the Queensland pineapple industry have thoroughly reviewed the document and they believe an error has been made by the department's bureaucrats when assessing the probability and impact of the exploding pineapple disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tropical Pines CEO, Derek Lightfoot, indicates that there is no known method of dealing with the disease and no known way to eradicate it. The only way it is managed is to throw away the pineapples that are showing signs of the disease. Mr Lightfoot asserts that two per cent of contaminated pineapples will not show any signs or warning of the disease, even though they are infected internally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to read to you part of a report provided to me by the Queensland pineapple industry:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If the disease is not showing visually, then it will not be discarded by packers and will mistakenly enter the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no known way of treating the diseased pineapples through quarantine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When assessing the probability of this disease being imported into Australia, DAFF has assessed the probability as low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Queensland pineapple industry executives say DAFF is in error, and confuses the frequency or number of diseased pineapples entering Australia, with the real probability of diseased pineapples entering Australia. This is an important distinction. Experienced industry managers like Derek Lightfoot and Mick Cranny maintain that the probability of importation is certain, because up to two per cent of the fruit arriving here will carry the disease in a manner that is not detectable. To quote directly from their assessments:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When an event is certain, the probability is 100 per cent, and therefore the probability for this pineapple disease should have been assessed by DAFF as high and not low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It appears that DAFF may have looked at two per cent as being low, but in fact their two per cent refers to how many pineapples will carry the disease, rather than the probability of the disease entering Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Normally, a correct assessment would ensure that additional safeguards should be put in place to prevent this disease coming to Australia, or imports should not be allowed. However, both of the Tropical Pines experts say that the 'key point here is that there are no additional safeguards that can be put in place because there is no known method of treating' this exploding pineapple disease, especially when you cannot see the effects on the outside of the fruit. 'Therefore the import of fresh pineapple from Malaysia, should not be allowed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a country in which we cannot even take fruit across our own state borders without risking a fine, because of the apparent risk of spreading disease. In airports like Perth, sniffer dogs roam around baggage collection points to detect passengers who may have carried a banana or a pineapple off a direct flight from Brisbane. Yet our government departments are prepared to allow a fruit with a significant disease risk to freely enter our national borders from Malaysia. We quarantine international race horses prior to the Melbourne Cup, all in the name of disease prevention. We outlaw animals with foot and mouth disease or rabies. Yet, we are a nation that appears willing to allow a dreadful disease to potentially infiltrate our iconic pineapple industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must not allow this nation to suffer from exploding pineapples. Queensland's leading pineapple industry officials go on to assert that DAFF's error is a technical error, but a very dangerous one. As a result, Tropical Pines has provided me with the following questions to ask this House. Why would we allow a disease into Australia that cannot be treated but can wipe out our pineapple industry? Why would we risk the pineapple industry for an annual quota of 200 tonnes of pineapples from Malaysia when we already produce 60,000 tonnes of pineapples in Australia? The risk-benefit equation makes no sense. Who is liable when this disease takes hold and cannot be eradicated and destroys the Australian pineapple industryâespecially when DAFF has made a mistake in the risk analysis?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pineapple industry in Queensland is worth $80 million a year. We have about 80 growers, and the sale of fresh pineapples is growing at a rate of five per cent per annum. Earlier this year, our colleagues in the Australian Senate completed an inquiry into the importation of decrowned Malaysian pineapples and recommended that they should not be allowed to enter our country. Yet bureaucrats from DAFF are bent on pushing ahead with the importation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, agricultural experts report that in Hawaii the same disease affected other plants that were grown in soil that had been infected by the exploding pineapple disease. Today, I call on common sense to prevail. Bureaucrats have the power to halt this madness. Do we want to be among the world's leading nations of exploding pineapples, or do we want to ensure that we maintain a healthy and growing Australian industry, of which we can rightly be proud?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  In the first week of May, I had the opportunity to attend the OECD Forum during OECD Week in Paris. One recurring theme during the discussions was a lament about declining trust by the public in governments and politicians, apparently occurring right around the world. The OECD noted this as a very important issue. People were concerned that lack of faith in the political process led to public disengagement, and were also concerned about ongoing and quite widespread problems of corruption.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, parliament rejected a parliamentary committee's recommendation that Australia establish a federal body to reduce the risk of corruption and misconduct by overseeing all Commonwealth public sector bodies. The committee's final report quoted the then Queensland Premier Anna Bligh's reflections on that state's approach to integrity when it established what is now its Crime and Misconduct Commission in the aftermath of the Fitzgerald inquiry into corruption in the Bjelke-Petersen era. Anna Bligh said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Despite the inevitable embarrassment from time to time, I would much â¦ a system which is not afraid to pick up the rock and discover the ugliness underneath than one that is content to â¦ assume that an undisturbed rock is a sign of good health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ there could be a lot of 'undisturbed rocks' that need to be overturned if the public is to be fully assured that integrity in the public sector is being properly maintained and safeguarded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's formal response to the committee's recommendation at the time took a different approach. The government said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On the available evidence, there is no convincing case for the establishment of a single overarching integrity commission. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The answer assumes the existing system for detecting corruption works well. But in the light of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against CorruptionâICACârevelations, I think we have to revisit this issue. In my view an anticorruption commission at the federal level is essential to ensure the integrity of our political system when, all too often, money talks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Water Holdings scandal is a case study in the politics of greed, and a cautionary tale. Supposedly, AWH provided reticulated services in Sydney's north-west development corridor, but in reality it operated as a funnel for vast amounts of money for political lobbying and donations, with both Labor and Liberal Party personnel engaged in disgraceful conduct. Little wonder the public is chastened about its political representatives when revelations such as this occur. As the assisting counsel to ICAC, Geoffrey Watson, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In an uncharacteristic display of bipartisanship, the events cross political lines. It might be said, readapting Shakespeare, that corruption acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">James Madison, a founding father of the United States Constitution, was acutely aware of the self-interested activities of legislators and their allies in commerce and industry. Madison used the analogy of 'harvesting' to describe the behaviour of well-informed and politically well-connected individuals who are able to extract 'rents' from the opportunities opened up by government regulations and legislation. These 'sagacious and monied few' are able then to pocket their political harvest at the expense of the 'industrious and uninformed mass of the people'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that Madison's observation is not how we do business in Australia and that the public's expectations of how democracy should function are not undermined by a cynicism born of the revelations they see emanating from the ICAC. Otherwise, public disengagement will be exacerbated and may become entrenched, which serves only those vested interests who already wield too much influence in the corridors of power. This influence has also been demonstrated when it comes to political donations, which has become all too apparent with revelations flowing from the ICAC in New South Wales, which has been devastating for public confidence and trust in government, whether Labor or Liberal, and has been devastating in terms of confidence in the political process more generally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ICAC has revealed the extensive use of slush funds and associated entities to obscure the origin of millions of dollars worth of donations flowing into big political parties, some of which breach state bans on taking money from property developers and other donors. A ban on developers donating in New South Wales was introduced in 2009, yet counsel assisting the ICAC, Geoffrey Watson SC, said in April this year that one of the nation's largest developers, Meriton's Harry Triguboff, had hidden his donations to the New South Wales Liberal Party via the Free Enterprise Foundation. Mr Watson said that this was done to avoid the state ban. Mr Watson told the ICAC that the facts showed that the foundation was a tool of the Liberal Party and the donations were immediately re-donated to the party in what he described as 'a systematic subversion of the electoral laws'. He said that between July 2010 and June 2012âa period that included the last state election, in March 201âthe New South Wales Liberal Party received $693,000 from the Free Enterprise Foundation. The chief fundraiser for the Liberal Party and chairman of the Millennium Forum, Paul Nicolaou, admitted that the arrangement was used to channel money from prohibited donors and that this had been discussed with other party officials. Asked to give an example of a prohibited donation, he replied, 'Harry Triguboff, Meriton's.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of ICAC is extremely important and lights a path for where we need to go at a federal level and in my own home state of Victoria. Victoria regulates neither political donations nor disclosure. The only transparency around donations is this country's weak federal laws. Donations are not published until months after the financial year in which they were made. Victorians have the right to know what is happening behind the curtain and whether the one who is paying the piper is the one calling the tune, particularly when it comes to donations from developers and at a time when so much high-density residential development is taking place in Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Integrity and trust are critical not only to good government but to the public's faith in government. We are entitled to know who is paying whom and make political judgements based on knowing what is really going on. Reform is needed at the federal level. The corruption identified in New South Wales alone is enough to justify a complete overhaul of federal laws to ensure maximum transparency. A 2012 Fairfax Media analysis of returns to the Australian Electoral Commission showed that in the case of Victoria's Liberal Party just a handful of donors were publicly conceded. A mere $485,000 of the party's total income of $18.5 million for election year 2010-2011 was sourced to corporate, industry or individual donors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the reforms proposed by Senator John Faulkner to reduce the donations disclosure threshold to $1,000 and remove indexation; prohibit foreign and anonymous donations; limit the potential for 'donation splitting' across branches, divisions, and different units of parties; and require faster and more regular disclosure of donations. As Senator Faulkner said this year in a speech on the National Integrity Commission Bill:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I really do hope that the recent events in New South Wales will motivate all Australian political parties to work together for far-reaching and long overdue reform of our electoral donations, funding and expenditure laws. This will be a real challenge for our current political leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are successful overseas examples of how we can do better. Nordic governments demonstrate how transparency works. Governments there are forced to operate in the harsh light of day. Sweden gives everyone access to official records. The principle of public access to information is a very important and cross-cutting element in Sweden's political culture, constitution and legal order. It means that the public and the mediaânewspapers, radio and televisionâare entitled to receive information about state and municipal activities. It plays a key role in ensuring high levels of transparency and is crucial for effective prevention of corruption. And the public endorses this. Swedes' trust in government, over 60 per cent, is amongst the highest in the world. The principle of public access to information is expressed in various ways. Everyone is entitled to read the documents of public authorities. Officials and others who work for the state or municipalities are entitled to say what they know to outsiders. Officials and others in the service of the state or municipalities are normally entitled to disclose information to newspapers, radio and television for publication or to personally publish information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Swedish public administration provides comprehensive services of a high quality to both citizens and enterprises. The low levels of perceived and experienced corruption in Sweden are linked to the long tradition of openness and transparency of Swedish society and institutions and a strong respect for the rule of law. There is much that we can learn from the Nordic countries and transparency in governance is an excellent place to start.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  This afternoon is a good opportunity to consider the area of early childhood and vulnerabilityâthe almost somewhat mystical zero-to-five space that state and territory governments are grappling with. Increasingly the federal government, too, is realising that there is an important role in collaborating. There can be no greater priority than giving every child a start in life. That opportunity is at the heart of everything we do in this building: giving every individual, every soul, a chance at the great wealth, benefits and opportunities that this beautiful country can provide. There is no better quote than that of Shonkoff and Phillips in their 2000 work looking at childhood vulnerability, when they said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Virtually every aspect of early human development, from the brain's evolving circuitry to the child's capacity for empathy, is affected by the environments and experiences that are encountered in a cumulative fashion, beginning early in the prenatal period and extending throughout â¦ early childhood â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What they are saying is that there is an almost dose-like effect of early intervention from family that is essential for a child to arrive at school and be able to function, cope and benefit. Where that is not the caseâwhere family circumstances, for whatever reason, do not offer thatâthen we have significant social challenges for our families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, if we reinvented the whole school system, we would probably start children a little younger than the age of six. We are increasingly realising that the decisions we make for children in the first five years of their lives have a huge impact on how expensive it is to educate children over that age. But, alas, we cannot rethink our school system and current budgets are difficult to move, so instead there has been a shift in focus towards the early years because we know that the outcomes from those investments are far richer and offer far more potential. The long-term Abecedarian work, led in part by Joe Sparling from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the United States, in multiple scenarios worldwide, regardless of culture, has shown that regular, purposeful, bilateral stimulation of young children where they are not getting it at home really can change trajectories and, in some cases, move these highest risk kids to performing even better than those who have no intervention at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many will tell you, we start in life with various levels of opportunity, high and low. Some children with high levels of opportunity go on a falling trajectory, usually owing to poor parenting. There is no guarantee that starting off well will mean that you get through school and into life successfully. By the same token, we see children coming from very poor circumstances and some of themâparadoxically, strangelyâsimply rise up to perform to the mean or even surpass it because of the quality and intensity of their parenting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No state can step in and start telling every parent how to parent, but a state is responsible for ensuring that, if there are decent services and opportunities provided, well-meaning parents accepting parenting payments from the state will demonstrate some reciprocity by accessing those services and giving their kids a start. There is no doubt that, if you speak to some of these truly high-need parents, all of them, bar the most incapacitated, will say, 'I want to do whatever is right for my child.' I just appreciate that, in highly complex and dysfunctional lives, sometimes that does not really translate to reality. To assist, we do need to have a specific focus on kids where the parenting is not quite as good as it could beâand there is no need to start judging. No. There is just an essential element here of public reporting where families are struggling. It should not just be left to the doctor. It should not just be left to the child protection worker. We are not talking about physical or sexual abuse; we are simply talking about a deficiency in parenting leading to a child basically not being able to cope at school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Shonkoff has shown in his early work and as the work of many great academics around the world has shown, the actions in those first five years really determine whether a child can emotionally self regulate and sit in a classroom without beating up the kid next to them or throwing furniture through a window. You can imagine what impact a large class having one, two or three children who are suffering in such a way has on a teacher. What is quite alarming is that work out of Canada, particularly by Paul Kershaw, showed that even in the most wealthy developed economies like Canada, over 25 per cent of children were vulnerable and potentially at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These numbers will have an extraordinary impact on our future economic planning because, as Kershaw pointed out, a failure to invest at that age means the very same kids who struggle through school, who tear down the others in the class and who drain the resources of teachers and principals will end up as teen pregnancy cases at the hospital or will end up with a curriculum vitae of crime greater than capacity and, ultimately, will never get into college or further education. They themselves are then denied a fulfilling family life when their children have exactly the same experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We make very general and superficial observations about intergenerational welfare. But, at the heart of it, instead of just hating people who do not have a job, why not go back to the root cause? We have to be looking at the epigenetic impact of young children coming from extremely disadvantaged circumstances where even in the antenatal period young mums are simply unable to give the care to those children that you and I and everybody else here probably takes for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the ABS does vulnerability studies, where it looks for levels of economic poverty, and we look at the AEDI carried out by prep teaches all around the country to identify within classes the proportion of children that are vulnerable and then lastly we look at the LSAC, the longitudinal study of children, what we are learning increasingly is that targeted interventions are highly effective. Today, in the time that I have, I want to sketch out what this service would look like because right now state governments ask: is it all to fall upon our shoulders? The federal government, paradoxically, is investing huge amounts of health resources through Medicare but most of it does not actually reach these children who are in greatest need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In general principles, what I propose today is that doctors around the country together with the college of general practice and AMA need to have a renewed focus on childhood vulnerability when assessing children who come in for immunisation. If you are going to see every child in the country at 18 months of age, why not take the time to do a small parent survey, a red flag test for child development. Potentially, where there is any risk at all a PEDS test could be carried out by one of the doctors, one of the staff members or a health clinic staff member at a public health service. They would simply be identifying vulnerability for which Medicare has generous paymentsâteam based care, chronic disease management, and access to allied health services. It is just a matter of unlocking Medicare resources for children instead of that very so short-sighted view that these chronic disease care plans only apply to adults. That is not the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any condition in any Australian citizen likely to last more than six months is eligible for a chronic disease plan. Children should not be denied those services. There is $138 for the care plan, $220 for team based arrangements and five visits to allied health services. That would surely be enough to pull those vulnerable children into a system of wraparound care. The elements of that care really should be that they are ensuring some form of single accountability somewhere. I hope the new primary health care networks will be fulfilling that role so that if there is a care plan developed by GP for a child at risk, it makes its way to a central area that ensures that child care, and that educational services are in some way coordinated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that services start right from birth if not beforehand. If health workers see in our antenatal clinics mums at risk, please identify them and the siblings of the expected child to ensure that that they are offered the services they need. I am not talking about lazy parents; I am talking about parents who live in extremely complex situationsâusually a caregiver with a mental illness or a partner who is in and out of jail or closely spaced kids in the context of poverty. These children just do not get the stimulation they need from their caregivers. In those cases we need a more flexible response. We have seen in the Challis model and through Minderoo Foundation in Western Australia an ability to pull in the services as they are designed to be by Professor Fiona Stanley. What we have seen is that the most at-risk children can end up with an educational performance that surpasses the mean of non-at-risk kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there needs to be an element of risk management which stratifies these children and ensures that, if there is any element of physical or sexual abuse, that is catered for under state legislation and immediately trumps the work in vulnerability, because there is no excuse for not treating physical or sexual abuse of a child as the absolutely pre-eminent issue, as I know state entities endeavour to do at the moment. What we also need is a tailored dosing. We do not need simply to say five visits to an allied health provider for every child. We need to have that central care navigator ensuring that these children get the support they need from zero to five, after which we can rely on the education system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have got to build the confidence in child care. Childcare workers can play a role. It should not be simply thrown onto the medical or the health system, because appropriately trained early educators can deliver many of these internationally proven services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, within the system we need goals. We need fidelity of this system to ensure we do not miss kids. You cannot rely on finding cases, as we have looked at in the childcare centre. We cannot rely purely on GPs. But, together with a coordinated scheme, we can ensure that no Australian child is left behind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="008K0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  I rise in this chamber tonight to discuss and to talk about the very important India-Australia relationship, a relationship between Australia, the oldest and most stable democracy in the Asian region, and India, the world's biggest democracy. I also want to highlight how Australia has been enriched by Indian migrants to Australia and to discuss and to point out a long-running grievance that both India and the Indian people have shared for many years. This is their lack of success in gaining a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 21st century is shaping to be the Asian century. Both Australia and India are growing economies located on the Indian Ocean rim, which is home to more than 2.6 billion people, almost 40 per cent of the world's population. According to 2011 modelling by the Asian Development Bank, Asia's GDP will increase from $17 trillion in 2010 to $174 trillion in 2050, or half of global GDP. India and Australia are positioned to benefit from this extraordinary growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia there is a rapidly growing Indian community. This is certainly true in my electorate of Holt. According to the 2011 census, approximately 295,000 people living in Australia were born in India, and there are about 390,000 people of Indian ancestry. In 2011, those migrating from India were the largest source of permanent migration to Australia, forming 15.7 per cent of the total migration program in 2011-12. According to the 2011 census there were 11,116 people of Indian ancestry residing in my federal electorate of Holt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indian migrants have made a profound contribution to Australia. We see the contribution that the Indian community makes in so many forms, be it in the fields of science, medicine, law or other fields. You also see the richness and the vibrancy of their culture in festivals like the Holi festival at the Carrum Downs temple, or the Diwali festival, the festival of lights, which is coming soon. It will be held this Saturday at the same temple. I celebrate those events with the community at this temple, which is called the Shri Shiva Vishnu temple, in Carrum Downs. It is an exquisite, almost iconic temple, and one that attracts many visitors from all over the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, India and its 1.25 billion citizens can no longer be described as a middle power. Rather, on any objective assessment, it is on the threshold of gaining substantial power status, and the international community is recognising this. It is clear that India's size and global importance justify a place or a position where they are warranted recognition in world politics. India is set to overtake China as the world's most populated country by around 2028. It is the world's biggest democracy. Its economy is the world's third largest in terms of GDP purchasing power parity. India is currently the world's third largest military spender in purchasing power parity terms, and this is growing significantly, with the country being the world's largest arms importer. India also has an independent capability to place satellites in orbit, including production of the necessary launch vehicle, as well as having one of its satellites reach and orbit Mars just last month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a long-time leader amongst the developing world, India has consistently advocated for another equality inspired focal point of the UN: global poverty alleviation. The country is now an emerging aid donor itself. India is also one of the largest constant contributors of troops to United Nations peacekeeping missions, with more than 100,000 troops having served in UN missions during the past 50 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My confidence in India's growing power is also shared by US President Barack Obama, who stated in his address to the Indian Parliament in 2010âand I would mirror these sentiments:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">India's treasured pastâa civilization that's been shaping the world for thousands of years. Indians unlocked the intricacies of the human body and the vastness of our universe. It's no exaggeration to say that our Information Age is rooted in Indian innovationsâincluding the number zero.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Of course, India not only opened our minds, she expanded our moral imaginationsâwith religious texts that still summon the faithful to lives of dignity and discipline, with poets who imagined a future 'where the mind is without fear and the head is held high' and with a man whose message of love and justice enduresâthe father of your nation, Mahatma Gandhi.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">An ancient civilization of science and innovation; a fundamental faith in human progressâthis is the sturdy foundation upon which you have built ever since that stroke of midnight when the tricolor was raised over a free and independent India. And despite the skeptics who said this country was simply too poor, or too vast, or too diverse to succeed, you surmounted overwhelming odds and became a model to the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Instead of slipping into starvation, you launched a Green Revolution that fed millions. Instead of becoming dependent on commodities and exports, you invested in science and technology and in your greatest resourceâthe Indian people. And the world sees the results, from the supercomputers you build to the Indian flag that you put on the moon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Instead of resisting the global economy, you became one of its enginesâreforming the licensing raj and unleashing an economic marvel that has lifted tens of millions of people from poverty and created one of the world's largest middle classes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Just as others, including the United States, supported Indian independence, India championed the self-determination of peoples from Africa to Asia as they, too, broke free from colonialism. And along with the United States, you've been a leader in supporting democratic development and civil society groups around the world. And this, too, is part of India's greatness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting that we in the Labor Party have a direct and profound linkage with the Indian community. John Ashmore Evatt was born in Kanpur India, in 1851, just six years before the famous Indian rebellion against the British in that town. Eventually Evatt would move to Sydney and raise a family. It is unlikely he would have had any idea the great heights his son Herbert Vere would reach in the new country. HV 'Doc' Evatt, of course, went on to play a crucial role as Australia's representative in the establishment of the United Nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Evatt's relevance for our relationship with India is not confined to his family history. More importantly, his achievements on the international front reveal a moral overlap between India and Australia, particularly under the Labor Party. Throughout the lifetime of the United Nations, two of its greatest supporters have been India and Australia. This enthusiasm for multilateralism was no coincidence. It was a product of our shared interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another value shared by Australia, India and the UN is equality in the international realm. India's first leaders had cut their political teeth fighting for equality and independence, a fight supported by Australia under Labor Prime Minister Chifley. This struggle fired India's support for a multilateral system that offered a more democratic and egalitarian model for international relations than the 'survival of the fittest' thinking that led to two world wars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">India enthusiastically supported the UN's role in doing away with the vestiges of colonialism and racial inequality, in every corner of the world. This was particularly so in relation to apartheid in South Africa, a fight that had arguably led to the politicisation of Gandhi himself, during his time there. Australia's Labor government under Hawke played a lead role amongst Western nations in applying the economic pressure that helped to ultimately undo the repressive apartheid regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">India occupies a unique position and gives enormous weight to the Indo-Pacific regionâour region, the new centre of world growth. India has been elected seven times to the UN Security Council. It is not only the world's largest democracy, as I have said. It has the third largest armed force. But it is also the world's largest Hindu nation and the world's second-largest Muslim nation. But an incongruity remains, and that is: this large, emerging democratic powerâthe largest democracy on the earthâdoes not have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there has been some discussion, particularly led by my predecessor, Gareth Evans, about reforming the UN Security Council. But I would ask, in the shadow of Deepavali, that magnificent festival that is going to be held very shortlyâin fact, this weekend, as I have said, at the Shri Shiva Vishnu Temple in Carrum Downsâmight it be time for the world community to seriously recognise India's unique and evolving role in the world architecture, the architecture of the United Nations, and set aside a place for it as a permanent member of the UN Security Council?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have laid before this place India's unique history, its unique place in the world, and its growing, substantive status in world affairs. It plays a key role in this emerging Asian era, and I would strongly urge that it be given a seat on the UN Security Council as a matter of priority.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="TK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SOUTHCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I rise to talk about the health system in Australia and to draw on a couple of reports which came out in June 2014, which would allow us to have an overall view on how the health system in Australia is performing. The Commonwealth Fund released a survey in June this year. In this regular survey which comes out from the Commonwealth Fund they did an international comparison of 11 countries, and gave Australia an overall ranking of fourth among the 11 countries. Australia was ranked second on quality care, after the UK. As is generally the case in these surveys, the United States ranked 11th of 11 countries. But Australia ranked quite wellâfourthâand second on quality care after the UK. The United Kingdom performed very strongly on that measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also there was a report that came out from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on the state of our health. That looked at a number of things which we can celebrate as great successes over the last 20 or 30 years. When we look at life expectancies for men and women, they are some of the highest in the OECD. We have seen smoking rates fall dramatically. We have seen a 20 per cent fall in heart attack rates, just in four years, from 2007 to 2011. We have seen that, over the last three decades, death rates from coronary heart disease have fallen by 73 per cent. And over just a 12-year period we have seen that the rates of stroke events have fallen by 25 per cent, or a quarter. The rate of death from stroke has fallen by almost 70 per cent since 1979.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are still some areas where we can do better. Seventy per cent of all cardiovascular disease mortality is due to the combined effects of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and physical inactivity. There are estimated to be one million people in Australia with diabetes, and there are likely to be at least another quarter of a million with undiagnosed diabetes. On top of that, there would be at least as many again of Australians with prediabetesâand there is evidence, from Finland and other countries, that intensive physical activity, weight loss and changes to lifestyle can actually delay or even prevent the development of diabetes for people with prediabetes. But when we look at diabetes we see that rates of death due to diabetes have actually risen since 1990.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have an opportunity in this grievance debate to take a step back. At the moment, the debate in health policy is very much dominated by the co-payment and Medicare. But we should be able to look at the system and say, 'How can we improve the system? How can we use the existing infrastructure of Medicare, and the soon-to-be new infrastructure of the primary care networks, to improve our system on a system-wide basis?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the debate that is occurringâincluding, think tanks and the Bennett review into the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commissionâtwo of the areas that are most obvious are chronic disease management and potentially preventable hospital admission. What we need to do is look at a way of harnessing the capacity of our existing primary care systemâthe 25,000 GPs who are working in our system and who are using Medicare as a financing mechanism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a recent article by Linda Cobiac and others in the BMC public health journal in 2012. They looked at an Australian population and cardiovascular disease prevention using an absolute risk model and found it to be more cost-effective than current guidelines. The model involves measuring absolute risk for cardiovascular disease; depending on the results, appropriate preventable medicationâsuch as blood pressure lowering drugs, or statins, to improve the lipid profileâshould be prescribed. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Vascular Disease Prevention Allianceâwhich consists of four groups: Diabetes Australia, Kidney Health Australia, the Heart Foundation and the Stroke Foundationâwas established in 2000 with the goal or reducing cardiovascular disease. They have built on this work around the absolute risk model, and in 2012 they developed guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease risk. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where is the opportunity here? In May the excellent Health Minister announced at the AMA conference that five out of the 10 existing practice incentive payments will be streamlined into a single incentive, focusing on continuous quality improvement in general practice. I have previously spoken about this. The practice incentive paymentâto explain for members of the Houseâis an add-on to Medicare. It is a payment to the practice to encourage various activities. It is not the fee for service that people are paid for the consultation; but it is to encourage other activities, prevention activities, which are not funded through a fee-for-service mechanism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously spoken about this in parliamentâthe need for a genuine quality measure. I believe there is a great opportunity to move towards a quality measure which is evidence based. We now have general practices that are widely computerised, with sophisticated practice management databases. This was initiated by Michael Wooldridge 14 or 15 years ago. General practice is now well set up to lead the adoption of an integrated health check. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This would involve having a new PIP, which could include an integrated health check for all eligible patients, including an absolute cardiovascular risk assessment diabetes check and kidney disease check. The practices would be required to manage the overall risk profile and to stratify risk within their practice. They would be required to maintain a patient register and to record and report the proportion of eligible patients who are checked and who have had their risk managed. Many of these activities are already done at a practice level but the evidence is very strong that focussing on an integrated health check is cost effective; it will help to improve the inroads we have already made into cardiovascular disease. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing the adoption of an integrated health check could be a key role for the new primary health networks. When you look at New Zealand, their primary health organisations have information which is reportable and evidence based, and which leads to changes in people being admitted to hospital and having their chronic disease managed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I rise to support the call from the National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance to have an integrated health check. I think it is something that is presently missing. There are elements of it there in the existing Medicare framework, but certainly it is a framework which can be improved on, so that we can see that our excellent primary care system is even better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberQuestion">Mr Kelvin Thomson</span>
                  </a>  asked the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, in writing, on 26 August, 2014, the following 5 questions:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Has he investigated reports in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> on 8 August 2014 that a corrupt official in his department helped run a $3 million criminal migration racket involving more than 1,000 fraudulent visa applications; if so, what action has been taken as a result of these investigations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) Is it a fact that the Government has issued new licences in the past six months to migration agents previously identified by his department as having bribed employers to obtain fake work references for visa applicants; if so, will the Government review these licences with a view to withdrawing them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) Is it a fact that Murphy Pipe and Civil has sponsored many Irish workers as 'project administrators' or in other skilled roles, but employed them as labourers, machine operators and storemen. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) What investigations has the Government conducted into claims by a whistleblower that Murphy Pipe and Civil was constantly in breach of immigration laws, by sponsoring unskilled Irish workers when unskilled workers could have been sourced locally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) Is it a fact that S and S Migration, a migration firm run by Mr Jeetender Ajjan and Mr Mahmihn Sodhani, used stolen departmental stamps and equipment as part of a scam in which hundreds of overseas workers and students paid large sums to obtain visas to which they were not entitled; if so, will the Government review visas which were issued to the clients of this firm and cancel those which have been issued as a result of fraud.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr Morrison:</span>
                  </a>  The answer to the honourable member's questions are:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The case that this question relates to was the subject of a departmental investigation. At the conclusion of an investigation, it is practice for a brief of evidence to be forwarded to the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecution (CDPP) for their consideration. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority has responsibility for registering migration agents, ensuring they abide by the Code of Conduct for professional and ethical practice, and are fit and proper to be registered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is inappropriate to comment on allegations about the conduct of individual registered migration agents until any investigation is finalised. Any registered agent found to have assisted visa applicants to obtain fraudulent work references in support of their visa; will be the subject of strong disciplinary sanctions which can include cancellation or suspension of their registration. An agent, who ceases to be registered during an investigation, can be barred from registering for a maximum period of five years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(3) All businesses that sponsor subclass 457 visa holders are required to comply with the sponsorship obligations. These obligations include the requirement to ensure that visa holders are provided at least the same terms and conditions of employment as those that are provided to an equivalent Australian citizen employee as well as ensuring visa holders are only employed in the occupation for which they are approved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Department is aware of the allegations made against Murphy Pipe and Civil Constructions Pty Ltd and is investigating the claims made by Fairfax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) The specific allegations regarding Murphy Pipe and Civil Constructions Pty Ltd are currently being investigated by the Department.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Department takes any alleged breach of subclass 457 visa sponsorship obligations very seriously and investigates appropriately. If a sponsor is found to have failed an obligation, the Department institutes appropriate action, which may take the form of imposing administrative sanctions, issuing infringement notices, executing enforceable undertakings or applying to the federal court for a civil penalty order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) On 26 October 2011, the Department, with assistance from the Australian Federal Police, executed search warrants on a business premise in the Melbourne CBD, a residential premise in Taylors Hills and an apartment in the Docklands area, south-west of Melbourne CBD. During the execution of the search warrants a number of items were identified and seized. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is standard procedure to review all relevant visa applications and decisions that are connected to investigations into migration fraud, and such reviews were conducted as a result of the investigation into S and S Migration.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) A general dispensation from aviation screening requirements is not available to the general public. All travellers are required to be screened and cleared in accordance with aviation security legislation. The Australian Government recognises the special needs of some travellers and the arrangements identified in (1) above have been put in place to: facilitate the screening process in the most comfortable and timely way possible; and ensure required security outcomes are achieved. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(5) At international gateway airports, body scanners are available to travellers with special needs, including those travellers with a pacemaker or other medical implant. Body scanners use different technology to metal detectors and travellers with pacemakers can be screened with a body scanner. Where a body scanner is used to screen a person with a pacemaker, a frisk search will not be required as the primary screening method.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, as a body scanner screens for anomalies on the body of a person, travellers with metal implants will not alarm in the same way, or as often, when screened with the body scanner as compared to a metal detector. This means that it is less likely that a traveller with metal implants will need to undergo a frisk search to resolve an alarm.</span>
