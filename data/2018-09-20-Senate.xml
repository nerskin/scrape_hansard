                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RICE:</span>
                    </a>  The Senate yesterday passed an order for production of documents, for the final report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel. This was rejected by the government late last night, on the grounds that the report informed and was the subject of cabinet deliberation, and therefore the public interest immunity claim was made. The reason for moving this motion today is that we reject that, for the reasons that I just outlined in the motion. The community needs to see this report. In fact, it is in the public interest for this report to be tabled. It is not in the public interest for this report to continue to be hidden. The government, by hiding this report, is putting people's lives—particularly the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people—on hold. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has had the final report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel for four months now. We all know the circumstances in which the Ruddock review, the expert panel, was set up. It was as a consequence of the successful passing of the marriage equality legislation. The marriage equality legislation, as we know, removed the largest state-sanctioned discrimination against LGBTIQ people, in allowing us to get married. In response to that, there was some unhappiness on the government benches, particularly among those in the right wing on the government benches. There was a bit of a sense that we need to work out the whole issue of balancing the issue of religious freedom and religious discrimination. That's why the Ruddock review was set up. It is extremely important for LGBTIQ people, in particular, to know what that review has found, to know what Mr Ruddock is recommending to government and then to see what the government's response is, because this review and the government's response to it have potentially huge impacts on the lives of LGBTIQ people. At the moment, they are being kept in the dark. They are being left in the lurch. We do not know whether the Ruddock review is recommending further discrimination against LGBTIQ people, further discrimination that would allow schools, hospitals, aged-care centres, florists and bakers to further discriminate against LGBTIQ people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why it is now so important that the Australian people know this is the comments of Prime Minister Morrison in recent weeks, where he has indicated that he, in fact, wants to further discriminate against LGBTIQ people. He wants to wind back some of our antidiscrimination laws which protect LGBTIQ people from discrimination. It is extremely important that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people know the extent of the recommendations from Philip Ruddock and to what extent the Prime Minister is planning to further discriminate against them. We know that this debate, about how religious freedom and religious discrimination weigh up against each other, is something that is of critical importance in our antidiscrimination laws going forward. In the Senate inquiry into marriage equality last year there was universal recognition that we need to protect religion as a protected attribute. Of course everybody should have the right to hold a religion and express their religion, but there is a great deal of debate about how the impacts of the manifestation of their religion upon other people should be managed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens position is that we need to have a charter of rights, so that we can balance people's right to have a religion versus people's right to not be discriminated against. That's the direction we need to be heading in. They're the discussions that the community needs to be having. If we had that charter of rights discussion we could be moving forward. We were hopeful that the Ruddock review might provide some information that would work out where the community debate should go, but in order to provide that information we need to see the report. We do not need to be kept in the dark. We need to let that report see the light of day. It is four months now that the government has had that report. Why isn't it releasing it now? We have been told for a number of months to expect it quite soon, but one has to ask: what is the government hiding?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are questions around the fact that we have a by-election in Wentworth coming up in a month's time. The debate has been that the government's not going to release the Ruddock review before the Wentworth by-election. We know that the people of Wentworth are very strong supporters of LGBTIQ rights, so one could surmise that maybe the government are keeping this report in secret because they actually don't want the people of Wentworth to realise what their true agenda is. The true agenda is further discrimination against LGBTIQ people in the name of religious freedom. That's what you could actually surmise. That's the ulterior motive of keeping this report hidden. If they weren't planning on doing this then why not release the report? Why not release it so we can see what Mr Ruddock has recommended. And why not then respond to it and lay to rest all these people's concerns and fears?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to go to the point of the importance of seeing the report of the Ruddock review, because there is a lot of fear in the community. LGBTIQ people across the community are worried. They are concerned. They know that achieving marriage equality was a big step forward, but they are very fearful that their rights are going to be wound back. It's not just a theoretical thing that they are worried about; it's people's actual lives—people employed as teachers in faith based schools, who are fearful of no longer having jobs; people employed in aged-care centres or hospitals, who are fearful of not even getting jobs because of their sexuality or gender identity or fearful that they will lose their jobs because of those things. Again, the Greens would like to see our laws strengthened so that people are better protected from discrimination, but we are worried, and the community is worried, that there are going to be further grounds to discriminate against people because of their sexuality or gender identity. You only have to look at the interventions of our Prime Minister over the last month to see that their fears seem to be very well grounded. When the Prime Minister sees fit to retweet an appallingly homophobic and transphobic article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span>, saying that we don't need gender whisperers in our schools, one can see the sort of intolerance the government seems to be heading to. That's what people are fearful about. They are thinking: if a Prime Minister sees fit to retweet something like that, what has he got in mind? What is he planning to do? What legislation is this government planning to put up to further vilify and discriminate against people just on the basis of their sexuality and their gender identity?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of protecting people's rights is of fundamental importance. All people, regardless of their gender identity, regardless of their sexuality, need to be treated as equals. They need to have all the opportunities other people in our society have. It's clearly going to be an ongoing debate in our community, but it needs to be a debate informed by evidence, rather than an emotive discussion based on prejudice. We need to have the basic information. The government, in initiating and setting up the review into religious freedom in the first place, had the opportunity, through doing the consultation the review has done, to put on the table a body of evidence with which we can move forward. That's the evidence we need to have. In particular, it's evidence that is needed before the people of Wentworth go to the polls in a month's time. They need to know what the Ruddock review recommended and what the government's plans are. So the motion I am moving today says: can we please move this forward? It asks all of our senators here to make sure the information is available so that we know where the power lies; so that we know what the government has planned; so that we know whether it's the fair treatment of LGBTIQ people that's on the government's agenda or whether the government's response to the question of religious freedom is one where the far right of the party have won the day and the government is planning further discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer Australians.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  The government will oppose this motion. That is because, as has long been recognised by the Senate and as has been practised by governments of both political persuasions, we believe that the principle of cabinet confidentiality, the confidentiality of cabinet deliberations, is a very important and long-established principle under the Westminster system. It is designed to ensure that cabinet ministers can debate policies and proposals freely so that the ultimate decision that is made is the best possible decision. I hasten to add here, in relation to the report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel, which has been received by the cabinet, that the government has not as yet made any decisions on the way forward. The cabinet continues with its deliberations. This is obviously a matter which is highly sensitive. It's very important for the government, in its response, to get the balance right, to get its decisions right. I think it would make it inappropriately more difficult for the government to get the balance right and to make the best possible decision in relation to this issue if the longstanding principle of cabinet confidentiality was breached in the way as is suggested in this motion. That is why I call on the Senate—and I certainly would call most respectfully on the opposition, which has acted in consistency with the principles of cabinet confidentiality under the Westminster system during its periods in government, and is likely to do so in the future—to join with the government in preserving, whether on this topic or any other topic, a very important principle: to ensure that cabinet ministers, as they deal with often very complex, sensitive and difficult issues, are in the right position to debate policy proposals and other proposals freely and, indeed, in confidence, without essentially the additional difficulty in reaching the best possible decision that would come with a premature debate in the context of no decision yet having been made. Once the government has made a decision, all of the information, quite rightly, ought to be in the public domain, but this is not yet the time, given that the cabinet has not yet made a final decision and the deliberations are ongoing.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:46</span>):  Labor, too, has concerns with the government's claim of public interest immunity on this occasion. As the minister has outlined, Labor as a party of government does regard seriously issues around cabinet confidentiality and cabinet deliberations. But there are a few issues on this occasion that I think I should highlight as to why our concerns remain on this particular matter. Firstly, in claiming public interest immunity, in response to the Senate's call of yesterday, the government hasn't outlined what harm it suggests may occur. That's a critical element of any claim of public interest immunity—to outline what harm is envisaged by this report being released. I would highlight to Minister Cormann that there are many occasions on which a government releases a report of a review before it concludes its response to that review. So we have yet to hear why, on this occasion, in relation to this review, the release of the review itself, as opposed to the cabinet's deliberation of the review, cannot be made available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to remind the Senate that there's some history to this matter. Some senators may recall that, in addressing the legislation around same-sex marriage and amendments that were put before the Senate by some senators on that occasion, I made the point that it would have been helpful to have been able to give more serious consideration to these religious freedom matters, but that the Prime Minister at the time, Prime Minister Turnbull, had, in a sense, kicked these matters down the road by establishing the Ruddock review. When that review was established, a number of senators who might've been inclined to support further work to occur in relation to introducing protections around religious freedom essentially folded into supporting the Ruddock review process as the appropriate forum under which these matters should be addressed. Remember, though, this is quite some time. The Greens have highlighted some of the concerns in relation to how we, as a nation, might proceed in the future to protect religious freedom, but there are, of course, a myriad of other concerns that the Ruddock review has considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me highlight for the Senate, for instance, that, at the commencement of the Ruddock review process, there were concerns from a number of parties that submissions were not being made public, that people weren't able to follow the proceedings, that some of the proceedings were unnecessarily secret and that the process itself had been somewhat clouded. I join with those who hold the view that the findings of that review have remained closed for too long now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might have some sympathy for concerns that say, 'Well, we've got a new Prime Minister and a new cabinet, and it needs to consider these things,' but it has been some time. I don't think this issue should be beholden to the uncertainties within the Liberal coalition government and its changes of leadership. I think these issues are more important than that, and we should have a broader, measured consideration of what was considered within the Ruddock review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, I need to reflect on issues that have been raised in a sense anecdotally around the review, because we still can't see it. One element of those reflections has been that Mr Ruddock went into that review process with an approach that was essentially: 'Where's the nuisance? I don't see the nuisance here. So, not being able to see the nuisance, I don't really see that we need to do much more than the status quo.' I was subsequently told, 'Well, no, actually the review board did identify that there was some level of nuisance, not only the issues that have been highlighted by the Greens but also issues highlighted by members of various religious communities.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, I would like to say that I'm disappointed that this process appears to be becoming politicised. Prime Minister Morrison said he wasn't going to become the Christian warrior, but, by taking as long as he has and by shrouding this review still in secrecy, these issues are now becoming politicised in a quite unnecessary way. I would like to see an opportunity for all of those who have a multitude of different views to air those views, and the best way to do that is for the review report to now be made public so we can have what I would hope would be an open, measured discussion around what those recommendations are. For that reason, Labor will be supporting the motion.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:52</span>):  Orders for the production of documents are a key oversight tool for this Senate. We've seen a number of OPDs refused by this government on very dubious grounds. I accept the principles laid out by Senator Cormann that cabinet in confidence is a well-respected doctrine in the Westminster system of government. I don't challenge him on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, let me just go to the claim that has been made by the government in this instance. They've made the claim that they can't provide the documents, on the grounds that these documents informed and are the subject of cabinet deliberations. Of course, cabinet deliberations are protected, but not necessarily things that are subject to deliberations—only the deliberations themselves. If this has not been through cabinet, it can't be a deliberation of cabinet, and it cannot attract that claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make another point, a very important point: we are a house that complies with the laws of this land. The laws of this land say that, in order for a document to be considered cabinet in confidence, it must have at birth a dominant purpose for submission to cabinet. I would like the government to come back to this chamber with some evidence that shows that, when they commissioned this report, it was intended exclusively for cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would also note that, in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cabinet Handbook</span>, cabinet submissions take a particular form, and typically cabinet submissions are limited to 50 pages. I would like to get an answer from the government in respect of this: how many pages are in this particular report? You cannot simply pass a document through the cabinet room in order to obtain a protection of cabinet in confidence. That's inappropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I would make is that there are very strict handling requirements for documents that are cabinet in confidence. There are very strict tracking requirements for documents that are cabinet in confidence. I would like the government to bring to this chamber evidence that this document has been held confidential and has been tracked in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cabinet Handbook</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>so that we can be satisfied that the claim that is being made by the government is bona fide. We cannot simply have an aroma-of-cabinet defence fettering the Senate in its legitimate oversight role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this government has consistently made claims of public interest immunity in this chamber. It should be of great concern to every member of this Senate, because when there's a change of government the people sitting on the government side will end up on the opposition side of the chamber and will want to do their job properly, informed by the documents that are paid for by the taxpayer and are commissioned for public purpose. I respect what Senator Cormann has said. I respect the claim that is made, but it must be a proper claim. I suspect in this instance that it is not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a situation at the moment where the government is in the ACT Magistrates Court claiming that the matters before that court are secret. We've had a number of instances in this chamber where the government have done the same thing, only to have their rulings overturned by people such as the Information Commissioner and the AAT. By making these false claims you undermine proper process—the very process Senator Cormann relies on not to bring these documents to the chamber. I ask for more information to be provided to the chamber. I'm inclined to support the Greens' motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Rice be agreed to.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):     Labor supports the measures in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, although we will move two small but important amendments.    The bill contains four tax measures.    Schedule 1 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law applies appropriately to artificial or contrived arrangements involving trusts and partnerships entered into by multinational entities to avoid the taxation of business profits in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure applies on or after 1 January 2016 in connection with a scheme, whether or not the scheme was entered into, or was commenced to be carried out, before that day. However, the measure does not apply in relation to tax benefits that a taxpayer derives before 1 January 2016. This is consistent with the date from which the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law applied, and the purpose of the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order for this extension to apply, the trust or partnership must have: a relationship with a foreign entity that means they are not independent of that entity at the time they make the relevant supply or supplies to their Australian customer; and a foreign entity participant at any time in an income year in which income is derived from the supply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted in the explanatory memorandum, the schedule implements a technical integrity measure underpinning the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law.    At this point, I just want to remind the Senate that the government regularly makes misleading statements that Labor voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. This is untrue. In the House, Labor voted against government-Greens political party amendments that watered down tax transparency reporting requirements for large private companies. Labor, throughout debate, supported the MAAL.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also note that the Senate has now passed Labor's private senator's bill regarding tax transparency. This will allow proper scrutiny and help restore the trust in the integrity of the tax system that was brought about when the Gillard government passed tax transparency reforms in June 2013. The Senate has voted to lower the tax transparency threshold to $50 million for all firms—public and private.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also removes a grandfathering exemption for certain financial reports for approximately 1500 large companies. Labor supported this when former Senator Ricky Muir moved it during the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law debate in 2015, where it was opposed by the Liberals and the Greens. That private senator's bill stands alongside other Labor transparency measures, including disclosure of tax haven activity in government tenders, public reporting of country-by-country reports and protection for whistleblowers who uncover tax dodging by multinationals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include additional conditions that must be satisfied to apply the small business CGT concessions to capital gains. The new conditions ensure that the small business CGT concessions in division 152 are only available for capital gains tax assets that are either used or held ready for use in the course of a small business or are an interest in a small business. These amendments implement the measure announced in the 2017-18 budget as 'Tax integrity package—improving the small business capital gains tax concessions' and apply to capital gains tax events that occur on or after 1 July 2017. That announcement followed issues raised with Treasury by the Australia Taxation Office that legislative loopholes were being exploited. The budget proposal was vague in its details. Numerous tax professionals and stakeholders have said it was not until the release of the exposure draft legislation that those affected would become aware of how they were affected. Stakeholders make the reasonable claim that, due to a lack of detail, taxpayers have conducted their tax affairs in good faith and will be caught by changes that go beyond what was flagged in the budget. In light of the stakeholder concerns, Labor is moving a detailed amendment to make the start date 8 February 2018, the date on which the exposure draft legislation was released, as proposed by the tax professional community. I will detail our amendment later in my remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill amends the income tax law and the Venture Capital Act 2002 to ensure that the venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fin-tech businesses. These amendments apply in relation to investments made on or after 1 July 2018. This schedule partially implements the National Innovation and Science Agenda measure, expanding the new arrangements for venture capital limited partnerships from the 2016-17 budget. In the light of feedback received in the course of our consultations, Labor will be moving an amendment to this schedule of the bill. This amendment will require the minister to instigate an impact assessment of the venture capital tax concession provisions overhaul, and include the measures in schedule 3 to this bill to ensure that they are operating as intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the payments received from the Commonwealth as reparation for abuse by Australian Defence Force personnel. This measure applies to the 2017-18 income year and later income years, and implements the tax consequences from the 2017-18 budget of the Defence Force Ombudsman continuation and expansion measure. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce was established on 10 April 2011 to assess and respond to individual cases of sexual and other abuse in the Australian Defence Force. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce administered reparation payments through the Defence Reparation Scheme of up to $50,000 to complainants who likely suffered abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Reparation payments were not paid as compensation for loss or damage for any asserted, perceived or possible legal liability on behalf of the Commonwealth or for any injury, disease or impairment. The payments did not affect complainants' statutory common law or other legal rights. This measure amends the tax law to exempt from income tax the payments made in accordance with a recommendation of the Defence Force Ombudsman in relation to abuse by Australian Defence Force personnel. Labor supports this measure in schedule 4.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the two amendments that Labor will move to this bill in relation to schedule 2 and schedule 3. Labor will move an amendment relating to the small-business capital gains tax concession measures in schedule 2. Stakeholders have informed Labor that the additional conditions for eligibility for the capital gains tax concessions are detailed in a way that make the changes more akin to a policy change rather than an integrity change, and, as such, capture taxpayers who engaged in good faith according to the intent of the concessions. Further, the active asset tests for eligibility interact with a longer run issue of tax office interpretation and application of the active test. This issue flared up when the ATO appeared to change its interpretation of 'act of business/asset' in a footnote to the draft taxation ruling TR2017/D2—a matter that has not been resolved. Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand noted in language comparable to other stakeholders:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed measure would deny "access to the concessions for assets which are unrelated to [a taxpayer's] small business, for instance through arranging their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the tests for determining eligibility for the concessions". No further information was released until the publication of this exposure draft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures contained in the exposure draft are extraordinarily complex. More importantly, in our view they go beyond what taxpayers could reasonably have expected from the Budget announcement designed to address "integrity" concerns. They reduce what many stakeholders would regard as the intended scope of the concessions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… … …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… taxpayers have in good faith sold, or entered into agreements to sell, interests in entities on the basis that they qualified for the concessions but will not now do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tax Institute, Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, partners at large accounting firms and small businesses have all argued that, to prevent adverse consequences for taxpayers who have acted in good faith but could not reasonably have been expected to foresee the detailed amendments that were finally unveiled in the exposure draft, the implementation date should be changed from 1 July 2017, as per the budget announcement, to 8 February 2018, the date of the exposure draft release.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of the stakeholders' concerns, Labor is moving a detailed amendment to make the start date 8 February 2018. We flagged the need for this change when the bill was debated in the House. Labor will also move an amendment in relation to schedule 3. This amendment requires the minister to instigate an impact assessment of the venture capital tax concession provisions overall and to include the measures in this bill to ensure they are operating as intended. This impact assessment would be conducted by Treasury and Innovation and Science Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of the Senate, I want to note some comments by the member for Chifley in the other place when debate was underway on this bill. The member for Chifley said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The sector and people in the sector have raised with me that they're not entirely happy with what's been put forward in this bill. Again, it's a straightforward measure, but they still don't think that it's picked up their concerns. For example—and I had highlighted to me—in 3.26 of the explanatory memorandum it states that a fin-tech may be eligible for the tax concession when developing its technology. However—and this is what has been raised with me—it then goes on to say that when a business is commercialising the technology it would no longer be eligible. As has been raised with me: 'This hardly seems like a certain, longer term platform for a venture capital firm to make an investment in a fin-tech, given that the VC is only making the investment because it's hoping the fin-tech will be able to commercialise and profit from the technology.' This is what they're raising with me, and I'm sure they have raised it with Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Chifley raised important concerns about the government's processes. This reflects why we believe it is important to have a review. We also note concerns about the government's process. The member for Chifley noted in the other place:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… what I have been finding out when talking with stakeholders about this is how long it took to get to this point—how long it took for this straightforward move to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that FinTech Australia put out a policy paper on this issue on in February 2016. The government announced this in their 2016-17 budget, but it was not until October 2017 that the government started to consult on amendments. It is concerning that this whole process has taken so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's position strikes the right balance: we support this particular measure, but we will also be moving an amendment requiring the government to have a comprehensive and transparent review of the venture capital tax concession framework. In conclusion, Labor supports the measures in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. However, we will be moving sensible amendments to the bill, which we commend to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. I thank Senator Cameron for his contribution and the fact that those opposite will be supporting this bill, albeit they will be moving some amendments to it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is tax integrity important? Tax integrity is vital because it gives people confidence in our economic system and it means that taxes can be maintained at as low a level as possible. If everyone is paying the amount of tax they are required to pay then taxpayers are not burdened. Those who do pay their tax, who follow the rules, are not burdened with unduly high taxes. So tax integrity is an essential measure of fairness in a modern economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a strong track record of defending the integrity of the tax system, to make sure it collects the tax that is required to be paid—and no more than that—so that no-one in society is burdened with an unfair level of taxation because others are breaking the rules. The government has a strong track record of defending the integrity of the tax system not just in this bill but previously, and before I go into this bill in detail I'll just run through some of the things that this government has done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislation passed includes such things as the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, the BEAR, ensuring that senior executives are accountable for the decisions they make. That was a very significant reform in Australia's financial services history. It imposed a higher standard of behaviour on banks and their senior executives and directors. It strengthened the leadership of financial system regulators through enabling ASIC and APRA each to have a second deputy chair position. That is the case at APRA, where John Lonsdale, a 30-year Treasury veteran, has been appointed. And Daniel Crennan QC has already started in his role at ASIC as a special prosecutor focusing on enforcement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have created a one-stop shop for dispute resolution with the establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, enabling more consumers to access fast and free dispute resolution. We have increased the powers of APRA in relation to crisis management and non-bank lenders to ensure the resilience and ongoing stability of the Australian financial system. We have capped commissions paid on life insurance products to prevent unnecessary churn. We have raised the professional education and ethical standards of financial advisers. We have put a ban on excessive credit card surcharges, to protect consumers from being granted excessive credit limits and building unsustainable debt across credit cards, and simplified how interest is calculated. We have implemented funds for Australian regional transport. We have moved to establish a crowdsourced equity funding regime to allow new businesses to get access to funding in new and innovative ways. We have introduced industry funding for ASIC through levies and fees for regulatory activities. We are also looking to strengthen protection for whistleblowers who expose corporate and tax misconduct. We have enhanced ASIC's ability to attract and retain the best staff by removing ASIC employees from the Public Service Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the relaxation of the legislative 15 per cent ownership cap as well as establishing a streamlined approval path for recent entrants so as to reduce barriers to innovative new fin-techs in the banking sector. There is extending the crowdsourced equity funding regime to propriety companies to help smaller financial institutions to grow and become more significant players in the banking sector. We're improving superannuation accountability and member outcomes, including strengthening regulator powers, improving disclosure, removing restrictions on choice of funds and lifting governance standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also moving to protect individual superannuation savings from disproportionately high fees and insurance premiums and empowering the ATO to reunite people with their lost and inactive super. This is a strong track record of delivering positive outcomes in the financial services space particularly and, obviously, in tax integrity. Making sure that all parts of the economy pay the correct amount of tax through tax integrity measures is vitally important. We've already taken significant action on this, particularly as regards multinationals, and that is, in part, what the bill in front of us goes to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill toughens the multinational anti-avoidance law—the MAAL law. This schedule makes technical amendments to ensure that the multinational anti-avoidance law operates as it was intended to. As a result of this amendment, multinationals will no longer be able to use corporate structures with foreign trusts and partnerships to avoid the application of the multinational anti-avoidance law. These changes were announced in last year's budget. The government is committed to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax. The OECD estimated that, globally, between $100 billion and $240 billion of corporate tax revenues is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies used by multinationals. As part of the global effort to combat multinational tax avoidance, the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project has delivered a number of recommendations to strengthen tax integrity rules and ensure that the international tax system works as intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2015, Australia has implemented a range of such actions. The government has also taken action on multinational tax avoidance beyond the OECD recommendations, including implementing the multinational anti-avoidance law and the diverted profits tax, both of which discourage large multinationals from artificially diverting profits offshore. The multinational anti-avoidance law took effect from 1 January 2016 and prevents multinationals from escaping Australian tax by using artificial or contrived arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence in Australia. The ATO has observed a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government. The ATO estimates more than $7 billion in sales revenue annually is already being added to the Australian tax base as a result of these changes. Thirty-eight multinational entities have changed, or are in the process of changing, their tax affairs to bring their Australian source sales back onshore in compliance with the multinational anti-avoidance law, including Google and Facebook. Obviously, taxing these large multinationals with innovative models of doing business—the way they're structured and the way their businesses operate—is different to what the tax system was used to dealing with. So it's important that, as the business environment changes, governments are responsive enough to change the tax environment with it to ensure that everyone does pay their fair share of tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 improves the integrity of the small-business capital gains tax concessions. In the 2017-18 budget the government announced that it would improve integrity and ensure that the small-business capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted. The goal was to ensure that the concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small businesses. The proposed amendments will mean the small-business capital gains tax concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to supporting small businesses through tax cuts and initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which was extended in last year's budget for a further 12 months to 30 June 2018. The small-business capital gains tax concessions assist owners of small businesses by providing relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of assets related to their business. This helps them to reinvest and grow as well as to contribute to their retirement savings through the sale of the business. The concessions themselves are not changing and will be available to genuine small-business taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets less than $6 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key features of the new law include: a limitation on the size of the company or trust being disposed of, to ensure that it is a genuine small business; clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interests in the company or trust, to ensure that taxpayers do not benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote; and modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares to companies or interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities. That prevents the concessions from being available when most of the value of the company or trust is unrelated to small-business activity. Additional integrity rules also apply to ensure that the new tests cannot be manipulated or avoided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill covers amendments to the fin-tech and venture capital arrangements. This delivers on a key commitment in the government's fin-tech statement, removing ambiguity from the tax law and clarifying that early stage venture capital limited partnerships can invest in Australian fin-tech businesses. This bill builds on the government's $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda and highlights our commitment to support innovative businesses in Australia and build a culture of entrepreneurship and risk-taking. It will improve access to venture capital for fin-tech start-ups and assist these businesses to grow and succeed. I certainly know that in my home state of WA we are seeing a lot of very exciting developments in these kinds of spaces where venture capital and financial tech firms are seeking to access and innovate based on new technologies—things like blockchain, which many of us have heard about and probably not very many of us understand. Giving these businesses the opportunity to invest, take a risk and build a business that hasn't existed in the past are things this government very much supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 covers the tax exemption for payments under the Defence Force Ombudsman scheme. This commends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to continue to exempt from income tax payments made as reparations to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Unlike compensation, a reparation payment represents an acknowledgement by Defence that the abuse suffered by the complainants was wrong, that it can have a lasting a serious impact and that, in the past, Defence was not positioned appropriately to respond to that abuse in many cases. The recipient of a reparation payment should receive the full benefit of that payment and, as such, the payment should be exempt from income tax. Previous reparations made under the former Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were tax exempt. The task force concluded on 31 August 2016 and, in the 2017-18 budget, the government announced it was expanding the Defence Force Ombudsman role to make recommendations on reparation payments in relation to complaints of abuse in Defence. The Defence Force Ombudsman may make recommendations on historical cases of abuse occurring on or before 30 June 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, just as we want those who should pay their correct amount of tax to do so, we don't want people who are receiving a payment from the government to have to pay tax where it is inappropriate for tax to be paid. A reparation payment of this sort to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force falls into that category. We want to collect tax from those who should pay it and we don't want to be taxing those who shouldn't. In that way, we'll be able to keep our tax system as fair as we can and only claim the minimal amount of tax we need to deliver those essential services that Australians want and need and not a penny more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also announced a number of other significant reforms in this area. Again, we see that this is a government getting on with the job of delivering for all Australians. It announced reforms including increasing the civil and criminal penalties for financial misconduct—the most significant increases for the maximum civil penalties in many cases in more than 20 years. These include criminal penalties for individuals of up to 10 years imprisonment and, for corporations, criminal penalties the larger of $9.45 million, three times the benefit or 10 per cent of annual turnover. So there are significant increases in the potential penalties that will be faced both by individuals and corporations. Other reforms announced include imposing design and distribution obligations to ensure products sold by financial institutions are designed for and marketed to an identified target market to minimise the likelihood of consumers purchasing unsuitable products. Also announced was a product intervention power for ASIC to enable the regulator to intervene where products could pose significant consumer harm. Obviously, we want a system where people understand what they are purchasing and purchase things that are appropriate for their financial circumstances. The more information we have in the marketplace about these products, the more informed decisions consumers can make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've announced a move to extend unfair contract term protections to insurance contracts. We've also announced further reforms to combat illegal phoenixing activity. Phoenixing is the activity where a business closes down and restarts pretty much on the same day and in the same premises. We've also allowed the early release of superannuation rules on compassionate grounds and financial hardship grounds. The government has also recently increased ASIC's funding by $70 million to equip it with the resources and powers it needs. We need to detect, deter and punish those who do the wrong thing. We need to ensure that all companies pay the correct amount of tax under the law. In that way, we can keep taxes as low as possible for everybody.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  The Australian economy needs entrepreneurs. The parliament should foster an entrepreneurial spirit and give a fair go to those who are weighing up the risks of starting a business. Entrepreneurs are prepared to take risks to be successful and drive the economy. Entrepreneurs and small businesses should be supported and given confidence to invest and grow—for example, in collaborative structures with other businesses. We should not punish those entrepreneurs who worked hard in small businesses and made substantial contributions to Australia's economy in the process. It is unfortunate that that will be a consequence of Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018 as currently drafted. I will return to that in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new rules would act as a disincentive to growth, hurting thousands of small businesses—the very people our Prime Minister says are the engine of economic growth and jobs. Whilst I agree with the intention of the bill—that big businesses and wealthy individuals should not be able to access tax concessions designed to help small businesses grow—the bill also unintentionally smuggles in policy by stealth. It's actually misleading to suggest that these changes are merely an integrity measure. No-one wants to see loopholes in the law erode the tax base, but this legislation does appear to have adverse consequences for some small-business people who deserve support to grow and be successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that there are genuine small-business people who will no longer be able to claim appropriate tax relief as a result of this bill. I've had numerous consultations with business groups, in particular with Business SA, on this issue. They have cited that many of their members now face capital gains tax of hundreds of thousands of dollars each when they sell their share in their businesses, which can often be their entire retirement nest egg. The amendment I will seek to have passed will remedy that concern by making the new restrictions only apply to taxpayers who have significant other wealth, not to genuine small-business people who have worked hard to grow a business and employ Australians along the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time as we debate these issues, a review is taking place by the Board of Taxation that will provide recommendations into precisely the issues being put forward in the bill. That review will:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… identify ways to improve small business tax concessions to ensure they remain effective, easily accessible, and well-targeted. … including how the small business tax concessions complement retirement savings policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes no sense to me that we would rush this bill through the Senate before that analysis is made available next month. The Senate could make an informed decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has declared, as the benchmark for his administration, that he will give 'a fair go to those prepared to have a go'. According to Business SA, there are thousands of people in South Australia alone who have demonstrably had a go, who are inadvertently affected by this bill as it currently stands. Through their enterprises they have built businesses, employed South Australians and contributed to the prosperity of the state. What they now face, should this legislation be passed as currently drafted, is anything but a fair go. I urge the Senate to support the amendment I will be proposing or, at the very least, to delay passage of the bill until proper consideration can be made and consultations with stakeholders are held, in particular in reference to the Board of Taxation recommendations, to ensure that people who have made a lifetime contribution to the economy do not suffer the unintended consequences of this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. We on this side of the chamber believe in lower taxes and in entrepreneurship. We believe in the hard work and aspiration of everyday Australians who want to get ahead. We know that lower taxes and more entrepreneurship are good for the economy, good for jobs and good for innovation. That's why this government has committed to and has delivered tax relief for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as for working families, through reductions in company and personal income tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This agenda of lowering taxes is working. Australia's unemployment rate is at 5.3 per cent, the lowest level since the peak of the mining boom. Well over one million jobs have been created since the coalition government was elected five years ago, and we have the strongest economic growth in the OECD. But, while we firmly believe that taxes should be low, we also believe that taxes must be paid. That's why this government has legislated a range of measures to combat multinational tax avoidance. They include a diverted profits tax; the establishment of a tax avoidance task force; strengthened international transfer pricing rules; increased penalties for multinationals who engage in profit shifting; and new whistleblower protections. The Australian Taxation Office expects that an additional $7 billion in sales revenue each year will be returned to the Australian tax base because of these reforms. The actions already taken by the government show its firm belief that while taxes should be low, they must also be paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill continues to deliver on the goal by further cracking down on multinational tax avoidance while, at the same time, providing tax relief for both innovative venture capital investors and Australian Defence Force personnel who receive reparations. For instance, schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to exempt payments made as reparation to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. This will ensure that payments that are made as reparations to these victims will be exempt from income tax. The government previously made similar payments to victims of abuse in the ADF through the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce. The task force administered reparation payments of up to $50,000 to complainants who likely suffered sexual or other abuse by a member of Defence. These payments were specifically exempted from income tax because there was a possibility that the payments could be seen as arising from employment with Defence and understood, were it not for this legislation, to be income in the hands of the recipient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The task force concluded on 31 August 2016. However, this bill will ensure that the important work it carried out is continued by expanding the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to include the ability to make recommendations for reparation payments, which the government has already provided some $19.5 million to deal with. From now on, these reparation payments will be made on the recommendation of the Defence Force Ombudsman and will be exempt from income tax. This is because the government believes that the recipient of a payment of this kind should receive the full benefit of it, particularly the men and women who so honourably serve and protect our country in our Australian defence forces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the government is committed to encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship through the Australian economy. Key to this is fostering competition. We know that greater competition leads to greater innovation, and that's what grows economies and creates jobs and wealth for their citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Australia has a sophisticated financial sector underpinned by a strong regulatory system, our financial services are at risk of becoming uncompetitive if they fail to keep pace with technological disruption and the global change in this field. That's why the government has already introduced new tax incentives for early-stage venture capital investors in relation to investments in financial technology, as a part of the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda. This is an important step in ensuring the competitiveness of the fintech sector, as venture capital is a vital mechanism for financing new innovative enterprises at the start-up and early expansion stages of their commercialisation. Venture capitalists invest funds in such enterprises in return for an equity share or the equivalent of partial ownership. The funds provided to the enterprise are used to develop their ideas in the early stages of development and ensure early-stage commercial viability. These tax concessions support high-risk fintech businesses at the start-up and early expansion stages where it would otherwise be difficult to attract investment using normal commercial means.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fintech sector is a largely new industry composed of companies that use technology to make financial services more efficient. These innovators are harnessing technology to deliver services in more relevant and convenient ways to Australian businesses and consumers. In a recent study, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fintech in Australia—trends, forecasts and analysis 2015–2020</span>, research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan says the Australian fintech sector is poised to contribute $3 billion of new revenue to the Australian financial services sector by 2020, while it is also estimated that fintech investment reached US$20 billion in 2015. It's clear that developing our fintech industry here will not only drive expansion and growth in our financial exports but will also deliver benefits to Australians through new services that will create value or bring efficiencies and convenience to the market. Indeed, with our financial services sector being the largest contributor to the financial economy, advancements in research and development represent a crucial opportunity for innovation in a key services sector of our growing economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, current uncertainties about tax concessions have restricted the access of the fintech sector to venture capital investment, which could potentially create stagnation if it's not dealt with in this vital sector of the economy. So schedule 3 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that the venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fintech businesses. This clarification means that early-stage venture capital partnerships can receive tax concessions when they invest in new fintech businesses that are developing new technology, including using technology that might already exist but in a new and novel way. The removal of ambiguity from the tax law will help to foster a culture of entrepreneurship and encourage the necessary early-stage risk-taking while improving access to capital for Australian business to ensure that they grow and succeed. Innovation and Science Australia will be enabled to make public and private findings on the eligibility of investments, while banks that split their obligations in order to receive the benefits of the tax concessions, should they choose to take that path, will be excluded under anti-avoidance rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor is promising a $200 billion tax increase across the Australian economy, the government is creating an environment to make Australia's fintech sector more internationally competitive through lower taxes. While we want lower taxes, as I said before, we're also serious about compliance. If taxes are due, they have to be paid, and that's why we're committed to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax. The OECD has estimated that, globally, between US$100 billion and US$240 billion of corporate tax revenue is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some multinationals artificially structure their company to avoid Australian tax by booking revenue from Australian sales offshore. When that happens, they have an unfair advantage as against local businesses, families and small businesses, who have no choice about where they pay their tax and are inevitably left to shoulder more of the tax burden when those who are multinationals don't bear their share. Our already implemented multinational anti-avoidance laws allow the Commissioner of Taxation to treat the multinationals as though they have a taxable presence in Australia and were subject to Australian tax on their Australian income. As a result, 38 multinational corporations have changed or are in the process of changing their tax affairs to bring their Australian-sourced sales back onshore, including businesses like Google and Facebook.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the Australian Taxation Office has identified that certain partnership arrangements have been designed to avoid these laws. The bill will ensure that the original laws operate as intended. For example, schedule 1 of the bill toughens our multinational anti-avoidance laws by ensuring corporate structures involving foreign trusts and partnerships are subject to the law. This measure involves a technical amendment to prevent large multinationals from avoiding the application of the anti-avoidance laws by interposing partnerships that have foreign resident partners, trusts that have foreign resident trustees or beneficiaries, or foreign trusts that temporarily have their central management and control in Australia. This will continue to ensure fairness in this sector. Importantly, this measure will not negatively impact on investment by multinationals in Australia, as the measure is targeted towards those that attempt to avoid being subject to anti-avoidance laws by manipulating a certain target structure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the government believe in and are committed to supporting small and family business. That's why we have consistently delivered support to small businesses through the life of this government. Whether that's initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off or company tax reductions for small and medium-sized businesses—which I believe the Labor Party have a policy to take away if they're successful at the next election—this government stands side by side with small businesses every day of the week. I'm glad to see that Prime Minister Scott Morrison has dedicated a minister for small and family business to his cabinet table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses can also attract capital gains tax concessions to assist owners by providing relief from capital gains tax when they dispose of assets related to their business. This helps them to reinvest, to grow, to employ more Australians and to contribute to their own retirement savings. However, it is important to the integrity of our tax system that these capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted. We want to ensure that the concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small and family businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately some taxpayers are currently able to access the small business capital gains concessions for assets that are unrelated to their small business. For example, it's possible to arrange one's affairs so that ownership interests in larger businesses don't count towards the tests for determining eligibility for the concession. So schedule 2 of the bill tries to deal with that, improving the integrity of these concessions. The concessions themselves aren't changing, and they'll continue to be available to genuine small business taxpayers. The proposed amendments will mean the small business capital gains tax concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets that are used in a small business or for ownership interests in a small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key features of this new law will include a limitation on the size of the company or trust being disposed of to ensure that it is genuinely a small business in the Australian market, and clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interest in the company or trust. This ensures taxpayers don't benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote. It will involve modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares in companies or interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities. This prevents concessions from being available where most of the value of the company or trust is in fact unrelated to small business activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is just another example of how the Liberal-National government is taking action in a space where Labor failed to do so. While those on the other side love to talk about multinational corporations and tax integrity, it's been the Liberal-National government who has taken action to tackle multinational tax avoidance every day of the week. In doing so, it enables us to lower taxes for all Australians. I support this bill because it will ensure a more effective and targeted tax system while continuing our agenda of providing tax relief, equipping us to reduce more taxes for more Australians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. It is, indeed, an honour and a privilege to be able to speak on yet another treasury laws amendment bill that has been introduced in this place, for this is an area in which the Morrison coalition government and both the Turnbull and Abbott governments before have given considerable thought and have taken action that has actually made a considerable difference to the budget bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I begin my remarks, I'd like to acknowledge the good work of the Commissioner of Taxation, Chris Jordan, who has, within nearly five years in the role, made a significant impact on the ATO, on its operations, on its personnel and also, particularly, on its approach to collecting tax revenue on behalf of the government. You would know, Acting Deputy President Marshall, that the Liberal-National coalition will always be a government of lower taxes. The Liberal Party in particular prides themselves on being a party that values lower taxes and that wants to keep more of what you earn in your pockets. But, at the same time, we are committed to ensuring that those who do earn income in Australia pay their fair share of tax in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Chris Jordan is equally committed to that cause. He is certainly a man that does not take tax avoidance or tax evasion lightly. In fact, at the last Senate estimates he revealed that, particularly in the area of multinational tax avoidance, the new measures that this government have taken, whether it be through the diverted profits tax or the multinational anti-avoidance legislation, have already netted around $5 billion in additional revenue to the ATO and therefore to the budget bottom line. In fact, the ATO said that about 70 companies were being looked at very closely under that multinational anti-avoidance legislation because they were deemed to have a medium to high risk of avoiding a taxable presence in Australia and that 25 companies—I think this was nearly a year ago—had already started to restructure to fall in line with the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. That was because of the tough stance that Commissioner Jordan and the ATO had taken, backed by the federal government's multinational anti-avoidance law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Microsoft, for example, had previously booked revenue for many of its sales in Australia in low-tax Singapore. But about 12 or so months ago it reached a settlement with the ATO under which it would book a much higher proportion of sales and therefore tax in Australia. Mr Jordan had said that this crackdown on foreign multinationals had very quickly achieved the desired results. As I said, in the 16 months until the end of October—and that was last year—it had flushed out retrospective tax liabilities of more than $5 billion from a swag of global giants operating in Australia. Nearly $1 billion of that was raised in four months alone. Of course, this came ahead of the imminent launches of companies like the retail giant Amazon in Australia, which would have walked into the Australian market with a completely different understanding of its obligations to pay tax in this country than if it had come into the market only 12 or 18 months beforehand. Google is another one of the companies that is targeted. In fact, the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and the diverted profits tax were dubbed the 'Google tax'. Facebook, of course, is the other one. It was particularly targeting those very large and quite opaque international companies. In fact, Mr Jordan said that they had an 'intellectual might' associated with them. And prior to this particular piece of legislation, those companies had attempted to intimidate the ATO to some extent to give them lower tax assessments. Mr Jordan noted that some of those multinationals attempted to bamboozle him and bamboozle ATO officials with financial fairytales and they tried to intellectually browbeat the ATO with great big piles of reports and spaghetti diagrams on white boards saying things like, 'Look, we have the greatest experts in the world.'</span>

                    </a>  Yes, the dreaded whiteboards, Senator Cameron. The world's greatest experts would say, 'This particular tax structure works. Who are you at the ATO to challenge us?' So Mr Jordan, applying these new multinational anti-avoidance laws and also the diverted profits tax, made sure his officials weren't boxed into a corner by the technical analysis and the intellectual might and legal and financial power of these very large companies. He has done so particularly successfully because he is as committed as the coalition to these companies paying the right amount of tax on profits that are earned in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this particular legislation toughens those Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law that has been so successful over the term of this government. The first schedule of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to improve the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, the MAAL. Currently large multinationals can avoid the operation of that Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law by putting certain kinds of partnerships and trusts between the global entity and the consumer. The kinds of partnerships that are used are those that have foreign resident partners or foreign resident trustees or beneficiaries or are foreign resident trusts that can temporarily have central management and control in Australia. You can see how complicated those sorts of spaghetti diagrams on a whiteboard would be, which is why it's so important to dethatch the complexities of the tax arrangements of these companies. The use of these sorts of structures contravenes the original policy intent of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, so this particular bill that we have before us in the chamber today ensures that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law acts as it was originally intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You may recall that the original anti-avoidance laws were enacted in December 2017 to prevent those very large multinationals from avoiding the tax on their Australian business profits by artificially structuring their affairs in a way that results in them not having to have that taxable presence in Australia. As I said earlier, since that legislation was enacted on January 12016, it has been highly effective and highly beneficial. It has achieved a significant intake of tax to the ATO and therefore to the budget bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 15 December 2016, the ATO published its concerns with certain restructures involving those foreign partnerships undertaken in response to the implementation of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation, so this was like a post-implementation review. It was entirely appropriate that the ATO, which implements this particular piece of legislation, should review its efficacy. And while the ATO said it is highly effective and will achieve its objectives, it does have some tweaking where there potentially are loopholes remaining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular bill affects the large multinationals that fall within the scope of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. In general those entities have a global income of more than $1 billion, so we're certainly not dealing with the small end of town here. As to the date of effect, the schedule will apply from 1 January 2016, which of courses is the original date of the effect of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. There has been public consultation—a public consultation paper was released on 12 February 2018—and the Treasurer received a number of submissions from groups as diverse as Deloitte, the Tax Justice Network and the Australian Retailers Association. There was a general consensus of support for the proposed amendments to this bill, and Deloitte in fact also provided some minor technical amendments to the exposure draft legislation. The financial impact of this is estimated to be unquantifiable, but it will result in a gain to revenue over the period 2017-18 to 2020-21.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 is about improving the integrity of the small-business capital gains tax concessions. It gives effect to the 2017-18 budget announcement that the government would amend the small-business capital gains tax concessions to ensure that they could only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business so that the capital gains tax concessions that are available are only used and accessed appropriately. The object of those small-business capital gains tax concessions is to provide relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of assets related to a small business. Currently the problem, of course, is that some taxpayers are able to access those concessions for assets which are entirely unrelated to their small business. For example, they can arrange their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the tests for determining eligibility for these concessions. As of 1 July last year, additional basic conditions have to be satisfied to ensure that small-business capital gains tax concessions are only available to genuine small businesses. This includes testing the size of the company or the trust that is being disposed of to raise that capital gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendments tighten the eligibility criteria for the small-business capital gains tax concessions and ensure that they are better targeted to those to whom it is relevant. The concessions themselves, it should be noted, are not changing; they will continue to be available to genuine small-business taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets of less than $6 million. The intention here is that the measure will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2017, and the application is consistent with the budget announcement on 9 May 2017 about ensuring that those concessions can only be accessed in relation to the assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. As you can see, this is little more than an integrity measure to shore up measures that have already been put into place. There was public consultation on this particular legislation as well. The accompanying explanatory material was circulated in February this year, and feedback from the consultation has been incorporated into the final drafting of the bill. While it's hard to quantify the financial gain that will inevitably come from this particular measure, again, it will be over the forward estimates period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a further schedule around fin-tech and venture capital amendments—schedule 3. This is a particularly important amendment for my home state of Victoria, where the fin-tech industry is booming. Schedule 3 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to clarify that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships, also known as ESVCLPs—rather a mouthful—and venture capital limited partnerships, VCLPs, can make investments in fin-tech firms. This will ensure that fin-tech businesses have better access to the capital that they need to grow and succeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of a suite of financing alternatives that the coalition government, the National-Liberal Morrison coalition government, have been putting together for some time. You will recall that last week we discussed crowdsourced funding arrangements. Not that long ago, we established the ASIC sandbox to allow fintechs to operate temporarily without a full financial licence to see whether their businesses are viable. This is all part of the suite of laws that allow fintechs the best chance of getting established, growing and thriving in this country. It is a new industry and a very exciting industry that's growing not just in Australia but worldwide. It's very important that we compete for the best and brightest minds in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is clearly committed to encouraging innovation throughout the Australian economy. To this end the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda, NISA, was announced, you will recall, in December 2015. It included enhanced tax concessions for these early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also for venture capital limited partnerships. These particular programs encourage venture capital investment in Australian start-ups, providing these businesses with the funds that they need to grow and to prosper. This particular schedule will clarify that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also venture capital limited partnerships can invest in fintech businesses that are developing the new technology, including using technology in a novel way, such as through developing new products and services, by removing the ambiguity from the tax law and also providing certainty for venture capital investors. The amendments outlined in schedule 3 will impact both investors and participants in early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also venture capital limited partnerships regimes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are supported by stakeholders and will provide particular benefit to venture capital investors in fintech businesses, providing certainty that they can invest in fintech, and it will also benefit the fintech businesses themselves as they will have better access to improved venture capital funding as a result of these changes. The fintech amendment was announced as part of the Treasurer's fintech statement, which was released in March 2016. The Treasury conducted an initial public consultation into this particular bill, on the amendments in schedule 3, and received a number of responses from key stakeholders, including the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, some law firms, some accounting firms and Innovation and Science Australia. The consultation process started in October last year and concluded in November. Following that particular consultation process, the Treasury worked with the stakeholders, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Innovation and Science Australia, AusIndustry and the ATO to refine the current bill to reflect a number of the suggestions made by stakeholders. I should mention that those stakeholders were broadly very supportive of the changes that were being made to fintechs. The financial impact of these changes is hard to quantify, but it's all about having the right policy settings to allow these particular firms, fintech firms—this growing industry—to grow, thrive and prosper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another schedule to this particular legislation, schedule 4, which is about tax exemptions for payments made under the Defence Force Ombudsman scheme. This is to exempt from income tax payments the reparations to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. That is very important. The government previously made similar payments to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force through the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce. The taskforce administered reparation payments of up to $50,000 through the Defence Abuse Reparation Scheme to complainants who likely suffered sexual and other abuse by a member of Defence. These payments were specifically exempted from income tax as there was a possibility that the payment could be seen to arise from employment with Defence and considered income in the hands of the recipient. The task force concluded on 31 August 2016 and assessed any abuse that occurred prior to 11 April 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget this year the government announced that it would continue the existing functions of the Defence Force Ombudsman and expand its role to include the ability to make recommendations for reparation payments. The government announced that it would provide $19.5 million over four years from 2017-18 for the reparation payments. The previous functions that were undertaken by the task force and the scheme are effectively being replicated and will now be executed by the Defence Force Ombudsman. It affects only the victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force who receive reparation payments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZE" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I want to very much thank senators for their contributions and for their support for what is a very, very important bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, as I think was so eloquently outlined by Senator Hume and others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through a couple of the key elements of the bill before summing up. Schedule 1 of the bill strengthens the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and ensures that it operates as intended. This amendment will further deliver on what has been a very tough stance from this Liberal-National government against multinational tax avoidance, as demonstrated by the successive measures implemented in recent years to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the opposition, the Labor Party, who have talked a big game in opposition on multinational tax avoidance, this is something that we deliver on in government. We deliver on it as a principled position for a number of reasons. We deliver on it because, by having everyone pay their fair share, by ensuring that large multinationals can't profit-shift offshore, by having them pay their fair share, Australian taxpayers—the hardworking men and women who are working hard every day and paying a lot of income tax or those who are building up their small and medium enterprises and paying their fair share of tax—can rely on services to be delivered by the Australian government. The way that we can do that, while growing the economy and putting the budget back into balance, is to have everyone pay their fair share. So, as a matter of principle, we have a stance that says multinationals must pay their fair share. Schedule 1, by strengthening the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, ensures that we get fairness in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the budget measures we have undertaken and the approach that the coalition has taken to economic policy, you see that these are always built on those pillars. We do everything we can to grow the economy. We grow the economy by lowering taxes, whether that's by getting rid of things like the mining tax and the carbon tax, whether that's by lowering people's electricity bills, whether that is by lowering income tax for hardworking taxpayers, whether that's by lowering taxes for small business so they can grow their business and employ more Australians, or whether that's by getting rid of red tape—as we have done every year since we came into government. All of that has helped Australians who are having a go to do better and has helped our economy to thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put in place measures, such as our free trade agreements, which deliver more economic activity and more jobs into the Australian economy and help get spending under control. We have shown in every budget, successive budgets, that, by limiting the growth of spending, we will be able to get the budget back into balance next year—all the while cutting taxes for small business; all the while cutting taxes for low- and middle-income earners; and all the while being able to deliver record investment in really important areas such as defence, health, education, infrastructure and a range of other very important areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been our economic approach, and getting multinationals to pay their fair share is part of those integrity measures. We've had integrity measures in other parts of the system. We've moved a record number of people from welfare into work. We've had those people who have been rorting the welfare system taken off the welfare system so that those who need it because they're doing it tough for various reasons have access to it and so we can deliver on things like the NDIS. This has been at the heart of what we've done. We don't just talk about it; we get it done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to give effect to the government's 2017-18 budget announcement. It will improve integrity and better target the small-business capital gains tax concessions. Again, making sure there's integrity in the system ensures that we can continue to deliver tax relief for small businesses, as opposed to the Labor Party who wants to up taxes for small and medium enterprises. It allows us to deliver that income tax relief and it allows us to deliver the services that Australians expect and Australians want their government to be able to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are designed to ensure that the concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. Why is this important? It's because the amendments introduce a test on the size of the business being disposed of to prevent inappropriate access to the concessions for assets unrelated to a small business, so it brings them in. This ensures that these important concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—and that's hardworking small businesses. Any number of measures that we put in place to support small business is because we know that these are hardworking Australians and these are hardworking men and women who put their capital on the line, who often put their house on the line, who often work 50-, 60- or 70-hour weeks, and who often have a family business where everyone contributes. At every turn, the Liberal-National government seeks to make things a little bit easier for those hardworking men and women. It says to them, 'We'll lower your tax burden, we'll lower the amount of red tape, we'll work hard to lower your energy bills, we'll build a framework of a strong economy through free trade and other things, and we'll control our own spending so that you're not burdened with excessive taxes down the track and so we can deliver the infrastructure and the services that are necessary for you to thrive.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology, or fintech, hub. This is a major area of potential growth. Schedule 3 of this bill builds on this work. It builds on the work of our government to ensure that we have the right policy settings in place to foster innovation. This has been a key focus of our government, and one of the reasons it's a key focus of our government is because we know that Australians have some of the best examples of innovation, invention, and research and development in the world. But, because of some of the challenges in getting capital, we haven't always been able to fully exploit and build on those great innovations and that great entrepreneurship that exists and is in the DNA of the Australian people. We see it as a partnership and a way of assisting businesses and entrepreneurs who come up with those amazing ideas to then be able to get the capital that they need so that they can then employ people, grow their businesses, have profitable businesses, reinvest in those businesses, employ more people, grow our economy and provide the opportunities that we want to see for Australian men and women as they come into the workforce and as they stay in the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3, to that end, amends the early-stage venture capital limited partnership, the venture capital limited partnership and tax incentives for early-stage investor regimes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. What this does is it clarifies that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses, removes ambiguity from the tax law and provides certainty for venture capital investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, we've got extraordinary entrepreneurs. If you go to our universities and many of our small businesses, and if you meet our scientists who are coming up with the research and development, the ideas and the great technological breakthroughs, we invest so much. We've got a great record as a government in things like the Medical Research Future Fund. That is one area of extraordinary innovation that will see jobs grow and, just as importantly, will save lives. It will see Australians living longer and living healthier lives through medical research. We think there is a major economic advantage in that as well as people live longer lives and as we develop these products and sell them to the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got these extraordinary scientists and innovators, and we want to bring more capital behind them so that they can indeed have the opportunity to develop those products. Instead of people having to go offshore in order to fully develop their ideas and their products, as has unfortunately happened in many cases in the past, we want them developing here. We're seeing more of that. We're seeing that with collaborations in partnerships between our research organisations and our universities. We do it with things like CRCs. One of the innovations we have brought in is the CRCPs, which is a great addition to the cooperative research centres. The cooperative research centres are a way of bringing all those entities together. It is world-leading. The CRCPs are shorter-term and more focused. The industry response—I had responsibility in that area—has been very positive. We're able to do things again in a slightly quicker and a more innovative way, and do some of those shorter-term smaller projects which can still have absolutely substantial benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this will clarify those early stage venture capital limited partnerships—and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses—and it remove ambiguity from the tax law. That is important for attracting that investment. We want to see that investment continuing to come from Australian investors and also from foreign investors in some of our great ideas and backing our entrepreneurs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This again demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and risk-taking in Australia, and it will help ensure that innovative Australian businesses have access to the capital and expertise that they need to grow and succeed. It works hand in hand with those other aspects of policy that I have outlined. When you allow capital to come in, when you encourage entrepreneurship, when you have those industry partnerships, when you lower taxes for small and medium businesses, when you allow free trade to thrive and when you cut red tape and encourage Australians to get ahead and employ more people, then these things come together in a very positive way—as we are seeing with the record number of jobs that we have created. We very much believe in this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the 2017-18 budget, the government announced, on another aspect of this bill, that it would expand the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to make recommendations for reparation payments. All complains of abuse in Defence made to the Defence Force Ombudsman will now include an assessment for a reparation payment. Previously, similar reparation payments were administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. The reparation payments made by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were specifically exempt from income tax. This is an important change, and it builds on some of this good work. It's another way of honouring the amazing work that our Defence Force personnel do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed not just to the defence of our nation but to the health and welfare of our Defence personnel. I think we have learnt a lot in recent years about where we have let them down from time to time as a nation. We have learnt where we can do better. We always strive to make sure that we look after the welfare of those men and women who put their lives on the line for the sake of our nation and our freedom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, schedule 4 of this bill responds to the government's expansion of the existing functions of the Defence Force Ombudsman. Similar reparation payments were previously administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. Reparation payments made by the task force, as I said, were specifically exempt from income tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 ensures that the new reparation payments recommended by the Defence Force Ombudsman are exempt from income tax. Reparation payments are not intended to be compensation, and complainants will not be required to release the Commonwealth from liability. These amendments ensure the recipients get the full benefit of such a payment free from the obligation to pay income tax. For all of these reasons, all of those schedules come together for some important reforms. I've outlined a number of the reasons. They build on a number of earlier reforms that the Liberal-National government have been proud to deliver, and I look forward to the hopeful passage of this bill thorough the Senate. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment changes the start date for the small business capital gains tax concession measure in schedule 2. Labor flagged our position on this issue during debate on this bill in the other place. Stakeholders have informed Labor that the additional conditions for eligibility for the concessions are detailed in a way that makes the changes more akin to a policy change rather than an integrity change and captures taxpayers who engage in good faith, according to the intent of the concessions. These changes only came to light when the detailed amendments were released in the exposure draft bill on 8 February 2018. Accordingly, Labor's amendment would change the implementation date from 1 July 2017, as per the budget announcement, to 8 February 2018. That is the date of the exposure draft release. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that this bill could have probably been dealt with and passed an hour ago. We know exactly what's happening here. This is a government with no agenda. This is a government that really have got no legislative agenda of any substance before the Senate. They are in a situation where they are too busy continuing to knife each other, attacking each other, moving from one Prime Minister to another to actually deal with the issues of importance to the Australian people. That's why we had these filibusters take place, where backbench senators stand up and try to talk out 20 minutes on a bill that could have been dealt with in a short period of time. I understand there's no controversy, that we've got agreement on the amendments—there's agreement on this amendment. We should actually get on with the business of this Senate. The problem is that if we do get through the business of the Senate, we will probably run out of legislation. This rabble of a government—their own Prime Minister describes them as 'muppets'—can't get their act together. We had Senator Stoker stand up and tell us about how great things are under a Liberal government. We had Senator Seselja just stand up and tell us how great things are going under this coalition government—they are going swimmingly, aren't they? Things are going swimmingly, going so well under the coalition. What an absolute joke, what an absolute rabble of a government you lot are. </span>

Integrity was so important back in the 2014-15 budget that they actually cut $120 million out of ASIC. That's how much they cared about integrity—$120 million out of ASIC. The Hon.

Maybe that explains why current Prime Minister Morrison actually voted against the royal commission into the banks on 26 occasions. Maybe he wanted the banks to have more self-regulation. Maybe he thought the banks could look after regulation better than the government. Well, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government that we've got now, they probably could.

He's claiming a filibuster, and he spent seven or eight minutes going on about what he didn't like about the 2014 budget and quoting the parliamentary secretary at the time, Steven Ciobo, rather than dealing with the bill. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cameron claims the economy's not going well. That's absolute rubbish. Senator Cameron didn't like Senator Stoker's contribution—or Senator Hume's outstanding contribution—because he wouldn't want the opportunity to put on the record why this kind of legislation is important and how it builds on the Liberal-National government's agenda and achievements of delivering over one million jobs for our economy. Those one million jobs came despite the Labor Party's opposition. Every major measure we took, you were there to oppose it. When we got rid of the carbon tax and when we got rid of the mining tax, you were there to oppose it. When we were cutting back taxes for small and medium enterprises, you were there to oppose it. When we were dealing with union corruption, which holds our economy back, Senator Cameron and the Labor Party were there to oppose it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cameron gets up and gives us a lecture. He takes several minutes—in fact eight or nine minutes—on an amendment to give us a lecture about filibustering, and then he claims that those economic credentials and those achievements aren't real. They are real. They haven't come about by accident. They've come about through sound economic policy, through the right legislation and through the right settings. They've come about despite the Labor Party. As we have fixed your economic mess and as we've fixed your budget mess, at every turn you have opposed us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will make no apology for talking about our legislative agenda, which is about tax integrity. We have delivered when it comes to multinationals, when you did nothing. What did the Labor Party do on multinationals when they were in government? Absolutely nothing. We had Senator Dastyari come in opposition and talk about what he wanted to do, which they did nothing about when they were in government. They had six years and they didn't get it done. The economy absolutely stagnated. We have taken a different approach, and that has delivered over one million jobs, lower taxes, and services we need for Australians. We've secured our borders. We've built up our defence industry. We are delivering a balanced budget. Those are things the Labor Party could only dream of when they were in government. We're not going to be lectured to by Senator Cameron on this or anything else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now turn to Senator Cameron's and the opposition's amendment. The government announced, in the 2017-18 budget, an integrity measure to ensure that the small business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted to genuine small businesses with effect from 1 July 2017. The opposition's amendment would defer the start of this measure to 8 February 2018. Delaying the start would allow a further period of time in which to transition into the new arrangements. We believe this is an important integrity measure. The government needs to balance any request for a delayed start against the risk of providing more scope for entities to inappropriately access the small business CGT concessions. Notwithstanding these concerns, the government is willing to support the amendment proposed by the opposition to delay the start to 8 February to 18. The small business CGT concessions are not changing. These concessions provide valuable relief from taxation for small business owners on capital gains on the disposal of assets related to their business, allowing them to reinvest and grow as well as contribute to their retirement savings. Passing this bill will ensure small business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted so they can continue to benefit those that need it the most—hardworking Australian small businesses.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I want to briefly touch on the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee in <span style="font-style:italic;">Report No. 11 of 2018</span> that the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Police Powers at Airports) Bill 2018 not be referred to a committee. What we will get here—I'll make a confident prediction—is that this will end up with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which, as we all know, is a closed shop between the two establishment parties in this place. I'll also confidently predict that the committee will ultimately recommend supporting this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people and all senators should understand that this bill contains highly coercive powers. It is proposing that Australian Federal Police officers be able to wander up to any person at a designated airport in Australia and say to them, 'Papers, please.' We've seen, historically, what happens when societies go down this route. This is a dangerous piece of legislation. If it's enacted through this parliament, it will join the over 200 pieces of legislation in the last 20 years that have removed fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in this country. It will be a continuation of the slow shuffle of the major establishment parties, leading this country down the road towards an authoritarian police state. Again, this bill deserves to be examined and should have been recommended for examination by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. It should have been subject to significant public hearings and it should have been able to be inquired into through a committee that is transparent and a committee that has a fine record of doing its job with regard to assessing legislation. Instead, it has been referred to a committee that is a closed shop, that no member of the crossbench of this Senate, whether it be Greens senators, Centre Alliance senators or any other senators on the crossbench, has the opportunity to participate in. Once again, we see the closed shop that occurs in the PJCIS that I confidently predict will occur this time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe it's likely that the committee will recommend rasping off a few of the roughest edges of this legislation, because that's often what happens on similar bills, but we will be presented—once again, I confidently predict—with a recommendation to pass the bill. It will pass with the combined LNP-ALP votes through both houses of the parliament, based on a PJCIS recommendation, and it will again remove fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties that many people on the government side of this chamber like to claim they believe in and support, but they can't get together quick enough in the PJCIS to erode those fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties, for which we used to send Australians overseas to fight and die in order to protect and enhance.</span>

Just to remind the chamber what this is about, this is about enabling the apology to survivors of institutionalised child sexual abuse. It's really important. It's only for a relatively short time, for an hour and 15 minutes. I would encourage those senators that can stay longer to stay longer, because survivors are very keen to make sure that people get a chance to talk to them and to mingle and to take part in the activities that are going on around the apology. I encourage senators to fully engage in that apology on 22 October.</span>

To ensure time is maximised, it is proposed that committees meet up until the time of the proposed suspension, with no morning tea break. Where necessary, the government will work with committees to facilitate spillover hearings, ensuring ministerial availability where possible, to make up for any lost time. And committees should accommodate any reasonable requests from deputy chairs around extending hours to compensate for the interruption, including but not necessarily limited to: commencing earlier, curtailing lunch or dinner breaks, or concluding later.</span>

                  </a>  The Nobel Peace Prize is a singular honour. The Australian government shares with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. However, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons risks undermining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of Nuclear Weapons by creating competing obligations. It has nonproliferation safeguard standards weaker than those established under the NPT, and it is vague or silent on verification and enforcement. Australia strongly supports more practical measures for nuclear disarmament, including a fissile material cut-off treaty, the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and further developing verification processes.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens absolutely welcome the Nobel Peace Ride riders to Canberra. I look forward to meeting with them hopefully later today. The former Prime Minister of the country may not have had the good grace to congratulate them on this remarkable achievement, but let me say on behalf of the Australian Greens: a huge congratulations to ICAN, a small group of committed activists based in Melbourne who came together and achieved remarkable things. Thank you for all of your hard work. Thank you to those people right across civil society who are working to rid the world once and for all of nuclear weapons. Of course, the best way to say thank you to those people is to unequivocally support Australia signing and ratifying the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty. After all, the whole point of the ride is for this place to support that treaty. We support you in your endeavours, and we urge the government and the Labor Party to do the same.</span>

This is the worst form of racism. They are outraged over the persecution of the Rohingya people and Muslims but not of the Christian farmers or the Jewish Israelis. It is a disgrace.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. I'll try and do it in one minute if I can. First to Senator Anning: he may or may not have actually read the motion, but there was a detailed United Nations fact-finding mission report which detailed some serious violations of human rights, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</span>

                  </a>  If I may, Senator Anning, I didn't interject on you on this serious issue. It does reflect the seriousness of that report that the two parties of government have co-sponsored a foreign policy motion. It would be a good statement about the bipartisan view as to the need to respond to the serious war crimes and serious violations of human rights which have been documented in the UN report. It is not very often that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the shadow minister for foreign affairs co-sponsor a motion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Anning, I appreciate you have different views about different areas where the Senate should deal with these issues. We have previously placed on record, consistent with the position that has been in place for some time, that foreign policy questions that are complex and contested—and many of the ones to which you refer have been contested—given the nature of this part of the program where one cannot amend and there is not substantive debate, are not an appropriate vehicle for formal business. If you wish to deny formality for the reasons you've outlined, I think, frankly, that reflects upon you, Senator Anning.</span>

We welcome the fact we are having a substantial debate on a foreign policy motion. We are very supportive and have always felt this is the appropriate chamber to express such sentiments. There is no question that what has gone on in Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine, Shan and Kachin states, have been some of the gravest atrocities ever witnessed. We have known this for some time. We are very pleased that finally we are seeing the government consider—and we hope very soon adopt—very strict sanctions against that regime. We would also like to see the government go further. It should immediately suspend military cooperation with Myanmar, just as the UK, EU and US have done. We would support a referral to the International Criminal Court of Justice.</span>

                  </a>  First up, I want to acknowledge Garry Kerr from Farmer Power and Shaughn Morgan from Dairy Connect, who have advocated strongly on behalf of dairy farmers and made sure we in the parliament are aware of all the issues facing regional Australia. I also want to note that, while it won't solve the wider structural issues facing the dairy industry, Woolworths today announced they'll be adding 10c a litre to the price of milk to be directed straight to drought-affected farmers. It is, I believe, a testament to our community that many shoppers around the country—city and country—are happy to cop that small extra charge to help those people who work hard every day to keep the milk industry alive in Australia. Farmers I have spoken to have told me that every cent helps during these difficult times.</span>

                  </a>  Labor strongly supports this motion. The ACCC recommended the establishment of a mandatory code of conduct for the dairy industry in April this year. Sadly, the Turnbull-Morrison government has chosen not to prioritise the recommendation and has essentially abandoned the dairy industry. Labor supports the establishment of the mandatory code of conduct for the dairy industry and condemns the chaotic and dysfunctional Turnbull-Morrison government for not prioritising the implementation of the code.</span>

                  </a>  One Nation will be supporting this. But I find it quite ironic that it was only Thursday of last week that I moved a motion on the floor of this parliament with regard to the dairy industry, and it was not supported by the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Labor Party or some of the crossbenchers. The Greens did support me on that motion last week, which was pretty much in line with what's put here today. So what's happened over this last week? I'm glad that Senator Hinch, who voted against my motion last week, has now moved this motion on the dairy industry.</span>

It is absolutely unacceptable that on current figures, by the time we get to 2030, 12,000 Australians could be killed and 360,000 injured, at a cost of possibly more than $300 billion. I'm looking forward to a response from the government and Minister McCormack. Minister McCormack's response to the announcement of the report was that he was looking to work in a bipartisan relationship with Labor. We will certainly be doing everything we can to absolutely put a stop to this terrible— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The government acknowledges the importance of the issue of improving road safety raised by the senators. It is a matter that we believe is important to all members of this parliament. The government commissioned an independent inquiry into the effectiveness of the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020, which was released at an event attended by the government and opposition members as well as key road safety stakeholders. The government commends the work of the inquiry panel, and we will work with all stakeholders to deliver better road safety outcomes for all Australians. As the Deputy Prime Minister has said, one road death or accident is one too many.</span>

In particular we note the significance of the need to be acting on road safety for the safety of cyclists, noting that cyclists comprise three per cent of all road fatalities and 15 per cent of all road hospitalisations. We look forward to the implementation of this road safety strategy so that we can reduce the number of deaths overall on our roads, particularly making cycling safer for all Australians.</span>

Australian citizens who commit crimes including terrorist offences are subject to criminal prosecution.

                  </a>  Rhinos are in crisis. There are just 67 Javan rhinos, less than 80 Sumatran rhinos and less than 6,000 black rhinos left. We humans have a lot to answer for. The Greens are proud of our role in combating the illegal ivory trade and of being a loud voice for animals across Australian parliaments. Seventy-seven per cent of Australians believe that trading elephant ivory and rhino horn is already illegal in Australia, so it is really disappointing that our laws lag behind community expectations. The ivory trade is not the only threat facing rhinoceros populations. This parliament needs to take urgent action on climate change and support other countries to protect these critically endangered animals.</span>

                  </a>  The government has made a number of changes to improve the flexibility and equity of the superannuation system. This helps individuals with interrupted work patterns, including women, to save for their retirement. But, under current arrangements, fees and insurance premiums can eat up a significant proportion of additional contributions. That is why the government's key priority is passage of the Protecting Your Super Package announced in the 2018-19 budget. This will protect superannuation balances from undue erosion, which will enable individuals to make the most of their superannuation savings. Those opposite must support this bill to ensure that the retirement savings of all Australians, but particularly women, are protected.</span>

                  </a>  It is very disappointing that the Greens have refused to give leave to support this amendment today. Unlike the Greens, who are more interested in stunts and posturing, the Labor Party is serious about securing the financial future of Australian women and has announced plans to deliver on this. We know that women retire on about $113,000 less than their male counterparts and something needs to be done. The Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has failed when it comes to superannuation. It has delayed increases to the superannuation guarantee and has planned to abolish the low-income superannuation contribution. In stark contrast, Labor, under Bill Shorten's leadership, has announced that in government we would invest $400 million to strengthen Australia's superannuation system and boost women's superannuation balances. It's unfortunate that the Greens and Senator Waters, who moved this motion, would not allow this amendment to be voted on today and instead have denied leave. All the Greens care about are stunts, while the Labor party is interested in delivering on policies that help Australians.</span>

                    </a>  Labor has repeatedly called for the Liberal-National government to release the latest data on the home care package waitlist, which is now weeks late. Disappointingly, the minister for aged care delayed the last set of data, March 2018, by more than three months. What is the government trying to hide? The delayed 2018 quarter of data on the home care package waitlist revealed more than 108,000 older Australians are waiting for care. This includes around 88,000 older Australians waiting with high needs, many with dementia. This is now a crisis made under the watch of the Liberal-National government. This government now needs to act and fix the growing waitlist. Labor will support this motion but calls on the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care to release this data immediately.</span>

                  </a>  It is a real shame that this government has failed to commit to any specific targets to reduce homelessness despite such disturbing numbers in the last census, with more than 100,000 people now without a home. People are sleeping rough, have no roof over their head, no bed to sleep in. They're on the streets and on park benches, and this number is up by 20 per cent. Here we have a government that doesn't care about the people they represent because they're so caught up in themselves. They're more committed to fighting each other than to anything else. People are suffering and bearing the brunt of an unfair system, caught in a cycle of disadvantage, and the Liberal-National coalition has no interest in breaking that cycle.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  As all Australians would be aware, since 13 September this year there have been a number of confirmed cases of people finding needless in strawberries. While the initial reporting concerned Berry Licious and Berry Obsession strawberries from Queensland, police and health authorities have warned of copycat cases across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 September, it was reported by the AAP that Australia's strawberry contamination scare has now spread across six states. The Home Affairs minister said on Wednesday that there were up to 100 reported cases, although many of these were believed to be hoaxes. In response to these and other stories of needles being found in fruit, some supermarkets have pulled their strawberries from their shelves. We know that our farmers are suffering and we are reaching a critical point where lasting damage to the industry could be done. This is a completely unacceptable situation and is having a devastating impact on strawberry farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has responded by making some changes to Commonwealth laws that it hopes will assist in deterring and prosecuting the individuals who have engaged in these recklessly destructive behaviours. According to a search of the Commonwealth Sentencing Database conducted by the Parliamentary Library on 19 September, there are no cases recorded against any of the existing offences in part 9.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code which deal with food contamination. Those offences were first introduced in 2004. While we have not had time to ascertain the reasons for this, it may be that the authorities have not used the existing Commonwealth offence provisions because of the existence of equivalent state and territory criminal offences in relation to the contamination of food. Those state and territory offences have a broader application than the equivalent Commonwealth offences due to the constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth's legislative powers. Those people who have caused the current crisis should face the full force of the law. What they have done is a despicable act with far-reaching consequences. I would urge all members in this place, when they leave Canberra today and tomorrow, to support the Australian farmers by buying a few punnets of strawberries at home and sticking it up on social media. Things like this matter.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to note that the opposition has been asked to consider and agree to this legislation in an extraordinarily short period of time. It's highly unusual for amendments to be made, in particular to our Criminal Code, without any consultation at all. We do not want to set this as a precedent for future legislation. On this occasion, we recognise the gravity of the situation at hand. Labor will be supporting the Criminal Code Amendment (Food Contamination) Bill 2018.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  The Australian Greens utterly condemn any tampering with food in a dangerous way in our country, as we have seen recently around strawberries. We regard that kind of action as completely unacceptable. As such, we are very open to supporting reasonable legislative change to do what we can to ensure a strong legislative framework in this area. But, let's face it, to describe the Criminal Code Amendment (Food Contamination) Bill 2018 as a rushed job would be an understatement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the officers of the Attorney-General's Department who briefed Mr Bandt and me on this bill this morning. I thank them for the time they provided to us and for the professional way they engaged with us. However, it needs to be on the record that this bill has been subject to no consultation whatsoever. It has not and will not be subject to any kind of parliamentary inquiry. As Senator Farrell has just said, it is most unusual for amendments to the Criminal Code to be made in such a short time frame. We have concerns about potential unintended consequences of this legislation, and we haven't had time to do the consultation that we need to do with our stakeholders and with people who we seek advice from with regard to legislation such as this. This leaves us in a very difficult position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On balance, we've determined not to support this legislation at this stage, simply because the government has not provided enough time for us to conduct consultations or for the normal inquiry processes of the Senate to take place. We regret that that has occurred. We want to, and do, strongly support our primary producers, including, in this case, strawberry farmers. We understand the impacts that the events of the last few days have had on them. However, due to our concern about the indecent haste with which the government is proceeding and due to the lack of opportunity for us to consult and for the Senate to do the job it would normally be able to do on legislation such as this, we are not in a position to support the bill at this stage.</span>

This bill urgently addresses significant gaps in Australia's current contamination laws. The bill tackles distressing recent events relating to the tampering of strawberries in Australia that have posed a risk to the safety of the Australian community and the livelihood of significant parts of our agriculture sector. It is a strong and necessary response to circumstances which demand nothing less. Families need to have the assurance that the Australian produce that they are buying is safe for their kids, safe for themselves and safe for their loved ones. Australian farmers need our support to ensure that their livelihoods are not put at further risk.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you are aware, we have not relied solely upon legislation in response to this challenge. The government has also committed $1 million to make more food safety officials urgently available to increase detection, fast-track recalls and assist the strawberry industry to rebuild confidence. It is essential that we in this place act quickly and decisively—and that is exactly what the government is doing—to ensure our criminal laws are appropriately adapted to the threats that we face. This bill reflects the absolute commitment of this government to do all that it can to keep Australians safe as they go about their everyday lives. The Criminal Code Amendment (Food Contamination) Bill 2018 strengthens penalties for existing offences and amends the nation's sabotage offences to deal with acts of food supply contamination that pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences we have witnessed from the contamination of strawberries demonstrates the public anxiety, economic loss and real-world harm that a rogue actor can cause. This harm has been amplified by copycat offenders and the perpetrators of hoaxes. This bill sends a very clear message: this behaviour is not a joke and it is not funny; it is a serious criminal offence which we denounce, and offenders will face serious consequences. It is already illegal to intentionally contaminate goods with the intention of causing public alarm or anxiety, of widespread or a nationally significant economic loss or of harm to public health. It is also a crime to threaten to contaminate goods or make false statements about the contamination of goods for one of those purposes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, recent events have demonstrated that the existing maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment is not high enough. The bill will address this by increasing the maximum penalty to 15 years imprisonment. This will send a strong signal to would-be offenders by placing the penalty at an equivalent level to child pornography and funding a terrorist organisation. There is a real risk that the recent event will inspire hoaxes and copycat offenders. These people need to know that, if they engage in this conduct, they will be committing a crime. The bill would create new offences that apply where a person contaminates goods, threatens to contaminate goods or makes false statements about the contamination of goods and is reckless to causing public alarm or anxiety, economic loss or harm to public health. These offences will attract a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recently modernised Australia's sabotage laws to address the unprecedented threats that we now face. These threats are constantly evolving and our laws must keep pace. These laws currently apply to the sabotage of public infrastructure and carry maximum penalties of between seven and 25 years imprisonment. Australia's food supply infrastructure is of critical importance to our national security and the wellbeing of our citizens. The bill will expand the sabotage offences so that they would cover the sabotage of Australia's food supply where such conduct is intended to prejudice national security. The bill marks an important step towards ensuring that our food supply infrastructure is afforded the same protection as other pieces of critical infrastructure. This work must continue. The issue will be raised with the state and territory counterparts to encourage them to strengthen their laws to ensure a robust, nationally consistent approach to the protection of food supply. It is also important to remember the human toll that these events are now having on Australian farmers and, indeed, a whole range of participants in the agricultural sector, who, as we know, are already doing it tough. Helping our farmers and farming communities is this government's No. 1 priority. As I've already stated, we have committed $1 million to deal with this crisis and help get the industry back on its feet.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The events of this week represent large-scale criminality relating to food products in Australia. Strong action is required to deter and punish those who would target our food supply infrastructure. Their actions hurt the Australian community. They sabotage the livelihood of growers, communities, towns and whole regions, and let us not forget the impact on small and family businesses. Their actions frighten people away from enjoying the beautiful, fresh, healthy produce that our farmers grow.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Supporting Australian Farmers) Bill 2018 is a bill that has Labor's support. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow immediate deduction, rather than deduction over the course of three years, of the cost of fodder storage assets, such as silos and hay sheds, that are used to store grain and animal feed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has made the case that it will assist primary producers by making it easier to invest in these assets. We know that this measure was announced on 19 August and applies to fodder storage assets first used or installed ready for use on or after that date. The economic impact of that measure on our fiscal bottom line is $75 million over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we on this side of the chamber are supportive of this measure, we do note what we have found to be the haphazard approach that the government has taken to the drought that many Australian farmers are unfortunately suffering from. Firstly, there was the increase in the farm household allowance payments from three years to four years, effective from 1 August this year. Then, a few days later, on 5 August, the government announced a $190 million drought package, claiming that it provided immediate financial support to farming families and their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frankly, given that the additional funding did not start flowing on 5 August, this is a bit of a stretch. We are yet to see how many farmers will actually access the farm household allowance supplementary payments. As the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for agriculture, has pointed out, there is in fact a real risk that farming families will miss out. They'll miss out on the full $12,000 because the government insists on splitting the payment and denying farmers the possibility of getting a lump sum payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second-reading speech, the Assistant Treasurer made mention of increased funding for mental health support, something which, of course, would be welcomed by both sides of the Senate, yet it was just last week that the new Prime Minister tweeted what was found to be an extremely insensitive video that claimed that drought 'is a necessary evil' that can help cut the 'bottom 10 per cent that shouldn't probably be there anyway'. This is not a message that struggling farmers need to hear at this time of crisis. We've called on the Prime Minister to apologise and to remove the video, but he has refused to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So to go to the tax aspect of the measure before us this afternoon, we on this side of the chamber support the principle that more rapid depreciation—what's known in the US literature as 'immediate expense'—can be good policy. Labor supported the government's instant asset write-off, and we did so noting that this government had scrapped Labor's instant asset write-off and then put in place their own instant asset write-off. On top of the instant asset write-off Labor has announced an Australian investment guarantee; it's an asset write-off that delivers for all companies investing in Australia. It's a much more targeted policy, stimulating and supporting the economy, than an across-the-board company tax cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to place on record today in the chamber that work carried out by Victoria University suggests that if you're after investment, then the best bang for your buck of an investment guarantee of more rapid expensing is three times larger than a company tax cut. Labor's Australian investment guarantee also has the benefit for firms that it is permanent and permanently accelerating depreciation for all companies, thereby ensuring that we're able to improve the investment pipeline that businesses deliver. So while I reiterate Labor's support for the bill here in the Senate for the supporting Australian farmers bill that targets these asset write-offs to farmers, it really does demonstrate that the government should consider the need for such measures across other parts of the economy. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  The bill before the chamber this afternoon, the Excise Levies Legislation Amendment (Honey) Bill 2016, is to remove the requirement for purchasers of honey who intend on exporting it to provide the seller with a certificate of their intention to export the honey. For those who are listening to this debate today, technically the honey industry no longer issues, receives or relies upon these certificates when selling to a buyer who intends to export the honey. However, the Senate needs to note today that this legislation was originally introduced in the House of Representatives in December last year. It was a companion bill to the Agriculture and Water Resources Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 to remove this redundant regulation, but, for some reason that I don't quite understand, the government has chosen to split the bills. I hope we will find out why this has occurred and what changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So while we on this side support this legislation, we would like to urge the Morrison government to support the honey and bee industries by taking seriously the issue of properly testing imported honey. We have had reports that currently Australian honey testing does not pick up adulterated honey. This is of particular concern. We don't want to see impure honey come into Australia. We want to ensure that the honey that comes in is pure, not only from a biosecurity point of view but also from a consumer point of view. As a consumer, I want to know when I buy and eat honey that it is real honey and that it has not got sugar or other additives in it, which mean, frankly, it is not honey at all. We've seen the government move quickly on strawberry contamination—as they should—but the government must also prioritise action to ensure that honey being imported is not adulterated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note that bees are absolutely critical to almost all agricultural industries, and consumers need to be confident that they are buying pure honey that has not been adulterated. It is important for our biosecurity and it is incredibly important for the values that consumers hold. The bee industry, like us, is today asking serious questions as to why the Morrison government has chosen not to act so strongly for their industry.</span>

We've already made changes as part of our National Innovation and Science Agenda to the tax treatment of ESVCLPs to make them more internationally competitive, to attract greater levels of venture capital investment and to incentivise investors to support early-stage innovation companies. This bill highlights the government's commitment to support innovative businesses in Australia and build a culture of entrepreneurship and risk-taking. Passing this bill will provide greater certainty to venture capital investors, improving access to capital for innovative Australian fintech businesses so that they can grow and succeed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I move amendment (1) on sheet 8454:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Schedule 2, item 2, page 6 (line 12), omit "either:", substitute "if you do not satisfy the maximum net asset value test (see section 152‑15)—either:".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through discussions with Business SA, and as per the discussions of their members with Treasury, my amendment deals with a mischief that the bill intended to address where a tax-paying individual shareholder in a company with significant assets and turnover does not satisfy the maximum net asset value test but qualifies for the small business CGT concessions under the $2 million turnover test. This might be achieved where a shareholder carries on a business in their own right that has a turnover not exceeding $2 million and that is entirely independent of the business of the object company—essentially, the taxpayer starting unrelated small businesses to access the concessions. However, the proposed changes in the bill go too far and include taxpayers who should sit outside the group of taxpayers the government wants to tighten integrity measures for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While there may be outcomes under existing law which are inequitable, the proposed changes punish the many for the sins of the few. This mischief identified could be easily overcome without creating a disincentive for collaborative investments by requiring that the shareholder satisfies the maximum net asset value test and cannot rely on the $2 million turnover test. This is a simple way of addressing this mischief without it creating unintended consequences. Therefore, my amendment on sheet 8454 is a simple omission in schedule 2, item 2, page 6, line 12 of 'either' and substituting it with 'if you do not satisfy the maximum net asset value test (see section 152-15)—either:'. These new restrictions mean that they do not apply to genuine small businesses that do satisfy the maximum net asset value test. Therefore, I seek the Senate's approval of this amendment.</span>

The government announced, in the 2017-18 budget, an integrity measure to ensure that the small business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted to genuine small businesses. Senator Storer's amendment would mean that taxpayers with less than $6 million in net assets could still benefit from the CGT small business concessions for the disposal of their interest in large businesses. Therefore, the government does not support this amendment, which is inconsistent with the policy intent of the small business CGT concessions. These concessions provide genuine small businesses with valuable relief from taxation on capital gains on the disposal of assets related to their business, allowing them to reinvest and grow as well as contribute to their retirement savings.</span>

Ensuring that the concessions are appropriately targeted ensures that they can continue to be provided to those businesses that need them the most—genuine hardworking small businesses—and, for those reasons, the government can't support this amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  Labor also opposes Senator Storer's amendment. As noted earlier in the debate on schedule 2, stakeholders have informed Labor that the additional conditions for eligibility for the capital gains tax concessions are detailed in a way that makes the changes more akin to a policy change than an integrity change and, as such, catches taxpayers who engaged in good faith according to the intent of the concessions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that the amendment to move the start date to 8 February 2018 deals with unintended consequences that arose when the exposure draft was released—that is, we accept the interpretation of many stakeholders that this went beyond just an integrity measure and had elements of policy change, capturing those who structured their affairs before the exposure draft and in good faith. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By removing retrospectivity, as the change in the start date does, we are comfortable with the bill passing. Nonetheless, I do want to note that Senator Storer and his staff engaged with us on this matter in a considered, thoughtful and constructive manner. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is sympathetic to some of the broader concerns that this measure and the intent of Senator Storer's amendment has raised—that is, what can be seen as a policy change as put forward just as an integrity measure. That does raise broader issues on how government and parliament address process issues around what defines an integrity measure. So, while we won't support the senator's amendment today, I think it's important to reflect on the broader issues that Senator Storer is addressing, and we thank him for his constructive approach.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Australian Consumer Law Review) Bill 2018. Labor has always been on the side of consumers. It was Labor that introduced the Trade Practices Act in 1974 and Labor that created the new Australian Consumer Law in 2010. It was a Labor federal government which, in negotiating the 2009 intergovernmental agreement on Australia's consumer protection arrangements—which preceded the Australian Consumer Law—built in a requirement that the new laws be reviewed within seven years. The Australian Consumer Law review was commissioned in 2015 and issued an interim report in December 2016, with its final report to federal, state and territory consumer affairs ministers submitted in March 2017. When these ministers met for their annual meeting in August 2017, they agreed on 15 recommendations for implementation, while referring a number of the other recommendations for further review, consultation or policy work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill because it clarifies, corrects and strengthens Australia's consumer protection and product safety regime. The measures in this bill have been agreed by state and territory consumer affairs ministers, consulted on extensively both through the review process and in an exposure draft, and are so uncontroversial as to be almost boring. But these measures do not fully implement all the provisions agreed by the government with the states. Of the 15 recommendations agreed to, 10½ are in this bill, one has been legislated in a previous bill, and two will presumably be enacted through regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in the bill are important, sensible and measured. They include provisions easing evidentiary requirements for private litigants through an expanded follow-on provision, enabling them to rely on admitted facts from earlier proceedings; amending the ACL and the ASIC Act to extend unconscionable conduct protections to publicly listed companies; amending the definition of 'unsolicited services' to allow the false billing provisions to apply to false bills for services not rendered; clarifying that the unsolicited selling provisions can apply to public places; enhancing price transparency in online shopping by requiring that any additional fees or charges associated with preselected options are included in the headline price; strengthening the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission powers to obtain information about product safety by broadening the power to apply to any person, including a consumer likely to have relevant information rather than just the supplier; enabling regulators to use existing investigate powers to better assess whether or not a term in a standard form contract may be unfair; and amending the ASIC Act to clarify that all ACL-related consumer protections that already apply to financial services also apply to financial products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three other proposals agreed by the federal, state and territory consumer affairs ministers have been or are expected to be implemented through other legislative vehicles. These include ACLR proposal 18, to increase maximum financial penalties available under the ACL. Labor took this policy, a tenfold increase in maximum penalties for anticonsumer conduct, to the last election, and we have been calling on the Turnbull and now Morrison government to implement it as a matter of urgency. We were pleased when the government announced that it would adopt Labor's policy in the 2017 budget. Legislation to implement the increased penalties was introduced into this house on 15 February this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we welcome this progress, 1½ proposals agreed by federal, state and territory ministers remain outstanding. The second half of one proposal, relating to unsolicited selling, is nowhere to be seen, while another recommendation to strengthen product safety recalls was featured in the exposure draft but removed from this bill for reasons known only to the assistant minister. This includes an important reform contained in ACLR proposal 7 to clarify and strengthen voluntary recall requirements by introducing a statutory definition of 'voluntary recall' and increasing penalties for failure or refusal to notify a voluntary recall, proportionate with other ACL penalties. These proposals were included in the exposure draft of this bill; however, they have been excluded from the bill as presented to the parliament. The government has not told us why or what happened to it. We don't know if the government has abandoned the change, contrary to the agreement it struck with states and territories last year, or if, like so many other consumer reforms, it has just kicked it off into the long grass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not unusual behaviour from this government. The coalition is yet to explain why it took six months for a compulsory recall of deadly Takata airbags, leaving millions of ticking timebombs on our roads. The potentially lethal airbags have been found to have misfiring inflators capable of firing shrapnel through a vehicle's cabin, risking life and limb of the driver and passengers. They can turn a minor accident into a fatal crash. Missing Takata airbags are believed to have killed over 20 people worldwide, including at least one Australian. The alpha airbags have been identified as particularly dangerous, with a failure rate of one in two compared to a failure rate of one in 400 for other Takata airbag models. As early as August 2017, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission told the House Standing Committee on Economics that the risks associated with Takata alpha airbags were such that they must be replaced immediately. ACCC chairman Rod Sims also revealed that, as the Takata recall was voluntary at the time, there was little enforcement action they could take to ensure everything possible was being done to replace the airbags. The following day, Labor called for the then minister responsible for product safety, the current Deputy Prime Minister, to use his emergency powers under section 132J of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to issue an immediate, compulsory recall for Takata airbags. This was done amid growing concerns about the inadequacy of the voluntary recall process and the renewed urgency around the alpha-type airbags. Then what happened? It took another six months, until February 2018, for a compulsory recall to be issued. What was the then Minister McCormack waiting for?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe those opposite don't want to change the law around recalls, because they would prefer to bury their heads in the sand when it comes to product safety for Australian consumers. This is emblematic of the government's half-hearted approach to improving Australia's consumer protections and its constant duckshoving of the portfolio between different frontbenchers. Those opposite make the right noises, rolling around consumer reforms that are already in train through reviews that Labor started, but in the end they always squib it. We have seen the government drag its feet with the payday lending reforms, we have seen it try to flummox consumers around measurement labelling and we have seen nothing but talk in relation to improving consumer protections for retirement home residents. Labor, on the other hand, will always work to improve outcomes for Australian consumers, with or without the government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Australian Consumer Law Review) Bill 2018. I wasn't planning to speak on this bill. However, I observed some quite thoughtful and considered filibustering, particularly from those in the coalition, on other bills this week, so I'm sure the public will be pleased to see such considered debate on legislation that has bipartisan support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance supports this legislation, which makes a number of amendments to the law to clarify and strengthen consumer protections. I won't be going into any further details about the provisions of the bill, as that's been fairly well covered, but I do want to take the opportunity to speak about an issue that relates to consumer protection, specifically protection for consumers from monopolies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of you would be aware that the ACCC recently approved CKI's takeover of the APA Group. Senator Molan stood up in the chamber the other night and made a considered and measured statement in a speech on the adjournment debate which represented some people within the coalition and sent a signal to others within his party—although I'm not in any way suggesting that is the position of the party. Senator Molan's contribution—unsurprisingly, noting that he's a former general—focused on the national security concerns with the project. I share his concerns, but noting he's already traversed that topic and it's not relevant to consumer law, I'll steer clear of this aspect and focus on competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to put it on the record that on 3 July this year I wrote to the then Treasurer, Mr Scott Morrison, requesting that he exercise his powers under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to prevent this takeover from occurring. On 12 September, I wrote to the current Treasurer, Mr Josh Frydenberg, setting out the same concerns and suggesting that on balance the takeover should not be allowed to proceed. APA Group own 15,000 kilometres of gas pipelines across Australia that keep gas-fired power stations running, keep large gas-energy users in operation and provide domestic customers with gas. In the 2016 ACCC east coast gas market report, the ACCC indicated that there was 'evidence that a large number of existing pipelines have been engaging in monopoly pricing'. The ACCC did not name APA Group, but it is clear that they are the dominant gas player in the east coast market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Switching to a recent electricity report, we note that in the ACCC's 2018 retail electricity pricing inquiry report the ACCC made a recommendation on the need for constraints on some further consolidation on generation ownership, given the existing levels of concentration in the market. They went so far as to recommend constriction on further concentrations beyond certain levels and mechanisms to force divestiture of assets or market share in particular circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a considerable economic concern for consumers in respect of APA's current east coast gas pipeline monopoly status. East coast businesses and consumers have only just finished experiencing the tops of gas prices, but they are still way too high. We certainly don't need any sort of reversal in our gas price fortunes. If this deal went ahead, particularly giving it reference to my constituents back in South Australia, we would see CKI in charge of 95 per cent of SA's electricity transmission arrangements—its wires, because they also own SA's power networks—and 85 per cent of its gas transmission infrastructure. The Grattan Institute's energy expert, Tony Wood, was quoted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> on 15 June as saying, 'You add APA to CKI and you get the mother of all gas monopolies; it will sit like a gorilla across the Australian landscape.' I note that he did go on to say, 'That doesn't necessarily mean that it shouldn't be approved, but it will be the ultimate test of our regulatory model.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we 're adjusting these laws, I want to suggest that the current regulatory framework also needs strengthening in other areas. Unfortunately, because of the way the law is defined, the ACCC was not able to recommend against the takeover because it was not creating a monopoly, simply preserving one. In my view, that's not good enough. Australia has many concentrated markets that are dominated by a few very big businesses, and our current competition law exists to prevent anticompetitive behaviour and misuse of market power. However, the ACCC is powerless to act if the transaction doesn't change the composition landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to concentrate on the end state here. The consumer laws are designed to protect us against monopoly situations. We do not let companies merge to get to a monopoly situation. Once again, that is recognition that the end state is a bad place. So we shouldn't also let a circumstance develop where, in this case, a foreign entity, but perhaps even a domestic entity, is permitted to buy into a monopoly where the end state already exists. Perhaps there's a way of, in some sense, regulating against monopoly status by making sure boards understand that if they get to a point where they do have that monopoly status, there is a risk that when they sell the company the ACCC will order it to be broken up in some way. In some sense the CKI model does that, because the ACCC said to them, 'You simply cannot conduct this takeover if you retain existing pipelines in Western Australia,' because that would have increased the monopoly status. I would like to bring that to the attention of the chamber. When we're considering consumer laws, we act to protect consumers—that's the responsible thing to do. We need to think about how we protect from the end state of a monopoly supplier.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I'm delighted to rise to assist the Senate in its careful consideration of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Australian Consumer Law Review) Bill 2018. I was listening carefully to the contribution made earlier by Senator Cameron. He said that this bill was so uncontroversial as to almost make it boring. I have two observations to share about that. Firstly, I would say that, clearly, Senator Cameron is his own harshest critic, because I didn't find his contribution to be boring at all. In fact, I thought it was a very good contribution. I would encourage him to be less harsh on himself in the future. Secondly, I say to Senator Cameron: challenge accepted. I hope in my contribution to this debate I'm able to maintain his and other senators' interest in this important piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing which I thought might be helpful in the consideration of this bill is to go through the key schedules in the bill. Schedule 1 is the admissions of fact, which relates to proposal No. 17 in the ACL review. This measure amends the Australian Consumer Law to ease evidentiary requirements for litigants through expanded follow-on provisions, enabling litigants to rely on admitted facts from earlier proceedings. This change addresses some of the difficulties that consumers and small businesses face when taking court action against traders under the Australian Consumer Law after the ACCC has already established a breach of law through the courts. Currently, what happens is that findings of fact made by a court in certain proceedings against a person may be used in certain other proceedings against that person under the ACL. This measure extends these existing follow-on provisions so that private litigants will now also be able to rely on admissions of fact made by the respondent in earlier proceedings as well as findings of fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An admission of fact brought across using this mechanism is not treated as conclusive proof in the new proceedings. It is prima facie evidence, which means that the respondent still has the opportunity to present evidence to rebut it. The measure will give consumers a better chance at successfully pursuing their rights against traders in court. The change will promote consistency with similar follow-on provisions in the competition law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning now to schedule 2 of the bill, it's the listed public companies section of the bill, which relates to proposal No. 9 from the ACL review. The measure extends the unconscionable conduct provisions in the ACL and in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to include publicly listed companies. The existing exclusion of publicly listed companies sought to confine the unconscionable conduct protections to those traders likely to lack the size and bargaining power to protect their interests. Public listing was seen as a reasonable indicator of a trader's size and ability to protect its own interests. However, public listing is not necessarily a reflection of a trader's size, level of resourcing or its ability to withstand unconscionable conduct. Where there is a significant imbalance in bargaining power, a publicly listed company could find itself subjected to conduct that is unconscionable. The unconscionable conduct provisions already protect some privately operated companies that may be, in fact, larger or better resourced than some publicly listed companies. Whether conduct is considered unconscionable will continue to be influenced by the relationship between the parties and the complainant's ability to protect their interests. The amendments improve both the clarity and the generic application of the unconscionable conduct protections by ensuring that they apply equally to all traders and support the ACL's objective of fostering effective competition and fair trading.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill is the unsolicited supplies part of the bill. This relates to the technical amendment A as proposed in the ACL review. This measure is a technical amendment to ensure a trader cannot demand payment for an unsolicited service that a consumer never asked for and never received. The ACL prohibits a trader from demanding payment for a service that the consumer never asked for. This is known as the false billing provision. However, the current interpretation of the false billing provision has made it difficult to enforce against suppliers of unrequested and unsupplied services, even where the supplier has falsely claimed they did actually supply the service. This measure helps to directly remedy this issue. For example, this has been a problem in the context of internet domain name services. Notices have been issued by resellers of registered domain names to traders with registered domain names asking for payment of a fee for renewal of that domain name when, in fact, it was for a variation on that domain name.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill relates to the unsolicited consumer agreements. That's relevant to proposal 12 in the ACL review. The ACL gives consumers certain rights when they enter an unsolicited consumer agreement. A typical example of this is door-to-door selling. This measure clarifies that those rights also apply where such an agreement is made in a public place. An unsolicited consumer agreement is an agreement which is the result of negotiations between a consumer and a dealer at a place other than the supplier's place of business. Certain other conditions need to be met, including that the consumer did not invite the dealer to come to that place. This is important because a consumer who enters an unsolicited consumer agreement gets certain rights, including a cooling off period of 10 business days, within which they can cancel their agreement. The original intention behind the unsolicited consumer agreement provisions was that public places would be covered. Nevertheless, there still has been some confusion about whether this is the case. This measure will stop that confusion. A consumer can be just as vulnerable in a public place as they are in their home or their workplace. They face the same risk of being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics and the transaction can be just as unexpected.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to schedule 5, the pricing schedule, which is proposal No. 13 from the ACL review. This measure amends the ACL to enhance price transparency by requiring that any additional fees or charges associated with preselected options are included in the headline price. This ensures that consumers are made aware from the start of the online payment process of the total possible amount they would pay if they do not opt out of the preselected options. Especially online, many traders preselect options attached to a consumer's purchase and it is up to the consumer to then deselect them before the end of the transaction if they do not want to take up these options. This has the potential to mislead consumers when they are unaware of the preselected options and do not have an adequate opportunity to opt out before proceeding to the payment. However, preselected options can be a legitimate business practice when they are not presented in a misleading manner, and this measure does not propose to interfere with that. For example, some businesses specifically offer and advertise bundled goods or services that include preselected options for the buyer's convenience. What this measure does is ensure that prices are transparent so that consumers are not tricked or surprised by hidden charges where traders preselect options on a transaction.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next schedule, schedule 6, which is the disclosure notices relating to the safety of goods and services, relates to proposal 8 from the ACL review. This measure amends the ACL to strengthen the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's powers to obtain product safety information by broadening the power to apply to any person, including consumers, likely to have relevant information, rather than only to the supplier. Currently, the Commonwealth minister, or an ACCC-appointed inspector, has the power to issue disclosure notices to obtain information about the safety of goods or services. However, these notices can only be issued to suppliers. Under current arrangements, the ACCC can only receive this information from third parties voluntarily. This may not always be possible or, indeed, appropriate, particularly where the third party may be subject to legal or confidentiality restrictions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure broadens this power so that the minister or inspector may give disclosure notice to a third party if the minister or inspector has reason to believe that the third party is capable of giving information, producing documents or giving evidence in relation to the safety of the consumer good or product related service in question. The kinds of third parties from which the minister or inspector might require information include other traders; test laboratories; safety consultants; consumers who have purchased or have been injured by a hazardous product; or another person injured by a hazardous product. This amendment will help regulators respond to product safety issues in a more timely manner. It will also promote consistency with existing information-gathering powers for other ACL provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 7 is the power to obtain information documents and evidence section, and it relates to proposal 11 from the ACL review. This measure amends the ACL and the ASIC Act to enable regulators to use their existing investigative powers to better assess whether or not a contract term is unfair. This will give the ACCC and ASIC the power they need to address the repeated or widespread use of unfair contract terms. Currently, the ACCC and ASIC are restricted in their ability to investigate compliance and take enforcement action with respect to unfair contract terms. This is because their investigative powers are triggered by contraventions, or possible contraventions, of the law. While the ACL provides a mechanism to void unfair contract terms in standard formal contracts, their use is not prohibited by the law. Therefore there are no contraventions or possible contraventions in relation to unfair contract terms. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 8 of the bill is the non-punitive orders schedule, and this relates to proposal 19 in the ACL review. This measure clarifies that a court may issue a community service order requiring a person in breach of the ACL to engage a third party at that person's expense to perform the service required in the order. A court may consider using the option when the person is in breach, is not qualified or trusted to carry out the community service itself. For example, a court could use this arrangement where a trader's conduct shows blatant disregard for the law, a trader has a history of mistreating consumers or it is evident that a trader clearly does not understand their legal obligations. An example of the type of community service order that might be made is the provision of financial counselling to consumers. Where a trader has used financial harm to low-income or vulnerable consumers, it may not be appropriate for that trader to provide such counselling. But it may be a very good outcome for the trader to engage a third party to provide the counselling. This is the kind of arrangement that this measure facilitates. This amendment will allow regulators to seek community services orders as a remedy to a breach in more circumstances because they no longer will have to rely on that trader to carry out the order but instead can now rely on a qualified third party. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 9 of the bill guarantees the supply of services, and this relates to proposal 5 in the ACL review. This measure amends the ACL to clarify the scope of an existing exemption from the consumer guarantees regime for the transport or storage of goods where those goods are damaged or lost in transit. The measure clarifies that the exemption only applies where both the consigner and the consignee are a business. The rationale behind the exemption is that, if the buyer or intended recipient of the good being transported or stored is a business, an exemption for the shipper or transporter is appropriate because the commercial buyer should have insurance or other contractual protections. This rationale does not generally hold true when the recipient is a consumer. This measure will ensure that consumers do not bear the full risk in circumstances where they have no control over the shipper or transporter. It will also ensure that consumers are clearly able to seek remedy directly from the shipper rather than relying on traders to raise issues with the shipper.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 10 is the consumer protection schedule of the bill, and relates to technical amendment B in the ACL review. The ASIC Act contains consumer protections for financial services which mirror a number of provisions in the ACL. These mirror provisions largely use imported language from the ACL. This means that, at times, the language is inconsistent with that used more generally in the ASIC Act, and may also unintentionally limit the application of certain provisions. This measure is a technical amendment to correct inconsistent terminology in the ASIC Act for financial products that involve interests in land that could unintentionally limit their application.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 11 of the bill is the consumer protections schedule in relation to financial products, and relates to proposal 16 in the ACL review. Senators will be pleased to know that it's the final schedule. This measure amends the ASIC Act to clarify that consumer protections that already apply to financial services also apply to financial products. This measure is designed to address a source of unnecessary uncertainty. The current provisions explicitly cover financial services and indirectly apply to conduct related to financial products. This is because 'financial services' has a broad definition. However, the absence of an express reference to financial products creates uncertainty. Explicitly covering financial products is also consistent with ASIC's existing approach to compliance and enforcement.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Australian Consumer Law Review) Bill 2018. This bill is a measure to clarify and strengthen consumer protections relating to consumer guarantees, unsolicited consumer agreements, product safety, false billing, unconscionable conduct, pricing and unfair contract terms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection of consumers is a critical role for government. The recently debated legislation to protect the strawberry industry—I'm sure we'll see more of that today—and the safety of consumers is another demonstration of how important consumer protection is. The fact that the government has moved so quickly on that issue is demonstration of the high value it places on consumers being able to trust that which they buy in the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Consumer Law commenced operation as Australia's first nationwide consumer protection law in 2011, replacing provisions in 20 Commonwealth, state and territory laws on consumer protection and fair trading with a single national law. This means that, for the first time, consumers will have the same rights no matter where they live in Australia. The Australian Consumer Law, which we already have some familiarity with, includes: a national unfair contract terms law, covering standard form consumer and small business contracts; a national law guaranteeing consumer rights when buying consumer goods and services; a national product safety law and enforcement system; a national law for unsolicited consumer agreements, covering door-to-door sales and telephone sales; simple national rules for lay-by agreements; and penalties, enforcement powers and consumer redress options for when things go wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been an important micro-economic reform that has provided quite substantial benefits to all Australians. A national and consistent approach to consumer law and policy enables all Australian consumers to enjoy the benefits of consistent rights wherever they may be, and allows all Australian businesses to obtain some efficiencies through a single and simplified national law. This makes things easier for all Australians, whether they be consumers or in business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well-informed, confident consumers are a vital element of a strong and vibrant economy. The introduction of the Australian Consumer Law has been good for both consumers and businesses. Consumers are more empowered, business compliance costs have reduced and there are fewer disputes. This is because having one national Australian Consumer Law means that we have cut down on red tape. For example, before the Australian Consumer Law, businesses operating in more than one state or territory had to comply with different laws, wasting time and money and creating confusion.</span>

In response to the substantive question at the end of the Senate's question, I said that the government would continue to consider all options to help boost women's super. But I am also pointing out our very strong track record, including our measure to enable catch-up concessional contributions, which will benefit 230,000 Australian, including those women with interrupted work patterns or irregular income, such as farmers and carers.</span>

This will hurt the retirement savings of anyone with irregular income or work patterns, including mothers and carers who have taken time out of the workforce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has introduced the comprehensive Protecting Your Super Package, which will stop the rorts and rip-offs in the superannuation sector, providing significant benefits to the financial security of millions of Australian women. Around two million women who hold low-balance inactive accounts will be protected from erosion through excessive fees and inappropriate insurance. Around 1.6 million women who are still contributing to low-balance accounts will also see hundreds of millions of dollars— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What you can see here is a strong and united team working hard to make Australia stronger, to keep the economy strong, to keep Australians safe and to keep Australians together. And, yes, we will continue to work very hard to ensure that hardworking Australians who work hard all their lives and put money away for their retirement are protected from the onslaught that would come if Mr Shorten became Prime Minister, where he would put his hands into their pockets to fund Labor's reckless spending in government—as he did last time, when he was in government.</span>

While those opposite, aided and abetted by the Tasmanian Greens, would smash the budget and wreck the economy—as they did last time—so there would actually need to be cuts, this government treasures senior Australians, which is why we look after the economy. Unlike those opposite, we believe senior Australians deserve to be treated with respect and dignity—and that needs a good economy. Unlike those opposite, we are making a record investment in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, this government's investment in aged care is going up by a billion dollars a year over the forwards estimates. In 2017-18, aged-care spending reached $18.6 billion and over the next five years funding will grow by $5 billion to $23.6 billion. That is $5 billion more to ensure senior Australians receive the best possible care. While those opposite continue to mislead and try to frighten older Australians, we will continue our record investment in funding. This government is increasing the number of home care packages from 87,000 in 2017-18 to 151,000 by 2021-22. This will include an increase of 34,000 in high-level packages by 2021-22. The immediate rollout of 14,000 additional high-care places began in July. This is on top of the 6,000 high-level home-care packages announced in MYEFO. There's $90 million to support aged-care providers. Of this, $40 million will support aged-care services in regional and rural areas. We are also providing $50 million to support residential aged-care providers and their staff to improve safety standards and quality of care.</span>

We're establishing an independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, with more than $300 million, to police the sector. We're providing a one-stop shop for all aged-care consumers, their carers and loved ones on quality of care and services. We will ensure genuinely unannounced visits by auditors. We're introducing new aged-care quality standards that clearly spell out what consumers can expect from aged-care services, and that will be supported by a new charter of rights. We're continuing to support independent advocacy services for senior Australians to address potential elder abuse in aged care, with $31.7 million being provided to the Older Persons Advocacy Network by 2020. We will always look after regional Australia and our seniors that live there.</span>

With only one other question this year, it's a real relief that we can actually focus on this matter. There is an increase in demand for home care because seniors have chosen—and we are the party of choice—to stay in their homes rather than move into residential care. That's a choice that they have made. So the demand, especially for high-level packages—level 3 or 4—continues to increase. This is a reflection of the desire of older Australians to remain in their homes as long as possible. So this government is addressing this demand through an additional $1.6 billion investment—</span>

It's gone from 68,657 people—that was on 31 December 2016. A year later, on 31 December 2017, we had 77,918 people.

We provide a home care package—something that they're talking about—but we also provide additional funds beyond the packages. I will give you a comparison. Personal care, mobility, domestic assistance, nursing, nutrition and transport for the home care packages. The Commonwealth support package: domestic assistance, home maintenance, transport, meals. Identical. For the Commonwealth home support package, we provide $2.7 billion. If you're asking, 'Who isn't on a home care package?' it is more important to say, 'Who isn't on either?'

                  </a>  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. First, Senator Canavan puts to you that these are very detailed and somewhat obscure statistical questions. My point is I would not have thought 'how many older Australians are on the waitlist for home care?' is obscure, given the current political circumstances. If the minister is unable to answer the question, we understand he may have to take it on notice. He has not done the chamber the courtesy of responding in that way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  On the first point of order raised by Senator Bilyk, I was listening very carefully. The minister was talking about, for lack of a better way of putting it, home care funding arrangements. I do consider that to be directly relevant to your second supplementary question. On your point of order, Senator Canavan, I would suggest that the context of that in <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span> is a little bit different. Also, it might rule out a number of questions from the government's side when they want to talk about other economic statistics, so I don't think it should be applied that narrowly. Senator Wong restated the question and made a point about a minister being able to take a matter on notice, which ministers are always free to do. I call Senator Scullion to continue; he has 18 seconds remaining.</span>

I can advise as follows: Senator McKim, you would know that obviously we do not comment on individual cases. What I can say is that the ABF takes all reports of assault seriously and refers them to appropriate law enforcement agencies for investigation. I'm advised that the department and its service providers have policies and procedures to appropriately respond to incidents in immigration detention, including alerting relevant law enforcement bodies. The department does not tolerate abuse or assaults by staff, contractors or detainees within immigration detention facilities, and the department acts swiftly and decisively to ensure the safety and security of all detainees and staff.</span>

Minister, given your previous answer, can you confirm it's the case that detainees in Australia's onshore immigration detention system cannot make complaints to ABF or Home Affairs officers and can only make complaints to Serco staff, and that Serco staff do not wear name or ID badges that would allow them to be identified? How can you be sure that this matter has been referred to the police and how can the minister possibly fulfil his duty of care to detainees? </span>

On this side, we are completely united and in particular when it comes to my portfolio of small and family business, skills and vocational education. Let me tell you what we're united on. We are united on the fact that, under this government, we will continue to lower taxes for the Australian people. We have made a commitment to small and family businesses that we will lower their tax to 25 per cent. We are united in keeping that commitment. We are also united in ensuring that every Australian small and family business knows that a vote for Labor is a vote to put their taxes up. What the Labor Party want to do, colleagues, is put their hands into the pockets of small business and take money to spend on their unsustainable promises. Oh, we are united on this side. We stand for lower taxes. Those on the other side stand for higher taxes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:29</span>):  My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. Australians are concerned about the concentration of critical Australian assets in the hands of foreign-owned multinational companies. I can hear you muttering, 'Why should we worry about foreign investment because foreigners cannot take assets, including infrastructure, out of our country.' But that is not the point, because what we are seeing is a concentration of assets in the hands of a few multinationals who go on to use their market power to raise prices for Australian consumers. In hindsight, it is clear that many decisions made by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the ACCC have resulted in reduced competition and higher prices for Australians. Divestment powers in the Competition and Consumer Act are weak. What is the government going to do to strengthen divestment powers in the Competition and Consumer Act?</span>

I do agree that foreign investment is very important for the future economic development of Australia, as it has been important for our past economic development.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons why we are so committed to ensuring that we have an internationally competitive tax regime and that we are internationally competitive overall in terms of our policy settings is so that we continue to be able to attract foreign investment into Australia to help develop the Australian economy to its full potential, to create more jobs for hard-working Australians and to ensure that families here in Australia have the best possible opportunity to get ahead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I have also indicated in response to a question earlier this week, of course any relevant foreign investment proposal that has got implications for our national interest needs to be properly assessed to ensure it's not contrary to our national interest. We have specific regulatory arrangements in place as a result of legislation passed through this chamber earlier this year to deal with critical infrastructure in particular, to make sure there are proper processes in place to protect the national interest, to protect the public interest, in relation to critical infrastructure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important with these things for us to get the balance right and ensure we continue to be an attractive destination for foreign investment. This will help us to continue to develop our economy and ensure that Australia is as strong as it possibly can be, creating opportunities for Australians to get ahead, but also making sure that, as appropriate, we protect our national interest and we ensure that we don't receive foreign investments that would be contrary to the national interest.</span>

I know he is a passionate supporter of the development of northern Australia, and particularly of northern Western Australia, of course. There have been some very important developments in our northern Australia development plan. It is the first time in our history that a government has had a white paper and a plan to develop northern Australia. It was a great pleasure this week to announce a $95 million investment from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility towards Sheffield Resources' Thunderbird mineral sands project in the Kimberley region. This project is an incredibly important project, principally to create 400 jobs in the Kimberley region during construction and 280 jobs over the life of the mine.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our northern Australia agenda is all about creating jobs and opportunity for people who live in northern Australia, and this project will do that in spades. This project is going to be staffed completely by locals in the Kimberley region. The proportion of Indigenous people in this part of our country is 44 per cent. I give credit to Sheffield, which has set a target of 40 per cent of its employees to be Indigenous Australians. Today, 60 per cent of Sheffield's employees are Indigenous. It is already beating its target, which is a fantastic outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This project is important also because it produces products that are essential for modern life. I can see a number of senators on their phones and iPads. I'm sure they're listening intently to my answer to this question, but they're also looking at modern technologies that need mineral sands, that need zircon and titanium for their production. We need these mines and a strong mining sector to be able to use our phones and our iPads. Without mining we wouldn't enjoy any of these modern products. We have so many of these products here in Australia.</span>

Solar panels require 16 different minerals for their construction, and 10 of those 16 minerals are produced here in Australia, so we have enormous opportunities.

We've got one of the richest and most diverse supplies of minerals of any country in the world. This opens up enormous opportunities for Australia in lithium, mineral sands and rare earths.

This is a project that will also create jobs and opportunities in northern Western Australia. Lithium of course is in massive demand around the world, and we are the world's largest producer of lithium. We have tripled our lithium production in eight years, and we have great potential to further that development, as well. This particular investment will help do that in Western Australia. There are also opportunities to go into the supply chain of lithium, to process the lithium spodumene into hydroxide, and create even more value and jobs opportunities for our country.</span>

Minister—through you, President—Newstart has not been increased in real terms since 1994. That was 24 years ago—in fact in the year of the birth of my colleague Senator Steele-John. Today, the base rate of Newstart will rise by an indexed amount of $2.20 a week, and the government claims this will help those on the payment keep up with the cost of living. Minister, what does the government think people can buy with an extra 30c a day?</span>

One thing that all of us in this chamber can be very pleased about is that our nation has a very good and strong record of having payment arrangements to support people who are in difficult circumstances, often for reasons beyond their control. As I have said before, one of the ways that you can guarantee as a nation that you can provide assistance to fellow Australians when they need it is by having a strong economy and a well-managed budget. We want and will see a continuation of a sustainable welfare system that supports the most vulnerable, that encourages those capable of work or study to do so and that reduces intergenerational welfare dependency. </span>

                  </a>  Newstart is primarily a payment designed to assist people transition through the labour market. For this reason, Newstart recipients are able to earn income from work or other sources before their payment is affected. Around two-thirds of those granted Newstart exit income support within 12 months, and over 99 per cent of Newstart recipients receive more than just the base rate of Newstart. For example, their payment may include the energy supplement, rent assistance for those in the private rental market and family tax benefit for those raising children. We do absolutely remain committed to ensuring that social security payments are well targeted and sustainable into the future.</span>

Your pursuit of Minister Dutton, you might as well have chased him with a wet lettuce leaf. Honestly, you should be embarrassed for relying on the fabricated evidence of the disgraced former ABF commissioner and you should be embarrassed for hyping up this Senate inquiry only to see it fizzle out. </span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much, Mr President. Mr Dutton is, of course, a very effective minister, protecting our borders, keeping our nation secure. He has cancelled 3,763 visas of non-citizens who have committed crimes, including, 684 convicted for assault, 270 child sex offenders, 69 murderers, 193 for violent offences and 194 outlaw motorcycle gang members. The Minister for Home Affairs has cancelled more visas of non-citizen criminals in the last 12 months than Labor did in 12 years. You know what? I am being asked questions about interventions by Minister Dutton. Minister Dutton has used his intervention powers on 4,816 occasions in the nearly four years since December 2014. Do you know how many times Mr Bowen and the member for Gorton used their powers in just two financial years? 23,000 times. The Labor Party are completely hypocritical in relation to this.

I have to say that it's disappointing to hear Senator Cameron laugh. Senator Cameron, your former government presided over one of the worst rorts in the VET sector that this country has ever seen. When we came into office we became aware of the extent of Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP. They allowed shonky and dodgy providers to sign up vulnerable students to courses. The students had no capacity to complete the courses. They were offered inducements to complete the courses. They had no capacity at all or they didn't even know that they were signing up for a loan. We continue to clean up Labor's mess. What we have now done is introduce further legislation to ensure that we support the VET sector in Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give a real-life example of someone who suffered as a result of Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP. A lady by the name of Anita enrolled in good faith in a diploma of business over the phone in 2012, never having been told that she would be liable for the course fees. She made a decision to withdraw from the course shortly after commencement and contacted her provider. Mr President, do you know what happened to Anita as a result of Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP system? She was saddled with a debt of $18,000 because of the conduct of a dodgy provider allowed by those on the other side. Well, on this side of the chamber, we're going to go into bat for people like Anita, and we are going to ensure that we do the right thing by her and bring the VET system's reputation back— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I mean, imagine the strife that the Australian economy would be in if that attitude were brought to bear in terms of our trading relationships! One in five Australian jobs depends on exports, on trade, on opportunity. And, of course, at this time of global uncertainty, in terms of the way in which the trading relationship operates, Australians need to know they have a government that values our relationship with the world and puts the ability of Australian farmers and small businesses to sell their products and services to the rest of the world as one of the most important things that the government can do for them. Of course we, on this side, know that Australian farmers and businesses are much better off today as a result of our government's work over the last five years in ensuring their trade and market access is improved as a result of the deals and agreements we've pursued with China, with the Republic of Korea, with Japan, through the TPP, and building, indeed, on the work of the Howard government in terms of the United States.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But do you know how much trade market access was improved during the six years of the Labor government, how many deals were struck during those six years and what work occurred? Absolutely none—zero; a big fat zero. Why do you think that might have been the case? It was probably because the then Labor government had the attitude that Senator Wong brought to bear in that question just then. They don't take trade or foreign affairs seriously. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Indeed, on a day when Prime Minister Morrison and Mr Tehan, the new education minister, have announced a further increase to what is already a record investment in supporting Australian schools, does the Labor Party come in here and ask any questions about policy or investment in schools? No—of course, their questions are about petty personality politics and anonymous quotes from the newspapers. Our government is investing record sums into Australian schools. That record level of investment went up again today, providing more funding, more choice and more opportunity for Australian parents and more support for schools and Australian schoolchildren. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country there has been a long tradition of a professional public service. There's been a long tradition of an impartial and accountable public service. Under the coalition, this impartiality has been attacked. It has resulted in this government appointing their mates, their advisers and their people who will do their bidding in the public service to senior public service positions. The Liberal Party commenced this approach when former Prime Minister Tony Abbott sacked Martin Parkinson, an independent, well-respected secretary.</span>

                  </a>  This is the problem we have here. Senator Macdonald interjects that he was left-wing. I don't think anyone that looks at the service that Martin Parkinson has given to this country would say he's left-wing. The only reason Senator Macdonald would interject in such a way is that Martin Parkinson was dealing with the issue of climate change under the previous government. That's what you get from this bunch of muppets—that's how their own Prime Minister describes them; a government full of muppets—and we just heard from one of the muppets how they feel contempt for professional, well-accomplished public servants.</span>

                  </a>  It is not only my view, Senator Macdonald; it's the view of people that have worked with Mr Parkinson. Mr Parkinson was seen to be so effective that he was appointed secretary of Prime Minister and Cabinet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get a bit of reality here. It's no wonder the Prime Minister calls this lot 'muppets'. These are the extremists in the coalition. They deny climate change, and they went out and knifed their last Prime Minister on the basis that they didn't think that he should have even been mentioning the words 'climate change'. This is an appalling situation. Senator Macdonald epitomises the nonsense that goes on in this divided government that is on its last legs and cannot focus on the real issues for working people in this country. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the current Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, commission and selectively release Treasury work that purported to attack Labor's economic and tax policies. A number of examples of that have been seen over the last year. This is an example of the politicisation of the public sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just unacceptable that we have to wait this length of time to get answers from the government to reasonable questions. I know why they couldn't give the answers—they were too busy knifing each other. They were too busy putting the numbers together to try and get rid of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. But, when they got the numbers together, the Leader of the Government in the Senate couldn't even count and his preferred candidate couldn't get up. This is the nonsense we have here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A public service should be professional. A public service should be impartial and accountable. When you put your mates in there, when you put an ex-adviser like Mr Gaetjens in as Treasury secretary, then you know there is a problem. How can Mr Gaetjens be impartial and accountable? He can't do it. Scott Morrison appointed his chief of staff as Treasury secretary. What a joke. How can Labor and other parties in the parliament have confidence in a Treasury secretary who spent the last few years attacking the opposition's policies? The main attack dog on Labor policies has now been appointed as secretary of the Treasury. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury is supposed to put together a blue book for an incoming government. If we are fortunate enough to win the next election then Mr Gaetjens, the person put in there to basically run the government's agenda in Treasury, will be putting together the advice to the Labor opposition. How can we accept advice from a partisan player? How can we accept advice from someone who has—and I use the word loosely here—the pedigree of being the adviser to the worst Treasurer this country has ever had, former Treasurer Peter Costello? How can we have any confidence in this Treasury secretary? He's supposed to provide frank and fearless advice. He's supposed to be frank and fearless in what he does for government. We can have no confidence in that. This is a partisan political player. This is typical of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Public Service is supposed to be ethical. It's supposed to be values driven and it's supposed to act in the public interest. Mr Gaetjens cannot operate in a non-partisan way. It's clear that he has been the behind-the-scenes attack dog on Labor's policy. The culture of this government is to politicise the Public Service. It is just unacceptable. I'll look with interest at the responses that we have from Senator Cormann in relation to the questions that we asked. We did ask a whole range of questions that went unanswered, so Senator Cormann's responses will make interesting reading. And I must say I think they will point to the problems that we have with this government. Not only did it sack one of the most prestigious public servants in Martin Parkinson; it has also given us Senator Cash, this disgraced minister who misled the Senate on at least five occasions, who will not cooperate with the Australian Federal Police and who has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to cover up her involvement in the raid on the AWU offices and the use of the Registered Organisations Commission to attack her political opponents and the union movement. How can we trust this government when it gets down to that level?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've only got to look at Senator Cash's appointments in the past. To the Australian Building and Construction Commission she appointed Nigel Hadgkiss. Nigel Hadgkiss spent years attacking the trade union movement on a massive salary, appointed by this government. This is a supposedly independent public servant who breached his own legal requirements as a commissioner. These are the types of people that this government appoints in senior Public Service positions. He had to resign in disgrace, but not before Senator Cash and this government, with the ABCC, ploughed, again, hundreds of thousands of public dollars into trying to cover up the breaches of the act that this public servant was supposed to be the guardian of. What a joke. What an absolute joke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner, John Lloyd, who was nothing more than a partisan political player in all of his appointments ever in this parliament. He led the attack on working people in Western Australia through his appointments to the public sector in Western Australia. This is the modus operandi of this government: put your mates and your ideological attack dogs in senior public service positions and ensure that they deliver the government's agenda to attack their political opponents. It's an absolute disgrace. When the Public Service was closing in on him and his actions were being exposed, the Public Service Commissioner John Lloyd resigned in disgrace and resigned in ignominy. These are the types of people that this government appoint to positions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got the Registered Organisations Commission itself. The Registered Organisations Commission are supposedly an independent organisation, but now we see quite clearly that they are nothing more than another attack dog for the Liberal Party and the coalition against the trade union movement, workers' rights and workers' capacity to actually bargain effectively. The coalition appointed Mr Mark Bielecki as the head honcho of the Registered Organisations Commission. This guy couldn't even tell me in estimates where the offices of the Registered Organisations Commission were. He is nothing more than a figurehead and a front for the Registered Organisations Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The person who is in there to do this government's bidding is a Mr Chris Enright. Mr Chris Enright is the attack dog in the Registered Organisations Commission to attack working people, to attack their trade unions and to try and make sure that the union movement is on the defensive continually under this government. Mr Chris Enright is the very Chris Enright who put together, while he was a member of the Australian Crime Commission, a secret file on a Labor frontbencher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the types of disgraceful appointments that this government make continually, and what they do is they diminish the Public Service. They mean that Labor and the public generally can have no confidence in what the Public Service does in terms of fearless advice. The ethics of the Public Service get dragged down with these types of appointments. You've just got to look at what some of the press have been saying about these appointments. Bernard Keane says that the appointment of Phil Gaetjens has degraded the Public Service to 'a partisan think tank'. Imagine the Treasury being seen as a partisan think tank—one that, as Bernard Keane says, 'contributes little to the polity and the public life of this country'. Bernard Keane goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The many problems of Costello's treasurership -- the short-term and long-term fiscal indiscipline, the corruption of the retirement incomes system, Costello's inability to see anything outside the leadership prism—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">were all done when Mr Gaetjens was a senior policy adviser to Mr Costello. What Bernard Keane says is that there were some impeccable candidates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been on the economics committee. I've been on estimates committees. I've seen some of the Treasury officials—highly competent, non-partisan—bring the position that they should have impartiality and accountability—even though it's difficult to get them to be accountable sometimes at estimates! But they do bring the position that the Public Service should bring—impartiality—to the table. When you put someone like Mr Gaetjens in as the Treasury secretary—who has been a political warrior, a political attack dog, a political friend of the coalition—in a senior position, the highest position in economic thinking in this country, then it is a disgrace. That's why we can have no confidence in Mr Gaetjens. We had no confidence in Nigel Hadgkiss, and he ended up resigning in disgrace after being given a golden handshake by the coalition to give him a reward for breaching the legislation that he was supposed to enforce! You can't trust these political attack dogs and you can't trust the muppets across this chamber. You cannot trust them. There is Mr John Lloyd. Instead of the government taking action to make sure that he applied himself in an impartial way, they simply allowed him to resign. They allowed him to resign over his disgraceful behaviour. His partisan behaviour, in handing information to the Institute of Public Affairs, was a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are. Those are the types of people that this government is putting in key positions in the Australian Public Service. This has diminished the Australian Public Service. It's good to know that the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has said that one of the key things that he has to do is restore the independence and non-partisan nature of this most important body: the Treasury. It is a disgrace that the coalition would plant political partisan appointments in key positions in the Australian Public Service to actually push their agenda and attack their political opponents.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go back to what I was saying. The shadow Treasury spokesperson, Chris Bowen, has said that he is about restoring the independence and non-partisan nature of the Treasury. What could be more important than an independent and non-partisan Treasury? Yet this government, which their own PM describes as 'muppets', are in there destroying the independence of the Treasury, destroying the independence of the Public Service. I've only given you some examples. The disgraced Nigel Hadgkiss, the disgraced John Lloyd, the disgraced Chris Enright are in there as partisan political players for the coalition, attacking their political opponents and using government institutions to attack their political opponents. This is a government whose time has long gone, like Senator Macdonald—his time has come and he is going. He couldn't even go on his own terms. He had to be chipped out, thrown out by the electorate of the Liberal National Party in Queensland—a disgraceful government; time's up.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. It certainly is a debating point, and Senator Cameron is denying he was a mate of Eddie Obeid's and the bad Ian Macdonald, the Labor Party minister from New South Wales. Is Senator Cameron denying that? What a gutless, despicable speech from Senator Cameron. He's a bit like former Senator Conroy, attacking public servants who have no way of responding. And Senator Cameron is typical of the Labor Party. Public servants aren't in this chamber and they cannot get up and defend themselves as I can. Senator Cameron won't stay to hear my responses to his despicable attacks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Public servants are there to do a job. They are not part of the political process. Senator Cameron, Senator Conroy before him, and most Labor politicians and senators at estimates will attack public servants personally, knowing that they cannot respond to these vicious, personal and deliberate attacks by members of the Australian Labor Party. They are disgusting in the way they do that. I remember how Senator Conroy made an accusation to General Campbell, who everybody knew was an honest, reliable, first-class soldier, currently Chief of the Defence Force but in those days doing the job that his government had given him to do. He was subject to the sort of despicable comment you've just heard from Senator Cameron on public servants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He speaks about a number of other public servants who are simply not in a position to defend themselves, although one of those he named—I can't be more specific than this—has sought to respond in the rules of the Senate to some of the despicable, personal and untrue allegations that were made by members of the Australian Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And for Senator Cameron to talk about others making political appointments to the Public Service is just laughable. We have no better example than one who has just walked into the room—my good friend Senator Watt—who was a failed Labor member of parliament in the Queensland parliament and appointed then into the Queensland Public Service. I mean, if Senator Cameron wants to talk about examples like this, he only has to look over his shoulder and see that the Labor Party is full of this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been in this chamber for a long time and, regrettably, I've lived through 12 years of Labor governments. They continually politicise the Public Service. Not often were they ever criticised by our side of parliament, because these political appointees, having been appointed, are public servants, and it's not our wont to actually politicise them. But the Labor Party know no bounds. I don't know all the other public servants that were mentioned by Senator Cameron, but I know Mr Hadgkiss did a wonderful job as an Australian bringing law and order to a very disorderly part of our economy—disorder that was promoted by the union movement, who put Senator Cameron in this chamber here. Mr Hadgkiss did a wonderful job in bringing law and order to an industry that had been unlawful.</span>

                  </a>  Thanks, Deputy President. I would just say on that spurious interjection and interruption by Senator O'Neill that I was actually responding to comments that her colleague Senator Cameron had made in this debate—and the debate is not on government principles; it is a debate to take note of something that Senator Cormann did.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure members of the Labor Party that I'll be back after the next election. I will be back, and I will be doing that in the same way as your colleague Senator Singh did on one occasion—and I suspect will do again. I know that there is a lot of disloyalty, disruption, backbiting and division within the Labor Party, but I think Senator Singh will be back—and I'll be glad. She is a senator who shows the strength of her convictions. She is prepared to buck the machine, and good on her. It just shows the absolute division within the Labor Party. If you want to speak more about the division in the Australian Labor Party, let's have a look at their position on trade matters. Half of them are on one side and half of them are on the other side. They don't know where they are at. And, of course, Mr Albanese is there pushing on all this disunity because Mr Albanese sees that his time as Leader of the Opposition is fast approaching.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to a point that Senator Cameron always makes in attacking a female minister, one of the best ministers, who just so happens to be a female minister. You don't see Senator Cameron attacking too many male ministers in this place. In attacking Senator Cash, one of the best ministers we have had, Senator Cameron told mistruths about her, saying that she was disgraced and that she had misled the parliament. She is certainly not disgraced. I don't know if Senator Cameron thinks that if he says the word 'disgraced' often enough someone will eventually believe him. She is a brilliant minister. She is not at all disgraced; in fact, she is revered. She is looked up to by most Australians, because she did such a wonderful job in exposing the union movement for all of the rorts, dishonesty and illegality that it is involved in. Senator Cash did that, and because of that she has paid the ultimate price. The union movement, with their pockets of gold, are determined to get rid of her—and Mr Dutton, another very effective minister who stands up for what is right. The union movement, with their pockets of gold, will do everything they can to destroy Senator Cash and Mr Dutton—but it won't work in either case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unions will continue to attack Senator Cash. Why? Senator Cameron often talks about a raid on a union office. He seems to think that that is a problem. The police got a warrant to go and raid, to investigate criminal activity. And what was the criminal activity that they were investigating? It was whether or not Mr Bill Shorten, then a leading unionist, had misappropriated funds that had been given to the union movement into his campaign account for his tilt at being elected to parliament.</span>

                  </a>  I don't know whether that's true or not, Senator O'Neill, but we do know, on the record, what that was all about. It was a police investigation—properly done with warrants—into a parliamentarian's office to see whether there had been criminality in the transfer of funds from the union movement to Mr Shorten's campaign account prior to his election here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the last thing Senator Cameron or the Labor Party want to discuss is that particular issue. They are doing everything possible to derail the investigation into that alleged criminality. Senator Cameron will come in here and attack Senator Cash every day of the week. Why? It is because Senator Cash was the minister—she didn't make the decision of course; it was the authorities—who the authorities in her department decided needed to look into those allegations of criminality. But you never hear that from Senator Cameron; it's always, 'Oh, this raid on a member of parliament's office.' That's not the issue; the issue is: was there criminality by Mr Shorten in transferring, without authority, funds from the union movement to his campaign account? That's the question. Suddenly everyone has gone quiet. That's the issue that Labor Party senators don't want to be raised at this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All I can say is that Senator Cash has done a wonderful job, as has Mr Dutton in his role as border protection minister. He is the home affairs minister, who keeps Australians safe and keeps our migration policy operating properly. GetUp! and the unions, who fund the Labor Party and the Greens, don't like that, so they'll do everything they can to destroy those people. I see they're even trying to destroy my friend and deputy leader. He has been a wonderful minister in every portfolio that he has touched, whether in government or opposition. He has done a wonderful job. He's being attacked now for being promoted. I can't follow the logic of Senator Wong's attack on Senator Birmingham for his well-deserved promotion in the last reshuffle.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I return to my real point here. I have been here a long time and I have seen some robust debates in this chamber, but never have I seen these sorts of despicable, gutless attacks you get from members of the Australian Labor Party on public servants, who have no way of answering back. Senator Cameron can and does attempt to bully me, shout me down, accuse me and tell lies about me all the time. I don't mind that. I'm in this business, I have a thick hide and I can defend myself—I have the opportunity to speak. But Senator Cameron's regrettable, gutless and despicable attacks on public servants have happened only in recent years. I think it shows a lack of leadership in the Labor Party that those sorts of personal attacks on public servants are allowed to continue. The Senate and the Australian parliament are worse for that action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is one of the unwritten laws or conventions always followed that in this chamber you do not attack people who are not in a position to defend themselves. That is particularly so with public servants, who because of their roles always show—the word is not properly used—deference to parliamentarians because they see that parliamentarians are elected by the people, and they pay respect to them. They won't argue with politicians, because that's not their role or part of their appointment criteria. Politicians who come in and personally attack public servants, who they know have no ability to respond, deserve the contempt of the Australian people and I might say do achieve the contempt of the Australian people.</span>

I'm amazed that Senator Cameron ever has the gall to mention this subject. Senator Cameron has never and can never deny that he was a good mate of Eddie Obeid, who is now serving time in jail, and the man who regrettably has my name—Ian Macdonald—and was a Labor minister in a New South Wales government I think of Senator Keneally. Senator Cameron was mates of these people. I understand that they protected his preselection. They helped him knife in the back his colleague George Campbell. I remember Senator George Campbell, a Labor senator here—not a terribly effective one, but he did the job and he did it honestly. Senator Campbell was a nice enough fellow. I understand he thought that Senator Cameron was a friend of his. But we all know from reading the newspapers that Senator Cameron knifed him in the back to get his position here in the parliament. And Senator Cameron well knew that, had he stood for preselection for the next election, he would have been beaten because people have long memories in the New South Wales Labor Party and the knives were out for Senator Cameron. He didn't even have the guts to fight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Cormann to a question I asked a long time ago at the beginning of question time. My question was about the fundamental right that Australians now have, have come to expect and perhaps think this country has always had—that is, the right to expect when you work that your employer will contribute superannuation. There was a time when that didn't exist. Certainly, I grew up in a part of the country where superannuation wasn't anything that was discussed around the kitchen table in Curran Street, Blacktown, where I lived. But the Labor Party instituted superannuation for all Australians, a universal scheme, and those opposite in government—and you just heard a speech from one of their representatives—were so out of touch at the time we set it up that they said it could never work, that businesses would fail and the whole economy would fall apart. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're still out of touch, because today when I asked Senator Cormann to actually recognise the fact that, right now in Australia, Australian women will retire with 42 per cent less in their superannuation balance than Australian men who are working in the same country, the same economy—42 per cent less. The calculation of that amount is about $113,000. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann, the Leader of the Liberal-National party who will seek the vote from the Australian people to come back in here, couldn't even answer that question and confirm those facts. Part of the reason he can't confirm those facts, and perhaps he doesn't care about those facts, is that his coalition are going to—and this is what he said—continue to consider all options. That's what they've been doing for five, nearly six years—considering all those options. And do you know who they've been leaving out the whole time? Australian women. They haven't got enough women who want to join their party, who want to stay in their party or who want to be a voice in their party because it's dominated by men who simply think that they know better and refuse to acknowledge the reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you looked around this chamber at question time, you would have seen 15 women here in the Australian Labor Party out of a team of 26—15 of us—standing up for women. It's not just the team that's here—and I want to acknowledge the great work of Labor parliamentarians, men and women, over years who have advanced the cause for women to get fair and decent superannuation. We've come up with a policy to address that. And the voice of women has been loud in that debate inside our party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side, there are 30 Liberal-National party members. Only eight of them—only eight—are women. Having an absence of a women's voice in your political party in this day and age is absolutely a failure. This government is failing on women's representation and, because of that, it's failing to provide adequately for the women of this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question was to Senator Cormann asking him if he will invest the $400 million that Australian Labor are going to invest to make sure that women are going to have a secure financial future so that, when they go on maternity leave, they'll get their maternity leave, which Labor delivered, but they'll also get a superannuation payment on that of $1,100—roughly that amount. That's going to translate to a massive improvement in the amount of money that they will have on retirement. I will just go to the example of a woman who gives birth to a child at 27 and another at 29—two children; she's under 30. The difference that this policy of Labor—this $400 million investment in the women of this country—will make is $24,350. That is no small amount. We understand, as the Labor Party, with the strong voice of strong women, that we have to do better for 50 per cent of this population, who are retiring in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question was to ask the minister if he knows, if he can verify that older, single women are one of the fastest-growing groups falling into homelessness. If they spent just a minute or two at their local real estate agents and saw who was coming in and the desperate state that Australian older women are in, they'd know that they need to change their policy. They could have matched Labor. They're the government. They could have said on Monday that they were going to institute it straight away. But they didn't. What they're doing to do is what Senator Cormann said—they're going to continue to consider all options. Well, they've been considering the wrong options for too long, and Australian women deserve better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I'm glad Senator O'Neill has raised the issue of superannuation. It's been very interesting, the royal commission, hasn't it, Senator O'Neill, when we look at superannuation there? Of course, we're well aware that, if Labor had put the terms of reference forward for the royal commission, superannuation would not have been included—you could bet on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are questions to be asked about superannuation and who's earning what and what they're going to retire on. Senator O'Neill might answer a question for me, when I asked why, years ago, in 2007, Australian Super donated $27½ thousand to the Australian Workers' Union. It is quite amazing. Who were the directors of Australian Super then? You wouldn't believe it, Madam Deputy President: Senator Cameron was a director! And it goes on. Who was another director? Former Labor minister Greg Combet!</span>
              </p>

                  <a href="I0V" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WILLIAMS:</span>
                  </a>  You've picked the next one. I'm getting to it; you'll just have to be patient, Senator McAllister. And another director was? Mr Bill Shorten! So the superannuation fund donates $27½ thousand to the Australian Workers' Union and they list it as 'a donation', in 2007, to the Australian Workers' Union. What did they do shortly afterwards? The Australian Workers' Union donated $25,000 to where? To the election campaign fund of one Mr Bill Shorten. Of course, 10 years later, in 2017, the AWU changed it from 'a donation' to 'other'. So if we want to talk about superannuation and how much money is left, Senator McAllister, I'm glad we've got it in the terms of reference in the royal commission—which you never would have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking of working women, I want to see them earn more super and have a better retirement as well. But one person we should be thanking is this minister sitting in front of me for his change to day care subsidies and allowances. When it peaked out at $7,000, when half of the women went to work what was the story? They were working for taxation and for child care, and for nothing else; they were working for, basically, nothing. So isn't it great that Minister Birmingham did that? And congratulations to him on his promotion to trade minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the question from Senator Wong—well, if Senator Wong's going to keep Senator Keneally on the back bench, she's going to have to do better than that, because I know Senator Keneally. As I said, she's not used to riding down at the back of the bus; she wants to be up the front of the bus—in fact, she wants to be driving the bus. So if Senator Wong wants to keep those divisions from behind her away, she's going to have to do much, much better than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's quite amazing that the coalition has a proud record of introducing real, tangible measures to help women save for their retirement, including the low-income superannuation tax offset, which benefits around 1.9 million women by over $500 million. Do those opposite give any praise for that? Of course not. Levelling the playing field by scrapping restrictions on who can make personal deduction contributions benefits 800,000 Australians, including those women working in roles without access to formal salary sacrifice arrangements. Catch-up concessional contributions will benefit 230,000 Australians, including those women with interrupted work patterns or irregular income, such as farmers and carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know what Labor will do. It will simply hike taxes. We know there are $200 billion worth of taxes planned if it were to win the next election—an extra $200 billion on the Australian people. That's what Labor has done all its life—spend, spend, spend; tax, tax, tax; borrow, borrow, borrow; and run up government debt. It doesn't matter whether it is at state level. It doesn't matter whether it is at federal level. Labor has a history of building debt, big time. Its then Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, was going to have the budget in the black years ago. As I've said in this place before, black print at the bottom of a budget is something Labor simply does not understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the coalition, there are more women working than ever before and more women working full-time than ever before. Working women, of course, are getting superannuation. What we've got to do is get the snouts out of the trough of the superannuation. The royal commission has made it very clear that there are institutions out there that are simply robbing and ripping off people's superannuation, and hence their retirement fund is so much lower. I hope the royal commission makes some serious recommendations about superannuation, about seeing that not only the women but the male workers as well have a much better retirement fund, because that's what it's for. The coalition has done a good job on benefiting working women. I commend, as I said, the day care support now, which is a real incentive for women to work and to work longer, not only to earn their wage and benefit their family but to earn superannuation as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  More than two years ago, a Senate Economics References Committee inquiry, which I chaired, published its report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">A </span><span style="font-style:italic;">husband is not a retirement plan'</span>. That reflected the very words said to our committee by an older woman who wanted to make it clear to younger women that they would need to take responsibility for their own financial future. The truth is, of course, that a third of Australian women enter retirement single. Many other Australian women may enter retirement with a partner, but their partner, like them, has a very modest superannuation account. The idea, in any case, at the level of principle, that a woman ought to be dependent on a man in her retirement just does not fly in 2018.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, the government released their response. It took them two years to come up with their response to the recommendations made by that Senate inquiry. The shorthand version of what that response said to the proposition that a husband is not a retirement plan is basically this. They said, 'Well, actually, ladies, a husband is your best bet.' That is essentially the response that was provided by the government to the more than 18 recommendations that were in that report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in question time, I asked about whether or not the government would match Labor's commitment to pay superannuation for women when they are on parental leave. All we got was waffle. The truth is that they don't have any meaningful response whatsoever when it comes to the appalling state of women's economic security in retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of measures that the coalition like to point to when we raise this issue. I want to just take the time to point out how the answers that they provide, the things that they say answer this question, are no answers at all. Senator Williams pointed to the opportunity for people to make catch-up concessional superannuation contributions. What the government claim is that this measure will help women by allowing them to make additional tax-free super contributions when they're working to make up for the period of time that they spend out of work caring for someone else. The problem is that the majority of Australian women, and particularly those who spend extended periods of time out of the workforce, do not make the kind of money that allows them to make these catch-up contributions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry Super Australia did the numbers. They ran the numbers on this proposition and they said that this measure would assist less than two per cent of women who have super accounts. They said that it would mostly help women with superannuation balances of over $600,000 a year. Well I can tell you that's not your average woman who's been off on maternity leave. And your average woman doesn't have $30,000 lying around that she's just going to chuck into her super account now that these arrangements have been relaxed by the government. This is a measure that will benefit high-income men. This is not a measure that benefits women, and it is absolutely shameful that, time and time again, Senator Cormann comes into this chamber and asserts that this is a measure for women. It is actually a lie and he should stop saying it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also say that they will provide measures to allow men, essentially, to tip money into women's super accounts. They'll change the arrangements to make that easier. I tell you what: this tells you a lot about the Liberals' view of gender relations, but it doesn't do a lot for women who cannot or do not want to rely on a husband or a partner for economic security. Economic independence is the thing women need if we are to escape generations of subordination to men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann likes to talk about the fact that they reinstated the low-income superannuation contribution. I'll tell you what actually happened. This was a Labor initiative that made sure that low-income women didn't pay more tax on their super than other people were paying. The government abolished it. They abolished it. So when they say that this is their initiative, what they've actually done is put our tax concession back and they've given it a new name. It used to be the LISC and now they call it the LISTO. It is exactly the same measure that was introduced by Labor. It is no new measure at all. They're the three measures that they say help women, and every single one of them is either a Labor measure or has no impact on women at all. It is disgraceful, and they ought to be ashamed of themselves.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  It was interesting that Senator O'Neill mentioned women becoming homeless. Back in 1998 there were 100,000 people in Australia sleeping rough—transient; between different people's places, on their couches; sleeping under bridges—and the age group covered anywhere between six years of age right up to about 95 years of age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, and the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, assisted the efforts of young people to attack the scourge of homelessness in this country. They did so by donating one of their own personal coats to a group called Enormity, which bases itself in Ulverstone in Tasmania. At the time, these young people were the age of about 15, and one of their friends became homeless. They borrowed a coat and provided it to this young person, who was sleeping in doorways with no possessions, no money and no food. They thought they would provide that person with protection from the winter elements and some warmth. That's what they thought they could do. But in questioning these young people about whether there were any more homeless people that they knew out there, they said they did know of more. So they set about creating a public appeal for the donation of winter coats. Today the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister donated the 99,999th coat and the 100,000th coat to a young adult, Mr Jack Crawford, who was a member of Enormity six years ago. This marks 20 years of hard work by these young people who went out in the winter elements and collected coats from people who were kind enough to donate their own winter coat to help those who were homeless and in need. They came in all sizes and all shapes. We even had members of the public going to local stores and actually buying new coats and donating them to help the homeless. We even had visitors—</span>

One hundred thousand coats in 20 years is an extremely huge target and a very proud moment for these young people, especially receiving that from the leader of the country. Over the last 20 years, they've collected a coat from every Prime Minister, starting with Prime Minister John Howard. This investment by these young people shows that they are caring and that they know. The learnings that they got from that has enabled them to move into life and into the workforce to earn money and contribute to our community. They've been able to build a better life for themselves and for others. The contribution that they've made is not only through their volunteer work but also through their working life and productivity. They earn money so that they can put it into superannuation themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's funny: as we go along, we talk about putting money into superannuation and we talk about the government assisting people. The Labor Party, when they were in government not so long ago, had the opportunity to assist young people in their working life to be able to earn money and invest in superannuation, but, instead, there was a knee-jerk reaction to an issue and they said, 'We're going to build new school halls. We're going to invest in that. Instead of investing in young people themselves, we're going to build unneeded and unwanted school halls,' and they did. They built them and they weren't up to specifications. They built them and they weren't able to be used multipurposely. It was a poor investment. That's what's happening at the moment: we're wasting a lot of money through knee-jerk reactions. We're wasting a lot of money— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247512" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KITCHING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Cormann today. The minister's answers reveal, in stark terms, the complete failure of the shambolic Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government to understand the problems facing working women in Australia today. That's not surprising, because the government have no interest in working women, do nothing to promote talented women and do not respect the women they do have in this place. That's why Julie Bishop, the member for Curtin, the most high-profile woman in the coalition parties, polled only 11 votes when she contested the Liberal leadership; that's why the member for Chisholm has been driven out of parliament; and it's why the member for Gilmore is quitting politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1994, the coalition parties had more women in this parliament than Labor did. On both sides, fewer than 20 per cent of members were women. Today, more than 45 per cent of Labor members are women, while the coalition is still stuck on 20 per cent. They are on track with their current preselections to ensure Australia has fewer women in the parliament than they have in the Saudi Arabian legislature. This is not just a matter of symbolism; it explains why the coalition government disregards issues of primary importance to women. It explains the policy vacuum revealed by Senator Cormann's answers today. It's why the coalition government is doing nothing to address the gross inequalities that still face working women today, still face older women and still face retired women in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far too many older Australian women are living in poverty despite having worked for most of their lives. This is because women disproportionately work in lower-paid jobs, because many women are still not getting equal pay for equal work—which is an utter disgrace—and because many women take time out from work to raise children, a task which still falls almost entirely on women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is good news. A Shorten Labor government, if elected, will help women plan for a secure financial future. It will strengthen Australia's superannuation system and boost women's superannuation balances. In summary, the measures will pay superannuation on Commonwealth paid parental leave and dad and partner payments. They will phase out the $450 minimum monthly income threshold for eligibility for the Superannuation Guarantee. They will make it easier for employers to make extra payments into a woman's superannuation fund, and they will consider the impact that any future changes to super that might occur might have on women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the effects of the current superannuation system is that women retire with $113,000 less, on average, in their super than men. The average superannuation balance at the moment for women upon retirement is $157,000. For men, it's $270,000. Older women, particularly single, divorced or widowed women, are more dependent than men on the aged pension. Older women are the fastest-growing cohort of homeless in Australia. In our large cities and, indeed, in smaller towns, we have seen an increase in homelessness. In the city of Melbourne, my hometown, you can see this on the streets in the CBD area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government won't even acknowledge these realities, let alone do anything about them. This is a government which has little knowledge of and interest in the lives of working Australians, particularly working women. This 'muppet show' of a government is more interested in its own internal feuds and hatreds than it is in the lives of Australian women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands the lives of working women. They are the people we represent in our electorates. They are the union members. They are the women who have responsibilities in trade unions. They are the women in our branches. They are the strong and capable women who we have brought into this parliament and elected to senior positions. Some of the best women in all of the parliaments of the world are Labor members and senators in this very parliament, and we should be very proud of that. We are never going to treat issues of importance to women as second-order issues, as this coalition does. The other part of this policy change is that we will amend the Sex Discrimination Act to ensure that businesses are able to make higher superannuation payments for female employees if they wish to do so. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator McKim today relating to asylum seekers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I have revealed in the Senate today is a system inside Australia's onshore immigration detention network that is deliberately designed to dehumanise and to avoid accountability for the people that are running this system. I have here a complaint of sexual assault that's been made by a detainee against a Serco staff member. I simply asked the minister if she could confirm whether this matter had been referred to the police. What we got from the minister was the standard: 'Nothing to see here. We don't comment on individual cases.' Well, Minister Cash, I'm not asking you to comment on individual cases. I'm asking you: has this complaint been referred to the police? That's an entirely reasonable question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you read these documents, some of the problems inside Australia's immigration detention centre become clear. My understanding—and I put this to the minister today and, I might add, she hasn't rejected it—is that the Serco officers do not wear any identifying materials at all. No number, no name. How are you supposed to make a complaint against someone when you can't actually identify them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you read this witness statement that corroborates the allegation of sexual abuse, what you see is this witness saying, and I quote from the statement, 'I observed the tall, white, bulky Serco officer.' That's the best he could do: the tall, white, bulky Serco officer. Then, later in the statement he said, 'I observed the Caucasian and the bearded ERT officers being very aggressive towards the complainant.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a real problem here. Detainees in our onshore immigration network actually cannot properly identify officers against whom they wish to make complaints. We also, as I understand it, have a situation where, in fact, detainees in our onshore immigration detention network cannot make their complaints to the government. They can only make them to Serco, the contractor that the government has arranged to run these detention networks. That's not good enough. These people are in the government's duty of care. It is the minister who is responsible for these people. It is the minister who is responsible for ensuring they are treated in accordance with the convention against torture, to which Australia is a signatory. We have a human rights framework in this country for a reason, and the minister oughtn't simply ignore his responsibilities under that framework. We hear an awful lot about the horrors of offshore detention, but what is becoming increasingly clear is that there are horrors in Australia's onshore detention regime.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have provided copies of these documents to the whips, so I seek leave to table the complaint of sexual assault and the corroborating witness statement.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. I can assure members that the horrors of Manus Island and Nauru are very well known, and they have, quite rightly, dominated a lot of the public debate and a lot of the conversations in our community. The community is reacting in horror to what is happening on Manus Island and Nauru, where we have children swallowing razor blades and where we have children in catatonic states, and this government is fighting tooth and nail in our legal system to keep them away from the medical treatment they so desperately need. We know the systemic child abuse that goes on in Nauru. We know that the men on Manus Island had drinking water, food, electricity and medication cut off on Mr Dutton's orders late last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But now we are seeing, rolling out slowly into the public consciousness, an awareness of the horrors of our onshore immigration detention system. I want to explain one case very quickly in the short time left to me. There is a stateless man that has been nine years in our onshore detention network. For goodness sake, senators! The overwhelming majority of rapists in this country don't get sentenced to nine years imprisonment! It's unconscionable that he's still there. We need to clean up our onshore immigration detention centres.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, I table this report into our committee's inquiry into Australia's domestic trade in elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn. I initiated this inquiry to examine whether or not Australia's legal domestic market, as it currently stands, is contributing to poaching or illegal trade and if Australia should take more of a legislative, regulatory and enforcement measure to further restrict or even close down our domestic market in these products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I speak about the detail in the report, I want to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that in 2017 there were 1,028 rhinos killed in South Africa, while between 20,000 and 50,000 African elephants are killed each year to supply the illegal ivory trade around the globe. That equates to about one elephant every 26 minutes. Earlier this month, Elephants Without Borders reported it had discovered the fresh and recent carcasses of 87 elephants close to the protected Okavango Delta wildlife sanctuary in Botswana, killed and stripped of their tusks by poachers. The most common poaching gun is the AK-47. Increasingly, poachers spot elephant herds from helicopter and target their prey from above. Poachers also use machetes, spears and even watermelons spiked with cyanide. Sadly, despite growing international attention, the recent elephant poaching is driven by extraordinary consumer demand for their tusks, delivered through organised crime. Yet the existence of legal domestic markets around the world that continue to fuel the poaching crisis in Africa includes Australia. The rate of annual elephant losses still exceeds the birth rate, which means extinction of these species in the wild is the only current possibility. Indeed, earlier this year we lost Sudan, the planet's last male northern white rhinoceros.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we on the committee learnt during this inquiry was that Australia is not immune from contributing to this global problem, both as a consumer market and, given our close proximity to the Asian region, as a transit route. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's 2016 <span style="font-style:italic;">World wildlife crime report</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: trafficking in protected species </span>identified Australia as a destination and transit country for ivory, and we heard that repeatedly throughout the inquiry. Investigations of online traders, auction houses and antique dealers in Australia revealed, during the inquiry, domestic markets for ivory and rhinoceros horn worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Across a nine-month period in 2016, the International Fund for Animal Welfare found 2,772 ivory items for sale at 175 auctions in 21 auction houses in Australia and New Zealand. They of course include carvings, figures, jewellery, walking sticks, billiard cues, picture frames and the like, but they also include raw carved tusks. A carved rhinoceros-horn cup was sold for A$67,000. Every piece of ivory—every tusk, every carved statue, bracelet or trinket—represents an elephant who has paid the ultimate price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A census in 2016 estimated the number of African elephants has declined to around 350,000. Further, it found the African elephant population had declined a further 30 per cent between 2007 and 2014. In the last century, we've in fact witnessed a 95 per cent decline in that species. In recognition of this ongoing problem, in 2016 the international community agreed to a non-binding resolution that called upon all members of the CITES treaty to implement a domestic plan on elephant ivory. Since that time, a significant number of countries have implemented such a domestic trade ban. The world's largest consumer of elephant ivory, China, implemented its ban in 2017. The world's primary exporter of elephant ivory products, the United Kingdom, is currently in the final stages of reviewing its legislation that will implement a domestic ivory trade ban. The United States legislated its ban in 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But Australia is yet to introduce an equivalent ban. Within Australia, the domestic trade of ivory and rhinoceros horn remains unregulated. It remains legal. As the rate of slaughter as far as higher than the rate of reproduction, the extent of poaching, fuelled by this consumer demand and the existence of legal domestic markets for ivory and rhinoceros horn, is driving these species into extinction, and we are contributing to that. In the past four years, 36,000 people have written to the Australian government supporting a domestic ban.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Galaxy Research conducted a poll last year on behalf of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, it found that 77 per cent of the Australians that were surveyed thought that trading in elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn within Australia was already illegal and a further 76 per cent want the trade banned. So this is why we took the steps that we did in this inquiry to put our first recommendation in place, to call on the Australian government through the COAG process to work with the states and territories to implement a ban on elephant ivory and rhino horn trade. We need to do what like-minded countries have done and ensure we are no longer a destination country that is fuelling the poaching crisis going on in Africa, and support our African countries, as they're calling for us to do, to ensure that we give value back to these animals so that our children will see these animals in the flesh and not just in picture books in future generations, like we currently do with the Tasmanian tiger. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill will implement recommendation 11 of the July 2014 Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee's report into Commonwealth procurement procedures, for the Department of Finance to establish an independent and effective complaints mechanism for procurement processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is consistent with obligations in the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement, to which Australia has submitted a bid to accede, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-11), which was signed on 8 March 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These obligations require Australia to maintain an impartial and independent body to review and provide remedies for government procurement complaints. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The text of these obligations, and the broader agreements, are publically available for the consideration of Senators. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Beyond meeting international obligations, the Bill will also ensure that regional suppliers and small and medium enterprises have timely access to justice to raise complaints about procurement processes and seek remedies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill designates the Federal Circuit Court (FCC) with jurisdiction (concurrently with the Federal Court of Australia) to receive and review local and international supplier complaints in relation to a breach of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill requires the supplier to first complain to the Commonwealth entity responsible for conducting the procurement. The entity must investigate the complaint and, if the supplier is not satisfied with the outcome of the procuring entity's investigation, they can seek remedies from the FCC, including compensation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compensation will be limited to the reasonable costs for the preparation of the tender, or the costs relating to the challenge, or both. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The FCC, with its streamlined processes, will provide an accessible way to lodge complaints, particularly for regional suppliers as it maintains a continuous presence outside major capital cities. Suppliers from rural and regional Australia will not need to travel to major cities to lodge a complaint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is not intended to fully prescribe the procedures by which the FCC hears procurement complaints, but rather address three key areas where the FCC will need different jurisdiction and procedures than its current functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I will briefly outline the key elements of the Bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jurisdiction</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will confer jurisdiction on the FCC to hear government procurement complaints where a supplier considers that the CPRs have been breached. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Suppliers must provide evidence of their complaint, including that they have attempted to resolve the complaint with the procuring entity in the first instance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Timely, Transparent and Effective Review Procedures</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will ensure that the FCC can facilitate timely, transparent and effective review of complaints. Timeliness is an important feature for current procurements, where there still may be an opportunity for the supplier to continue to participate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill specifies a 10-day timeframe for suppliers to make an application to the FCC to encourage timely efforts to resolve any concerns about a procurement process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Bill also provides flexibility for the FCC to allow a longer period for applications if there are genuine reasons for the delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Remedies and Corrective Action</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will preserve a supplier's ability to participate in procurements by offering remedies and/or compensation if the FCC finds that the CPRs have been breached. Any compensation ordered would be limited to the supplier's reasonable costs incurred in preparing the tender and/or seeking to resolve their complaint. The FCC will not be able to overturn awarded contracts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The decision to vest jurisdiction in the FCC was informed by extensive consultation between the Department of Finance and the Attorney-General's Department. This included a scoping study, which considered three options for a body to hear supplier complaints. The study considered vesting a federal court with jurisdiction, designating an existing administrative entity and establishing a new tribunal, and concluded that the FCC was the most efficient and accessible mechanism to administer this function. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill shows the Government's commitment to transparent and competitive procurement by giving suppliers the opportunity to seek remedies and improve Commonwealth procurement practices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak about the current Prime Minister's shameful record on aged care. What do you get when you cross an inept government, which has spent five years ignoring aged care, with a new Prime Minister who was the architect of cuts that have absolutely gutted aged care? You get an aged-care sector in crisis. That's what you get.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He can deny it all he likes, but it was Mr Morrison's cuts to aged care that brought us to the aged-care crisis we're seeing now. It's mystifying that this out-of-touch government have decided that something is terribly wrong in aged care. I've been pushing for and calling on those opposite to take ageing and aged care seriously for years, but my calls have fallen on deafened ears. They were too busy trying to get the numbers for the former Prime Minister's job to focus on what really matters. But now, with an election around the corner, we've got a new Prime Minister acting like he's a friend to older Australians and proclaiming that aged care is a priority for him. Well, I don't buy a word of it and neither does the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison, if aged care is such a priority for you, why keep it out of cabinet? If aged care is really a priority for you, when are you going to respond or action the dozens of reviews and reports on aged care that are sitting collecting dust? If this is really a priority for you, why haven't you committed funding to the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce you so proudly announced last week? And, if you really care about older Australians, when are you going to provide an adequate solution to the home care package waitlist crisis?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the new Prime Minister is the man behind cuts that have gutted aged care and put the sector under immense pressure. Mr Morrison's cuts to aged care as Treasurer have been listed in this place all week, but I will keep going through them until those opposite step up and take responsibility. One of Mr Morrison's first acts as Treasurer was to slash almost $500 million from the aged-care funding in the 2015 MYEFO. He followed this with an even bigger cut—$1.2 billion from the aged-care funding in the 2016 budget. And, even as the waiting list for home care packages blew out to more than 108,000, Mr Morrison's budget this year did not deliver one extra dollar of funding to aged care—not one extra dollar. And don't forget the 26,000 residential aged-care places he also cut in this year's budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister must take responsibility for his part in this. He cannot pretend his cuts as Treasurer were nothing to do with him or that they have had no impact in the community. Mr Morrison's response to his cuts has been appalling. He spent this week belittling his cuts to aged care and accusing us of lying for calling him out on them. You only have to look at the budget papers signed off by the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. His name is on the papers in black and white. These are the cuts that he's denying. Page 101 of budget paper 2 says, 'The Government will achieve efficiencies of $1.2 billion over four years'. The budget papers don't lie. Under Mr Morrison, aged care received one of the harshest cuts in his budget: $1.2 billion slashed from residential aged-care subsidies for residents. In his budget speech on 3 May 2016, Mr Morrison said, 'In this budget we will continue to cut unnecessary waste'. Mr Morrison, do you still consider aged care to be unnecessary waste?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In budget estimates hearings the same year, the government made it clear that it expected aged-care providers to ensure the same high quality of care would be delivered despite the huge funding cut. Let's be clear: you cannot slash aged care and expect the same level of care to be provided. It just can't happen. You do not fix aged care and the crisis that it's in by cutting the funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind you that Mr Morrison made this $1.2 billion cut without any idea of the impact it would have on the most vulnerable older members of our community. Well, I can tell you that older Australians are feeling the full impact of this cut. Just look at Monday night's <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program. When Mr Morrison made this cut, he was cutting from those in aged-care homes with the highest and most complex needs. That's what this Prime Minister cut when he was Treasurer. This cut was not about aged-care residents missing out on a glass of wine with their dinner; it was about the frailest and most vulnerable people missing out on things like physiotherapy to manage chronic pain, or the oversight of specialist medications for cardiac conditions, dementia and Parkinson's disease. Mr Morrison's cuts were the difference between receiving physiotherapy to manage chronic pain and living with chronic pain. What a disgrace! The fact that the new Prime Minister could stand in front of the cameras and in the House of Representatives all this week and deny his cuts is unbelievable. Frankly, it tells you everything you need to know about the new Prime Minister and what he's all about. He's a wolf dressed up as a sheep crying crocodile tears. Older Australians deserve better than a Prime Minister who cuts funding to aged care and then lies about it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite had it pretty good when they came into government. Labor had done all the heavy lifting to transform our aged-care system with the Living Longer Living Better reforms, and the opposition at that time were part of those deliberations. All those opposite had to do was oversee the rollout of our reforms in a timely manner. But that was too hard for them. They bungled it because they never had their eye on the ball. They've always treated aged care as an afterthought. You only have to think back to when Bronwyn Bishop was the minister, and the kerosene baths, and the Howard government's reputation for the way they treated older Australians. When Mark Butler became the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, he set about transforming the aged-care sector with the sector, to lead the way. Those who have come after him, the three ministers in the last five years, have failed older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have always underestimated the level of leadership required to oversee the rollout and implementation of aged-care reforms. Mr Morrison says aged care is a priority, but the portfolio still doesn't have a seat at the cabinet table. The current Minister for Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, has good intentions but has been left screaming from the sidelines to progress the reforms that are needed in the aged-care sector. The pattern is clear: Mr Morrison is following in Mr Turnbull's and Mr Abbott's footsteps and he cannot be trusted with aged care. We are in the midst of an aged-care crisis because of the lack of actions by those on the other side of the chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's call for this royal commission is frankly an admission of failure. They have essentially called a royal commission into themselves because they've been in charge. They've had the responsibility as the government for five years, and we have nothing to show for it except an aged-care sector that is in crisis. They've done nothing but fail older Australians at every turn for the past five years, and now they don't know what to do or how to do it. That's what this royal commission is all about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister must guarantee that: (1) he will not wait for the royal commission to finish before he starts acting on the issues facing the sector now; and (2) that the royal commission examines the impacts of reduced funding through the Aged Care Funding Instrument; the adequacy of short- and long-term funding of the-aged care sector; the challenges around ensuring there is long-term sustainability of the aged-care system; the adequacies of care requirements for residents in aged-care homes; retirement village living arrangements; poor access to aged-care services in regional, rural and remote Australia, including the dislocation of families; improving transparency of information to consumers, their families and carers; the challenges around ensuring there is a viable well-paid and trained work force now and into the future; and reducing stigma for older Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This royal commission cannot become their latest excuse to do nothing. There are about 14 reviews, reports and inquiries still sitting on the minister's desk without action, collecting dust. The government has cherrypicked its way through a number of key reports and reviews, but piecemeal solutions for an aged-care system in a deepening crisis are just not good enough. Older Australians and their families deserve better than this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's lack of response to the dozens of reviews and reports speaks volumes about where they position older Australians on its list of priorities. Take, for example, the interim report from the Senate inquiry into what happened at Oakden in South Australia—the government has had this interim report for almost a year, but has done nothing about it. The committee was presented with overwhelming, heartbreaking reports from families of the poor quality of personal care. The stories and evidence were harrowing and heart-wrenching, and should have been the trigger for the government to take immediate action. Senator Smith, who's in this chamber, was there and heard the same evidence as I did. It was heartbreaking and soul-destroying for those families to have to go through it again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those families have never given up on ensuring that the system is changed—they have been on social media actually commending this government for finally taking some action and calling for this royal commission. But, once again, this government failed to act. It sat on that report. We're at a crucial time in the reform agenda. Older Australians deserve good policies and leadership from government when it counts. After years of inaction, Australia's aged-care system doesn't need more quick fixes from this government; it needs genuine reform backed by real investment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally concerning in the five years of inaction on workforce development, with the exception of scrapping Labor's $1.5 billion Workforce Compact, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have shown a complete lack of commitment to Australia's aged-care workforce. Aged-care workforce development is one of the biggest challenges facing the sector. With the workforce expected to increase by 300 per cent in the next 30 years, we have to get this right. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Disappointingly, despite saying aged care would be a focus of his new government, Mr Morrison has been silent on workforce development and the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce's strategy, which is also sitting on the minister's desk. His silence on this strategy shows his commitment to his policy area will be little better than his Liberal predecessors. The lack of a response on this strategy fits a disturbing pattern of cover-ups and inaction on aged care from successive Liberal governments. If the Morrison government is truly serious about aged care, it will respond to this strategy immediately and commit funding to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's top priority must be a real plan to address the waiting list for home care packages. If today's response by the representing minister in question time was anything to go by, heaven help us all, particularly those on the waiting list. I have spoken about the waiting list all week. There are 108,000 people waiting. That's from the government's own figures. They were released months after the due date, but they are the most accurate that we have. The June figures are now due to be released but, once again, the government are sitting on them, hoping that they can scratch a few names off them. But the figures the minister quoted today were some 74,000. The real figure is 108,000, with 54,000 of those waiting not receiving any support at all from the Commonwealth government. Some 88,000 of those people on that waiting list are living with dementia. I hope the minister is listening to this. The waiting list for home care packages is no longer tolerable. The minister and this government have a history of delaying this important data. As I said, the June 2018 data is now late, so we can only imagine the 108,000 would be somewhere closer to 115,000 by now. What are you trying to hide? Are you going to sit on this data for another three months while you try to reduce the names on the waiting list so it doesn't look so bad?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the government's watch, there are now over 108,000 people who are waiting for home care packages to be able to stay in their own home. This is much better for them as individuals and it's certainly much better for the bottom line of any federal government. These numbers are absolutely shocking; they're appalling. Mr Morrison's aged-care package in the budget was an absolute hoax. It was a joke and it was absolutely inadequate. The waiting list grows by almost 4,000 older Australians in just three months. The 3,500 new home care packages a year you committed in the budget won't come close to keeping pace with the demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has already publicly admitted the government will need to consider other interventions to reduce the waiting list. Now is your chance to live up to your words, Prime Minister, and to do something. Failure to act will only see more and more older people passing away on your watch or going into residential care or acute hospitals while they wait for home care packages. As the list grows longer and longer, fresh stories emerge daily of older Australians waiting years for home care. The average wait time according to the government's data for a level 3 or 4 package is not what the minister today responded to in question time when he was saying there's a three month wait for level 1 or 2. Levels 3 and 4 have a 12 month wait, and we know from those who are contacting our offices that it can be up to 18 months. How can the Prime Minister say it's okay for a 94 year old with high-level needs to be told they'll have to wait years for care? The reality is he probably won't be here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the Prime Minister must rule out cuts to aged care. The latest leak reported earlier this week revealed that the government is considering a further cut to the Aged Care Funding Instrument of up to $5.4 billion. The Prime Minister's response is to bury his head in the sand—'Nothing to see here; move on; business as usual'—while his ship is sinking. This is shameful. The Liberals are too busy fighting amongst themselves, instead of focusing on what matters. The Prime Minister may have changed, but the government is falling apart at the seams; they're self-imploding. And the people of Australia are sick of it. They are sick of this government's deception and dysfunction. They want a government focused on the issues that matter to them, a big one being the aged-care sector in Australia. I see lots of worried faces on the other side of the chamber, and the reason is that they can't stop talking about themselves; they can't stop fighting amongst themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people turned off a long time ago. They've given up on this government because every day they see the chaos that reigns on that side of the chamber. What the Australian people want is a strong government, and I don't believe this government can provide it. They can't provide the security that older Australians need. What we need is an election so that we can elect Bill Shorten. He will have a minister for ageing in the cabinet. He will, as he has already committed to, put dementia and ageing as a national priority. What we need is a minister in cabinet who will argue for older Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="270552" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GICHUHI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I'm here today to contribute to this very important debate. This government, our government, takes aged care as one of its top priorities. There is no doubt that Australia's demography is one of an ageing population. The demand for aged-care services is driven by the size and health of the older population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently over 5.5 million people in this country who will need aged-care services in the next 10 to 20 years. This is what this government is planning about and is funding on. The Australian population is ageing rapidly, with the proportion of people aged 65 years or over in the total population projected to increase from 15.3 per cent in 2017 to 21.8 per cent in 2056, according to the ABS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is very committed to strategically funding this ageing population issue. To accommodate the needs of the rising older population will require a quadrupling of the aged-care workforce by 2050. Our government, this government, is very much aware of the workforce needs. Recent reports on the ageing of baby boomers show that they are eight times more likely to have health problems than the previous generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, this government, is so focused on this issue that it has given it a strategic approach that covers not only the short-term and the medium-term but the long-term needs of older Australians. Currently, the number of people over the age of 65 receiving aged-care services exceeds 1.2 million. Of those, 83 per cent are classified as requiring high-level care needs. This government, our government, has recognised that the systems and priorities of those opposite are not enough to cater for the high needs of this ageing population. An estimated 60 per cent of the residents needing high-level care have dementia, at least 40 per cent suffer from chronic pain, over 50 per cent are incontinent and 45 per cent have a sleeping disorder. This government, our government, is aware of these facts. In light of these statistics, it's clear that aged-care funding remains a key and very critical factor to support the welfare of the most vulnerable people in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that everyone in this chamber agrees that aged care is an issue that hits home for each and every one of us. This should be one of the bipartisan issues. We should come together in a bipartisan fashion and manner to put our heads together and work for all Australians. We all know someone who is receiving some form of aged-care service, whether it is our parents or grandparents. This is not the time to take political capital or capitalise on issues that affect all of us Australians. Old and young: we are all affected by ageing processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly passionate about aged care because I was honoured to look after my grandmother, who still holds a special place in my heart. She was a woman of strength and wisdom and one of my solid rocks that I stood on. I see so many grandmothers on the streets of this country every day, every hour, and we cannot turn a blind eye or take political capital or take advantage to capitalise on an issue that should be one of the most bipartisan issues this parliament has ever handled at such a critical time. I talk about my grandmother because I link my experience with her to the experience of so many families with elderly parents, elderly grandparents, elderly relatives or just elderly neighbours. In Australia, I encountered aged care while training aged-care workers and nurses. I have had the opportunity to look into the eyes of ageing Australians and wonder if we will be able to give them the dignity and respect that I saw with my grandmother. I wonder how they feel. I wonder what they think.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The need to value and look after our seniors is so central to Australia as a civil and noble society. The need for dignity, respect and freedom has to be maintained and preserved, and we can't afford to make political gains and capital and mileage out of our seniors. As a society, we can never forget that older Australians are the people on whose shoulders we stand. We are whom we are today because they worked, they paid taxes and they looked after us when we were younger. Now it is our time to come together in a bipartisan fashion and give back to our seniors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of this, our government, this government, is providing record aged-care funding of $19.8 billion this year. Our government is not—and I repeat 'is not' with 'not' in capital letters—planning any changes that will reduce funding to aged-care services. Annual funding will increase to record levels by $5 billion—yes, $5 billion—over the forward estimates, from $18.6 billion in 2017-18 to $23.6 billion in the 2021-22 financial year. For this government, aged-care spending has increased by more than an average of six per cent each year. That is an average of $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year. Our government is adding an additional 13,500 residential aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places. Since the last budget, this government has been delivering 20,000 new high-level home-care packages to support senior Australians to remain at home longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is doing what it can, what is needed, to support our senior older Australians remain in their homes for as long as they can and for as long as they want. By 2021-22 more than 74,000 high-level home care places will be available, an increase of 86 per cent from 2017-18. Over $100 million investment in mental health services for ageing Australians in the community and in residential care has been provided, consisting of a $20 million trial to improve mental health services for Australians over 75 years of age, and $82.5 million in new mental health services for people with a diagnosed mental disorder living in residential aged-care facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, this government announced an additional $16 million to police the quality in aged-care services and providers. This government is also bringing forward $90 million this financial year to support quality in residential aged care and aged-care capital works in regional, rural and remote Australia. The government is also examining options for a more stable, certain and efficient residential care funding tool to replace the current Aged Care Funding Instrument, which has been recognised by the independent Aged Care Financing Authority as no longer being contemporary and as inefficient, too subjective and lacking stability in outcomes. Development of a new funding tool is being led by the University of Wollongong, who will provide a report to the government by the end of this calendar year. Any new tool adopted by our government will involve a better and more efficient way of allocating the funding pool. Let me reiterate once more that our government is not considering any options that would reduce, in any way, manner, form or shape, the funding pool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to ensuring that Australians in the aged-care system are better cared for. The need to value and look after our seniors is central to any civil and noble society. Their need for dignity, respect and freedom has to be maintained and preserved. We cannot afford to take political gains or political capital from such an issue affecting very vulnerable members of the community. This government knows that our older Australians are the people on whose shoulders we all stand on. This government has demonstrated that senior Australians' needs are a top priority.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I welcome the fact that Senator Polley has raised this very important issue for debate this afternoon. Before I begin my contribution, I would like just to congratulate my two colleagues the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, the Hon. Julie Collins MP, and Senator Polley, for the great job they've done in the area of aged care, holding the government to account and developing our policies, because we need a strong alternative to this government. The government's cuts in recent budgets to the aged-care sector have been cruel and unwarranted, and they need to be looked into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been saying for a long time that the aged-care system is in a state of national crisis. Unfortunately, when the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten, raised the crisis in the sector in parliament earlier this year, the government attacked him and accused him of fearmongering. They even claimed his comments were akin to elder abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians think of our country as a caring nation. We should respect our older Australians for all they have contributed to the nation and all that they contribute still. Sadly, we have seen the concerning images in the recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program, and it is clear—very, very clear—that actions need to be taken. Labor is appalled and angry about the vision and stories that aired during <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like every other Australian that saw that, I was saddened to see the crisis in our nation's aged-care system, particularly the standard of care being delivered in some nursing homes. Australians, across our nation, are genuinely shocked about the abuses that have happened to elderly Australians—beloved elderly family members who deserve quality care. We must give elderly Australians the love, the care and the respect that they so mightily deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes the aged-care royal commission. It is an important instrument that will get to the heart of the issues in the aged-care sector. We're glad that the government has called for one, but it wasn't that long ago that Minister Wyatt and the government were claiming that we didn't need a royal commission. However, just before that episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> was aired, suddenly they were calling for a royal commission. Let me say, that does not absolve the government of their own contribution to this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After five years in government, every one of those people opposite must accept some responsibility for what's happening today in the aged-care system. The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, must take responsibility for much of the crises that we are seeing. As Treasurer of Australia, it was he who was responsible for the cuts of $1.2 billion from the aged-care sector in the 2016-17 budget. This cut to aged care came on top of the almost $500 million from aged-care funding Mr Morrison cut in the 2015 MYEFO. This money was taken out of the aged-care budget and hasn't come back. Although the government keeps disputing the $1.2 billion figure, let me make it clear that it's in the government's own words that we can actually confirm the cut. You only have to look at the budget papers signed off by the current Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. His name is on these papers in black and white. The cuts he's denying can be found on page 101 of the 2016-17 budget paper 2, where it says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will achieve efficiencies of $1.2 billion over four years through changes to the scoring matrix of the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) that determines the level of funding paid to aged care providers. The Government will also reduce indexation of the Complex Health Care component of the ACFI by 50 per cent in 2016<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:MS Mincho;&#xD;&#xA;  ">‑</span>17 and establish a $53.3 million transitional assistance fund to support providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, on the same page, the government states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The savings from this measure will be redirected by the Government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how do you get savings without a cut? Of course at the time of the 2016-17 budget, there were strong voices in the sector opposed to this $1.2 billion cut. Those voices including the AMA, the Aged Care Guild and Catholic Health Australia. At the time, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> reported:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The Turnbull government's $1.2 billion of aged care funding cuts could force smaller providers to close down or sell up and may lower standards of care for the elderly, industry groups warn</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the share market reacted, with the same article stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Investors reacted negatively to the news, sending the shares of listed aged care providers Regis, Japara, and Estia down 6.6 per cent, 3.8 per cent, and 2.6 per cent respectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government cannot rewrite history, no matter how much they would like to and no matter how much they've tried. It's clear that Mr Morrison as Treasurer used aged-care funding to prop up his budget without considering the elder Australians who would be impacted. We have now had five years of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, but when will they start taking responsibility for the outcomes of government? Have they forgotten that they've controlled the Treasury purse strings all this time?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission must examine the impact of the Liberals' years of cuts, because you can't fix aged care by cutting funding to it. It's sadly inevitable that, in some areas, standards in the care of older Australians have begun to slip under the weight of these cuts. This government has failed to take the care of older Australians seriously enough, and you can see that through their ministerial arrangements. The coalition does not have a minister for ageing, and the aged-care portfolio is not even included in the cabinet. And due to their continuous infighting, we have seen three different aged-care ministers across the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments, who have had carriage of the Living Longer Living Better reforms for five years but who have all failed to do little if any reforms across the ageing portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the current minister for aged care, Mr Ken Wyatt, has struggled to progress further reform that is needed in aged care because Mr Morrison, the current PM, appears to view aged-care funding as a commodity to be cut and used elsewhere. There have been several inquiries into the aged-care sector which the government hasn't acted on. More than a dozen reviews, reports and inquiries still sit on the minister's desk without being actioned. They just sit there collecting dust. Maybe they're being used as book ends. Maybe he rests a cup of coffee on them, who knows, but what's happening is they're not being acted on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's cherrypicked its way through a number of key reports and reviews leading to aged-care reform now being piecemeal in nature. The quality standards and reporting system aren't working. There aren't enough aged-care workers and they aren't given enough pay, respect or support. The role of nurses and personal care workers in the care of our older Australians is critical and will only become increasingly important. The number of people aged 85 years is rapidly increasing and it's projected to double by 2032. We'll need to see a tripling of the aged-care workforce in the next 30 years to provide a high standard of living and care for this growing proportion of older Australians. It's predicted that the aged-care workforce requirements will need to increase from around 366,000 currently to around one million people in 2050. It is clear that the government's got to ensure that we have an adequately skilled and equipped aged-care workforce to care for our rapidly ageing population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The savage cuts hit older Australians in residential aged-care facilities the hardest, with a 50 per cent cut to the indexation of complex health care subsidies. Prime Minister Morrison and the Liberals cannot be trusted to ensure that older Australians get the aged-care services that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Outside of residential aged care, we also have the majority of older Australians who are receiving care in their homes. This is another area that's been mismanaged by the government—the home care package waitlist. The government has a history of delaying reporting on this important data. The March 2018 quarter was delayed by three months and the June 2018 data is now late, even after the minister committed to releasing this data on time. They're just sitting on the data, and I'm not sure why. I have to ask: why are they just sitting on that data? Is it something that they don't want us to see? Whatever the reason, it's completely unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the government's watch there are now more than 108,000 people on the home care package waiting list, including 88,000 people with high needs, many of whom are living with dementia. Around 54,000 of these older Australians who are waiting have no home care package at all. Those are 54,000 Australians who are not getting the support they need to shower and get ready in the morning or with cleaning around their homes or with any number of issues. That support could make life just a little bit easier for them. Those are 54,000 Australians who do not receive the dignity or live with the dignity that they deserve. We should judge ourselves as a nation by how we treat our elderly. How can the government say it's treating older Australians with dignity when more than 100,000 of them are waiting for care? Labor's called on the government time and time again to fix this crisis but, like the 108,000 older Australians, we're still waiting for action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in question time I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care, Senator Scullion, three simple questions. These questions were very straightforward: how many older Australians are currently on the government's home care package waitlist; how many older Australians currently on the government's home care package waitlist are receiving no home care package at all; and how long are some older Australians being forced to wait for their approved package level or, worse still, are without any home care package at all? I was hugely disappointed by Minister Scullion's answers to my questions on this issue—hugely disappointed!—because he just made motherhood statements about keeping senior Australians in their homes, and his answers, when he finally got to some numbers, used outdated data to try and understate the demand. He wouldn't even use an accurate figure. He used a figure from 31 December 2017, almost nine months out of date, when his own minister had used the 108,000 figure earlier. That's the government's own number. That's Minister Wyatt's own number, and Minister Scullion couldn't use it. They were absolutely shameful and disastrous answers to three very simple questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we had Minister Canavan arguing that asking for this information in question time shouldn't even be allowed—seriously!—and that the minister shouldn't even be expected to answer any question that involves statistics. It was utterly unbelievable, but I know why Senator Canavan did that. He did it because he was trying to save Minister Scullion from his own ineptitude and the rest of the nation from seeing it. If the minister isn't able to answer a basic question, maybe he should consider a different career choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs a national dementia strategy to help it deal with the growing toll that this disease is taking on senior Australians. Many older Australians living in aged-care facilities have dementia, and they're simply not getting the high level of care that they need. A very dear friend of mine recently spent her final weeks and months living with dementia in an aged-care facility. Over the past few years and months, I've seen a lot of what happens in this area. I've seen the limitations of staff. I've seen that staff aren't able to take the time they would like to care for their clients. I've seen the understaffing and overworking of the carers and staff who are doing their very, very best under huge pressure to save both time and money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't wait for the results of the royal commission to start undertaking important reforms. They have to start now. The quality standards and the reporting system aren't working. There aren't enough aged-care workers, as I have said before—and I gave the numbers earlier about how much the system needs to grow because we've got such an ageing population. They aren't given enough pay, respect or support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just earlier this week, I met with representatives from the Health and Community Services Union who cover workers in this area in Tasmania. Their members are passionate about providing high-quality care for the senior Australians that they look after. Can you imagine though how hurt these members were when former Prime Minister Turnbull told them to get a better job. That tells us what this government thinks about aged-care workers and aged care in general. No wonder the sector's in crisis, if this is the attitude of the government towards workers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The union and their members are extremely concerned about the crisis the aged-care sector is in because, unfortunately, not all operators do the right thing by their clients or their staff. The union emphasised to me just the other day the need for accredited training and increasing the size of the workforce. We also need to ensure workers get appropriate levels of pay which will drive professionalism in the industry and give workers the security to make major decisions and to stay in the industry. It's not good enough to tell aged-care workers to get a better job. They already have a good job; they just need to be recognised for it and provided with the resources they need to be able to do it well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the Prime Minister has been the architect of cuts that have gutted aged care and put the sector under immense pressure. We're in the midst of an aged-care crisis because of the actions, and the lack of actions, by those on the other side of the chamber. And when the now Prime Minister cut $1.2 billion from the funding for people with complex and higher needs in the 2016 budget that actually contributed dramatically to the problems in the system. The Prime Minister must take responsibility. He cannot pretend his cuts as Treasurer were nothing to do with him or that they had no impact. He cannot keep misleading people. The cuts were in his own budget papers, and the stakeholders reacted to the cuts at the time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission must investigate the impact of the Prime Minister's cuts to the sector when he was Treasurer. The government must not exclude their cuts from the royal commission's terms of reference and hide from the responsibility that will lie at their feet. So, while the chaotic and divided Liberals have fought amongst themselves, the care of older Australians has been sadly neglected. We must fix this crisis now, because it would be a great injustice to our vulnerable senior Australians to do otherwise.</span>

                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  I'm delighted the Labor Party have raised this matter for debate because it allows me to, first of all, congratulate all of those community and other aged-care facilities that do such a wonderful job for our older Australians. It allows me to recognise carers in aged-care facilities and those who help with home help, and I congratulate them on the wonderful work they do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This also allows me to talk about the bill coming before the parliament in the not too distant future, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill. It allows me to talk about the royal commission into aged-care issues that's been announced by our government and it also allows me to remind older Australians about the 'granny tax', as it's called, that the Labor Party propose imposing upon older people. It allows me to talk about the abolition of franking credits, which impact very, very considerably on the incomes of older Australians who are self-funded retirees and who have shares that they get a small income from. They depend on those franking credits, which the Labor Party propose to take away from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think older people well recognise that, from the days when Liberal governments first introduced the age pension to Australia many, many decades ago, it is the Liberal and National parties that have done more for older people and continue to do so. That is because we want to help people who've made a major contribution to our country over many years. We want to reward those who've done such sterling work for our country during their working lives and who now are entitled to their senior years in good care and condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak with a little authority. My late sister was in an aged-care facility for a number of years in my home town of Ayr, in a facility that was run by the community funded Lower Burdekin Home for the Aged. My mother was there several decades ago, and I still remember the care she got there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have an older sister who receives home care, and I'm conscious of what she receives, and my brother-in-law also receives home care. Whilst at times he has some complaints about the service, by and large he recognises—as I recognise and everyone recognises—that it's a wonderful service, supported by the government, which allows people to stay in their homes longer than would have been the case in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A niece of mine actually works in an aged-care facility. I know what a wonderful, caring person she is, and she tells me often about the great experience it is—how it is not just a job but helping people. Most of the staff at the facility have that experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also quite well familiar with the Bowen Old People's Home Society, who over the years have provided a wonderful service for that community. Again it's a community run and community funded organisation, with some help from the federal government. I know the one in my own home town. I know the Good Shepherd Home, in Townsville, which does wonderful work there. I know the facility in Ingham. I have had a bit to do with the facility in Tully, further north, and in Innisfail—a great organisation which was the recipient of quite substantial federal government assistance just recently. I'm even conscious of smaller communities to the west of Townsville, out towards Mount Isa, smaller towns whose councils have done wonderful work in providing aged-care facilities—on a very limited status, I might say—to their residents so that those residents don't have to leave the community they've lived in all their lives and go into one of the bigger cities to get care in their advancing years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've certainly heard stories of some problems at times, but by and large these facilities, particularly those I mentioned but facilities everywhere, do a wonderful job looking after older people. We should recognise the work that is done and thank those who are involved in that particular line of business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the Labor Party's approach in getting rid of franking credits would have a huge impact on older people. I'm not quite sure where Labor's current policy is. It changes every day or so, depending on what's popular today and what's not popular. I understand they made some changes to it, but that doesn't address the real problem that the Labor Party's policy of taxing older people has evolved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do have some more specific points I want to make, but before doing that can I just respond to the previous speaker. I thought her lettuce-leaf style attack on Senator Scullion in this chamber was most disingenuous. She was asking Senator Scullion—who is not the minister for aged care; he represents the minister for aged care—detailed questions about statistics, and she took umbrage at the fact that he didn't immediately have those in his head. Had the question been on Indigenous affairs, on which he is the expert, I'm sure he would have had all of the figures and statistics and the policies and approaches at the front of his mind. But, as he represents the minister for aged care and a number of other ministers, I'm not surprised that he didn't have these detailed, estimates-type questions immediately to mind. As it's turned out from the speech that Senator Bilyk just gave, she had the information anyhow. It amazes me that she was wasting question time asking Senator Scullion for numbers and statistics which she already had. Clearly the Labor Party have very little to ask about and are just filling in time at question time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was amused that a previous Labor speaker spoke about how we, being the government, were concentrating on internal matters of our party, when, except for today, every question asked by the Labor Party at question time this week has not been about jobs, aged care, the economy, workers or infrastructure; they've all been about the Liberal Party. And the Labor Party have the gall in this debate to attack us for looking inwardly at ourselves, when their complete focus this week has been on anything but the issues that are of importance to Australians!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The home care industry has over the years had some problems—as I say, in the minority of cases. But, as a result, our government set up an inquiry into that. We got Ms Kate Carnell, a well-known public figure and former Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, and Professor Ron Paterson to have a look at the industry and make recommendations about what needs to be done. As a result of the recommendations of the Carnell-Paterson review, the government made some announcements in the 2018-19 budget to establish a new commission from 1 January 2019, and that is what is dealt with in the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill, which I understand has been introduced into the other place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission brings together the functions of the Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. Further work will be undertaken next year to bring the aged-care regulatory functions of the Department of Health into the commission from 1 January 2020. This reform is part of a two-year agenda to strengthen and enhance the care regulation to protect and assure the quality of care provided to aged-care consumers. Consumers, of course, are at the heart of the reforms, and the commission's objectives will be to protect and enhance the safety, health and wellbeing, and quality of life of aged-care consumers to promote confidence and trust in the provision of aged care and to promote engagement with aged-care consumers about the quality and care of services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner will take on the functions currently performed by the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner and the CEO of the Aged Care Quality Agency, with specific functions that also set out and relate to engaging with aged-care consumers in developing and promoting best-practice models for engagement and providers, and also seeking and receiving clinical advice in relation to the functions of the commissioner, which is envisaged to occur through the engagement of the Chief Clinical Adviser, with an expert clinical panel to be established to support the Chief Clinical Advisor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On aged-care funding reform, the Labor Party, in speeches in this chamber during the week, have clearly showed that, regrettably, they cannot even understand the budget papers. In spite of valiant efforts by various ministers during the week to explain this to Labor Party people, it's clear that they don't know how to pick up one of the budget documents and actually read it. If they did that, they would see that the facts of the matter—not their political misinformation campaign but the facts of the matter—are that annual funding will increase to record levels by $5 billion over the forward estimates, going up from $18.6 billion in the current financial year to $23.6 billion in the 2021-22 financial year. Our government is providing record aged-care funding of almost $20 billion this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each year during the term of coalition governments. That is, on average, $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year. We're adding an additional 13,500 residential aged-care places and another 775 short-term restorative places. Based on the latest data, in the current financial year the average Australian government payment, that is subsidy plus supplements, for a permanent resident in residential care was $66,000 per resident. This compares with $53,100 in 2012-13, which listeners might recall was Labor's last full financial year. This is an increase of $12,900 per resident, or a 24.3 per cent increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I emphasise again that these are the facts. Labor, unfortunately, as I said, can't read the budget papers. They don't really understand what they say. But anyone listening to this debate, and I'm sure there are a lot of people in the chamber and around Australia who would be interested in this subject, will well remember the Labor approach to figures and benefits that coalition governments give. The Labor approach is: tell any lie you like and make up any story you like; say it often enough and advertise it often enough, and hopefully the public will believe it. You've got to look no further than the last federal election where the Labor Party invented this 'Mediscare' campaign, where one of the bright sparks in the back room said: 'Let's go out and say the government's going to sell Medicare and privatise Medicare. Let's do that. That should get a headline.' They made a major campaign on that falsity. There was not a skerrick of truth in it, as evidence subsequently showed and as we tried to say at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party work on the proposition that you can tell any lie at all and that if you say it often enough then enough people might believe it, might agree with it, and change their vote at election time and perhaps change the government. That's what the Labor Party is doing with these aged care attacks. They're not supported by facts. The facts are as I've given them and as my colleague Senator Gichuhi clearly enumerated in the wonderful address she gave to the chamber. I'm sure my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells will also elaborate on the facts and figures of the good things that the government is doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my remarks by saying I'm delighted to take part in the debate. It does allow us to highlight the good things our government has done. It does also allow us to clearly demonstrate that Labor has no interest in older people except for how they can tax them to bring in more revenue for the crazy schemes that the Labor Party come up with at election time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  I'll start by saying that it's good that Senator Polley has brought this notice of motion on aged care because it does afford me the opportunity to go back in history and put on record, Senator Macdonald, some additional facts—most especially going back to when Labor was in power and what they actually did in the aged-care space. At the 2010 election, then Prime Minister Gillard said that if she was re-elected then aged-care reform would be her second term priority. Of course, during the 2007-2013 term, Labor presided over 20 reviews and inquiries into aged care and ageing issues, including three by the Productivity Commission. Like many of the Gillard government's goals, this was yet another empty statement masked as an achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated, there were all these reviews when Labor were in government. One of these reviews was, very importantly, the landmark report of the Productivity Commission, which was delivered in 2011. It was a two-volume report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Caring for older Australians</span>. At that time, as shadow minister for ageing and for mental health, it was certainly a document that I was very familiar with. Senator Polley comes in here and says, 'Those opposite haven't responded to the latest inquiry.' Let me remind the chamber that it took the Gillard government over 250 days to respond to the 58 recommendations within the Productivity Commission's landmark 2011 report. That response took the form of a $3.7 billion package over five years—of which, can I just underline, less than $580 million was new money. Of course, like most things that those opposite do, the package was announced in April 2012 and it represented an assortment of cherrypicked recommendations with lots of political spin. You can't have a Labor announcement without lots of political spin, can you, Senator Macdonald?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting</span>—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="e4t" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:</span>
                  </a>  Of course, there was myriad fine print that the stakeholders started to understand only after the election. This report was comprehensive and it looked at and recommended a total overhaul of the system. It referred to the structural changes that were going to be needed to meet the needs of our ageing population into the future, and it talked about an ageing population—a significant increase in the number of older people. It talked about the increasing incidence of age related disability and disease, especially dementia. It looked into the rising expectations about the type and flexibility of care that was being received. It looked at community concerns about variability in the quality of care. It looked at the relative decline in the number of informal carers and, most importantly, it looked at the need for significantly more nurses and personal care workers with enhanced skills, such was the breadth of this report. As I said, in the end, all those opposite did was cherry-pick this report and, may I say, not very successfully.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was clear from their much-lauded Living Longer Living Better package was that everyone except full-paying pensioners would pay more for their care. At the time, we did not oppose this package but, in the end, what we are seeing is that, today, we are now paying the price of this policy and the failure of those opposite to take the necessary reform that they should have taken when they were given this opportunity. Of course, whilst we saw that packages were increased, nevertheless, it came at a price. We saw fees capped. We saw fees increased. Also, there was means testing for the cost of residential care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Polley also asserted that we failed to look at retirement living. I would remind Senator Polley that retirement villages are actually under the auspices of state governments. They're not under the auspices of the federal government. If I recall my consultation with the sector at the time, I believe that there's actually been work done on this at the federal-state level and there is no appetite for retirement villages to be regulated by the Commonwealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I came, and have come, to this area with experience. At age 23, I was the founding board director of an aged-care facility in Wollongong. As I said, I was the shadow minister before the 2013 election. During my time as shadow minister, there were about 2,400 aged-care facilities in Australia at that time and I visited almost a third of those aged-care facilities. There is an overwhelming number of very, very good aged care-facilities in this country. Often you would walk into an aged-care facility and externally it may not be the most luxurious place, but what is vitally important in any aged-care facility is the level of care. It is the attention to the care needs of our older Australians that makes that place a very good aged-care facility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father also had dementia and, unfortunately, lost his battle with dementia. My mother is in an aged-care facility at the moment. In any discussion about aged care and aged-care reform, one has to take into account the changing cultural diversity of Australia. One of the things that has always been very dear to my heart is to ensure the care of our older Australians from culturally diverse backgrounds, especially those who get dementia. Often older Australians lose whatever English language they had and revert not just to their language of origin but, in many cases, to their dialect of origin, and that creates complications. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why have I gone through this? I have gone through this because, going back to the 2013 election when those opposite say that they undertook massive reform of the aged-care sector, we, at that time, understood the important work that the Productivity Commission had undertaken and our 2013 election policy took into account the Productivity Commission report and its implementation. That meant the system needed a major overhaul, not just tinkering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to commend Minister Wyatt for the work he has done. He is certainly moving in this direction. There is, of course, more work to be done. But what is really important is the political will. It's all very well for those opposite to come in here and bleat about the need for reform, but any reform in this area needs to have strong bipartisan support, because you need political will to undertake this reform. We cannot have those opposite saying that they want reform but then, all of a sudden, when you do put forward propositions—which at times may be difficult—doing what they usually do, and that is politicise and scaremonger in relation to these issues, as they have done in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me look at some of the issues. As has been said, annual funding will increase to record levels—by $5 billion over the forward estimates—from $18.6 billion in 2017-18 to $23.6 billion in 2021-22. We are providing record aged-care funding of almost $20 billion this year. Aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each year. That is, on average, $1 billion of extra support for our older Australians each year. We are also adding an additional 13,500 residential aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places. Since the last budget we are delivering 20,000 new high-level home care packages to support our older Australians to remain at home, and by 2021-22 over 74,000 high-level home care places will be available. That is an increase of 86 per cent on 2017-18. Also important is our investment in the mental health services of our older Australians in the community and in residential aged care to improve mental health services, especially for our older Australians who are aged 75 years and over, and provide new mental health services in residential aged-care facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is also necessary to police quality care in our aged-care system. We are also bringing forward $90 million this financial year to support quality in residential aged care and aged-care capital works in regional, rural and remote Australia. We are also examining options for a more stable, certain and efficient residential care funding tool to replace the current Aged Care Funding Instrument, which has been recognised by the independent Aged Care Financing Authority as no longer being contemporary—as being inefficient, too subjective and lacking the necessary stability in achieving outcomes. The development of the new funding tool is being led by the University of Wollongong—of which I am very proud; Wollongong having been where I was born and raised and where my electorate office is at the moment. The University of Wollongong will provide a report to the government by the end of this calendar year. Of course, any new tool that is adopted by the government will, of necessity, involve a better and more efficient way of allocating the funding pool. We are not considering any options that would reduce the funding pool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to move to the specifics of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill, which contributes to our government's commitment to ensure that our older Australians in aged care will be better cared for. This bill gives effect to the government's announcement in the 2018-19 budget to establish the new commission from 1 January next year, as part of providing for better quality of care for consumers of aged-care services in Australia. At this point, I would like to pick up on a comment that Senator Bilyk made. She said that at the moment the current framework isn't working. I'd remind Senator Bilyk—perhaps she can think back to that time—that the current framework was part of the Rudd so-called health reforms. Remember those reforms that gave us 13 new agencies and a total blowout of bureaucrats? This was one of the agencies that was set up, which was lauded as part of this package that I spoke about before—the Living Longer Living Better package, which was supposed to ensure that this quality in our aged-care services would be maintained. Perhaps I can remind Senator Bilyk: it may not be working, but you set it up and so you do bear some responsibility for the issues that have arisen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this commission is also a direct response to the findings and recommendations of the review of the national aged-care regulatory process, which was undertaken by Kate Carnell and Ron Paterson. This commission will bring together the functions of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner, and further work will be undertaken next year to bring the aged-care regulatory functions of the Department of Health into the commission from 1 January 2020. I have to say at this point, this will rectify some of the major errors that were made by those opposite when they set up these huge bureaucracies. In the end, these bureaucracies were falling over each other and overlapping responsibilities and all we ended up getting were more bureaucrats rather than more effective and efficient services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform is part of a two-year agenda to strengthen and enhance aged-care regulation to protect and ensure the quality of care provided to our older Australians. And of course our older Australians, our consumers in this space, are at the very heart of our reforms. The objectives of the commission are to protect and enhance the safety, health, wellbeing and quality of life of aged-care consumers; to promote confidence and trust in the provision of aged care; and to promote engagement with aged-care consumers about the quality of care and services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commissioner will take on the functions which are currently performed by the complaints commissioner and the chief executive officer of the quality agency, with specific functions also set out that relate to engaging with aged-care consumers in the developing and promotion of best practice models for the engagement of providers; and seeking and receiving clinical advice in relation to the functions of the commissioner, which is envisaged to occur through the engagement of a chief clinical adviser. An expert clinical panel will be established to support the role of the chief clinical advisor. The commissioner will be supported by advice from the Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council. The council will be made up of members with significant expertise in the relevant fields, and they will be empowered to provide the commissioner and the government with advice concerning the functions of the commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 provides for the administrative matters required to transfer the functions and operations of the existing bodies into the new commission. Importantly, this bill provides for the continuation of the appointment of the members of the existing council as members of the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council, and will enable the new council to commence operations immediately. It will provide stability and experience in the advice being provided to the commission and to the government. This forms part of the broader aged-care reform agenda announced in 2018-19, which includes further reforms to improve aged-care regulation and to provide greater transparency of the quality in aged care, which will continue to be implemented in the coming months and years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude with comments in relation to the royal commission. I think the royal commission is important because it will afford people the opportunity to put forward their stories. As I said, the overwhelming majority of aged-care facilities maintain very high standards. We have very dedicated aged-care workers, very dedicated nurses and personal carers that work in this space, and I've had the privilege to meet many of them, particularly at the time when I was the shadow minister in this space. But regrettably, there are instances where standards have fallen—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  Earlier in the week, the parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Indonesia provided its report to the parliament, and I'm delighted this evening just to make some comments with regard to that delegation that I participated in in late July this year. The delegation visited Jakarta from 29 July to 1 August and the province of South Sulawesi from 1 to 4 August. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation's primary objectives were opportunities to strengthen trade, economic cooperation and build cultural relationships through people-to-people links as well as Australia-Indonesia development partnerships for health, education, democratic governance and social inclusion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation was of particular interest to me as a senator for Western Australia and someone who is an enthusiast for the Australia-Indonesia relationship but also because of our close geographical position to Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The visit to Indonesia also reinforced some important observations recently remarked upon by Prime Minister Morrison. He said on his recent visit:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Indonesia's success is our success. But it is bigger than that—it is important to our regional and global economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As the world's third largest democracy. Fourth most populous nation. The home to the largest Muslim population in the world. The prosperity, harmony and success of Indonesia is a 'must' for our shared global future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This delegation visit was not only able to combine my deep interest in advocacy for stronger trade between Western Australia and Indonesia but also provided a deeper appreciation for some of the human rights challenges faced in Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of trade, the delegation had an opportunity to explore agricultural issues important to Western Australia's cattle and wheat exports to Indonesia. It's worth reminding the Senate that Indonesia is Australia's largest market for live cattle, accounting for between 50 per cent to 60 per cent of all cattle exported. The delegation also discussed key issues that would ensure the future sustainability of live agricultural trade with both live cattle importers and Indonesian government officials. And it's worth emphasising that live trade is important to both Indonesia and Australia. Building on this key understanding, our discussions turned to the efforts and difficulties experienced by Indonesia in achieving self-sufficiency in meat production, how price sensitive the Indonesian fresh produce market is, the knock-on effects on imports and other important factors such as pricing in Australia, which can be caused by adverse events such as the drought we're experiencing. We discussed the importance of Australia's wheat exports to Indonesia and visited the third largest wheat mill in Indonesia, the PT Eastern Pearl Flour Mill in Makassar, which is part owned by WA grain cooperative, CBH Group. The operation employs over 600 people and has a combined output of 2,650 tonnes of processed grain per day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The visit came at a significant time in the history of Australia's relationship with Indonesia, taking place just one month before our new Prime Minister, the Hon. Scott Morrison, made his own visit and, in doing so, made the Joint Declaration of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia. It is a strategic partnership built on five pillars: first, enhancing the economic and development partnership between our nations; second, connecting people between our nations; third, securing our national and regional shared interests; fourth, developing deeper marine cooperation; and finally, jointly contributing to the Indo-Pacific's stability and prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This agreement brings significant economic benefits to all Australians. This agreement will allow over 90 per cent of Australian export goods to enter Indonesia either duty free or under significantly improved preferential arrangements by 2020. Indonesia will guarantee the automatic issue of import permits for live cattle, frozen beef, mutton, feed grains, rolled steel coil, citrus products, and potatoes. These highlights are critical as 575,000 live cattle will be duty free in one year. Dairy tariffs will be reduced or removed. Around 455 semi loads of oranges will be duty free in year 1. There will be duty free access every year for enough steel to make 176,000 Colorbond roofs or five Sydney Harbour Bridges and greater opportunities for our tertiary institutions, not only vocational education institutions but—increasingly importantly—our universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Western Australia the upside is tremendous. Western Australian grain growers will be some of the biggest beneficiaries of this agreement. Despite exporting 25 per cent of our total annual wheat exports to Indonesia, Australia doesn't supply any feed wheat to Indonesia. This agreement will allow up to $150 million worth of agricultural feed grains to be supplied to Indonesia duty free, potentially adding up to 25 per cent of the value of wheat exports to Indonesia. This deepening of our trade relationship has been particularly well received by WA farmers and their farming associations in my home state of Western Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to extend my thanks to the officials in the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, particularly for the special efforts they took to introduce into the delegation visit a series of issues much more sensitive to Australia's relationship with Indonesia but very critical in Australia's global efforts to improve the human rights and conditions of people living across our region. As co-chair of the Australian group of Parliamentarians Against the Death Penalty and chair of the Parliamentary Liaison Group for HIV Blood-Borne Viruses and STIs, the opportunity to meet with various civil society groups about these issues was important and enlightening. The meetings gave the delegation an opportunity to highlight Australia's recent and long-standing work in pursuing the global abolition of the death penalty, Australia's strategy for abolition of the death penalty and our commitment to make this issue a focus of our work as a member on the Human Rights Council of the United Nations. In Australia, we recognise that, for some countries, the move towards abolition of the death penalty will be gradual and that a staged, sequenced approach may be the most effective, depending on a particular country's circumstances. This is an important and ongoing dialogue with all of our neighbours across the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Indonesia appeared before the Human Rights Council for its Universal Periodic Review in May 2017. During that review, Australia made a number of recommendations to Indonesia, including that it enhance safeguards on the use of the death penalty, including adequate and early legal representation for cases which could attract the death penalty, nonapplication of the death penalty to those with mental illness, revising the criminal code to accord with relevant international human rights law and obligations, and reinstating a moratorium on the use of the death penalty; finalise the investigation of all human rights cases in Papua; prevent discrimination on any grounds, including sexual orientation and gender identity; and continue efforts to reduce violence against women and girls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that Indonesia is facing a serious challenge regarding efforts to prevent HIV transmission. Immediately prior to our visit, Human Rights Watch highlighted that the marginalisation of Indonesia's LGBTI community was fuelling a HIV epidemic and that HIV rates had increased fivefold since 2007. The prevalence of HIV among gay men in Indonesia surged from five per cent in 2007 to 25 per cent in 2015, despite the government making inroads against the disease in the broader population. From 2008 to 2016, Australia provided $126.5 million to HIV prevention testing and treatment in 14 provinces across Indonesia, including Papua and West Papua. Australia currently provides further funding to HIV in Indonesia through support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria both bilaterally to support Indonesia's Country Coordinating Mechanism and multilaterally through the health strategies branch; and, most recently, to UNAIDS through a $320,000 grant from the health strategies branch in June of this year. These are issues that require careful and considered approaches which Australia may be able to bring the full extent of its own experiences, understanding and success to assist Indonesia in managing this critically important public health issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, may I commend Australia's diplomats in Jakarta and Makassar for their professionalism and remark on the exemplary work they do for our nation. In Jakarta, a special thanks to Ms Kirsten Bishop, the acting minister counsellor for governance and human development; Ms Carly Main, who accompanied us across Indonesia; and the deputy head of mission, Mr Allaster Cox, who kept a watchful eye over the delegation in Jakarta. In Makassar, a special thanks to our consul general, Mr Richard Matthews; our consul, Mr Sean Turner; Mr Aaron Corbett; and Ms Paula Waring from the parliament, who acted as the delegation secretary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be a no more important relationship for Australia than its relationship with Indonesia. It's one that brings significant opportunities. It's also one that brings significant challenges, but, as demonstrated by the new Prime Minister's most recent visit to Indonesia, the future is one of brightness, strength and cooperation, and great shared interest in the peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  The issues I want to talk about today is actually a Western Australian issue. I know it's one that's very close to your heart, Senator Lines, because it is the Alcoa dispute that has been going on in Western Australia and that is now into its 43rd day. You might ask why a Queensland senator would want to talk about this, but this issue and what is occurring in Western Australia at the Alcoa site is something that is being replicated around Australia, and it is something that is of particular concern in Queensland as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this dispute is basically the fact that the company wants to terminate their enterprise bargaining agreement. The devastating impact that that would have on the 1,600 striking workers in Western Australia is that it would basically reduce them back to the standard wage and would really have a massive impact on not only their families but also their ongoing employment. When we look at the way that this is being used, and we've seen examples of this in Queensland as well, it is understandable why workers are starting to stand up and unions are starting to stand up, and it's because they are seeing their conditions being eroded away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at what is happening at Alcoa in Western Australia, the workers aren't demanding massive pay increases. In fact, they've actually accepted a pay freeze. All the workers at Alcoa want is to keep their existing pay and conditions that they have fought for and won over many years, and, importantly, to protect their job security as well. This is something that we, on this side of the chamber, know all too well. So many of the industrial disputes that we are seeing actually go to job security. We know the impact that casualisation can have and the impact that labour hire is having on communities and on families and on their abilities to go about their normal business in the way that Australians are used to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that this isn't the case of a trade union playing hardball. The AWU and the Alcoa workers they represent want to talk. They want to reach an agreement. They want to return to work, but you cannot expect good-faith negotiations to occur while Alcoa are threatening the existing EBA. So they are in a really difficult position where they want to sit down with the company but the company is refusing to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The dispute between the AWU and Alcoa highlights how our current industrial relations system falls well short of community expectations and is fundamentally broken—we can see what's happening in Western Australia and the impact that is having on those 1,600 people and their workers. What is interesting for me, observing this from a Queenslander point of view, is that we can see what is happening in Western Australia and we know that it has happened in Queensland as well, but we also know that, effectively, at the heart of this is a federal government that is allowing these sorts of things to occur and that doesn't see any reason that there needs to be a change in the rules of the industrial relations landscape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Companies basically look to the federal system. They can see that they can exploit it, they can see that they can take advantage of it and they can see that they can use it to get further profits and also drive down the existing wages and conditions of current and future employees. This, I think, is something that is motivating the workers at Alcoa, but it's also motivating other workers across Australia, particularly in Queensland. They know they have to fight to protect what they've got, not necessarily to try and get ahead but to try and protect what they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is where this battle lies between now and the federal election. Effectively, workers across this country want to know that there is someone who is on their side. What is clear is that the current federal government are not on the side of workers. They're not on the side of the workers when it comes to this dispute in Alcoa. They're not on the side of the workers when it comes to the issue of penalty rates. They're not on the side of workers when it comes to the issue of labour hire and how that is being exploited to drive down wages and conditions. What the Australian community knows, and what Australian workers know as well, is that this side of the chamber is on their side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to see that federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has been to visit the workers at Alcoa. I know that other Labor members of parliament have been and visited as well. We've been doing that across the country. We've been doing it in Queensland. Our message is a very simple one: we understand that what you are going through and the impact that it's having on your family is not acceptable. We also understand that you want to know that there is a federal government in Canberra that is on your side. We know what you're going through. We know that you need legislation that will enable you to protect your conditions and protect your wages, but also build on that. Like us in this chamber, wanting to leave a better country behind, you want to leave a better workplace behind. You want to know that those workers who come after you are going to benefit from improved wages and improved conditions that you have built up over time. You can't afford to go backwards, whether it's on wages or whether it's on conditions, particularly for those that have been hard fought like they have at Alcoa and like they have at other companies around Australia through the work of employees and unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to the Alcoa workers is that the federal Labor Party is absolutely on your side. I'm very confident that, if a federal Labor government is to be elected, we will absolutely be on your side. We can absolutely be certain that we will deliver that message to workers across the country between now and the next election, because we understand the issues that you are going through and we understand that you need a federal Labor government that can deliver for you so that you and your family can enjoy a better standard of life.</span>

Sleeping Giants Oz claims to be combatting bigotry, racism and sexism in the media and trying to 'stop hate speech in the media by stopping its ad dollars'. Followers are encouraged to identify 'hate speech' and to send a screenshot of the ad next to the supposedly offending content to the advertiser, copying in Sleeping Giants at the same time—the aim being to discourage advertisers from advertising with that media outlet, often with the threat of consumer boycott. Advertisers have been told to demand their ads not appear on the same or opposite page to any coverage of Pauline Hanson or One Nation—an action claimed to be aimed at stopping racism. The same confused thinking was behind one follower's boycott of liquor shop Dan Murphy's because their ad appeared on the opposite page to a <span style="font-style:italic;">The D</span><span style="font-style:italic;">aily Telegraph</span> column by Miranda Devine. Such actions whip up online vigilantism, with all its potential excesses, in an effort to censor coverage or expression of opposing political views.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sleeping Giants Oz was also active in the same-sex marriage plebiscite, demanding assurances from printing companies that they would not print the elusive 'stop the fags' poster supposedly spied in a Melbourne laneway but believed to be a social media prank by same-sex marriage proponents. But Sleeping Giants' main targets in Australia are Sky News and News Corp more generally, and also 2GB—specifically Alan Jones. Sleeping Giants Oz made clear its intentions in August 2017 when it accused Sky News and the Murdoch print media of whipping up 'hatred and division'. However, last month Sleeping Giants Oz began a concerted campaign against Sky News following an interview on Sky's <span style="font-style:italic;">Adam Giles Show</span> with Australian United Patriots Front founder, Blair Cottrell. Despite Sky News apologising profusely for this interview and notwithstanding Cottrell's previous appearance on Channel 7 and interview by the ABC triple j <span style="font-style:italic;">Hack</span> program, Sleeping Giants Oz unleashed a wave of confected fury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the anonymity of Sleeping Giants' campaigns destroys their credibility. Often, anonymous campaigns like Sleeping Giants have ulterior commercial motives. In the US and Australia, these campaigns appear at first glance to be propagated by advertising industry types with political motivations. In the US, Sleeping Giants began after the 2016 election by targeting the influential Breitbart News, operating entirely anonymously until July 2018, when advertising industry copywriter and registered Democrat Matt Rivitz was outed as the group's founder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason such campaigns crave anonymity is they don't want to be exposed as being politically inspired and, more importantly, they rely on deceiving people—in this case, advertisers—about their real level of support. Here, it's been revealed that a key figure in Sleeping Giants Oz is advertising industry consultant Denise Shrivell, though she describes her involvement as advocacy while the group itself claims she is only 'a dearest friend'. Clearly Ms Shrivell, who regularly posts to Sleeping Giants Oz, is a prime mover in this group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Shrivell runs a consultancy called MediaScope, which is promoted as connecting advertising buyers and advertising sellers within niche, ambient, below-the-line, emerging mobile, digital and independent media platforms. MediaScope produces graphics called MediaScapes, one of which purports to plot Australian media by political complexion as being either progressive, centre or conservative, which is how she categorizes Sky News. She also regularly tweets a list of media of which she approves, including <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Saturday Paper</span>, New Matilda, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Monthly</span>, The New Daily and Independent Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In mid-2016, Denise Shrivell wrote of her recent political awakening, saying: 'Over the last 12 or so months, I've had a political awakening. My husband says it's like I've been born again, and in some ways he's right. I've found my political truth and can finally see the realities of our political and news media landscape. Overall, it's a compelling, sorry story and is something we should all be aware of.' Quite so! Ms Shrivell is active in the North Shore Labor politics. Her Facebook profile page has pictures of her doorknocking for Ms Keneally, now Senator Keneally, in Bennelong. She is obviously untroubled by Senator Keneally's previous association with Sky.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although Sleeping Giants Oz claims to have no political allegiances, on Twitter Shrivell is fanatically pro-Labor and anti-coalition, repeatedly suggesting the country is sliding towards fascism and authoritarianism. It has now emerged that fewer than 200 individual Twitter accounts were responsible for 53 per cent of Sleeping Giants' campaign against Sky News following the Blair Cottrell interview; that as few as 10 of these 200 accounts generated a total of 4,500 tweets in 45 days aimed at advertisers; and that more than 70 per cent of the Twitter accounts are anonymous. Here we have a case study of how anonymous multiple Twitter accounts are used to massively amplify campaigns, in this case targeting advertisers on Sky News. It's simply online astroturfing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sleeping Giants' most prolific anti-Sky News tweeter is an anonymous account which goes by the interesting name What You See Is What You Get. Its blurb says the owner of this account is 'committed to driving all forms of hate speech, including racism and misogyny, out of Oz media'. This account also features a Bitmoji-type avatar of a woman with long blond hair and glasses who could be mistaken for Ms Shrivell herself and who coincidentally happens to share some of her interests and preoccupations. Many times daily, What You See Is What You Get tweets at different advertisers, accusing them of financing or supporting an alleged hideous agenda of racism, misogyny and homophobia in an effort to engage and dissuade them from advertising on Sky News, occasionally even threatening a personal boycott of their product. By comparison, Ms Shrivell's tweets, while supportive of Sleeping Giants, are more circumspect and by and large do not directly criticise individual advertisers. I note she is reported as denying she runs Sleeping Giants Oz or set up its anonymous Twitter accounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would stress that the anonymity of Sleeping Giants' operators and their reliance on anonymous Twitter accounts completely destroys the credibility of their campaigns and, indeed, attracts suspicion about the group's motivation. Advertisers should be aware, particularly in the lead-up to election campaigns, not only that Sleeping Giants Oz engage in multiple anonymous and therefore suspect accounts to amplify its attacks but also that its attacks are politically motivated. Thankfully, most advertisers so far appear not to have been conned by this campaigning. I will have more to say on the deceptiveness— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
