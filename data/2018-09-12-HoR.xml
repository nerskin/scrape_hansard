Police intelligence or observations that a person is behaving suspiciously in the airport—for example, by taking photos or videos of security screening points—will not always meet the current threshold. This is not satisfactory in today's threat environment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That being said, police have no intention of checking the identity of people at random in the airport environment, nor would they have the power to do so under this bill. Rather, police will exercise the new identity checking powers based on clear criteria in the legislation, and relying on their specialist expertise and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the amendments contained in this bill, a person on the premises of a major airport may be issued with a direction to provide evidence of identification only where a constable or AFP protective service officer:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Suspects on reasonable grounds that a person has committed, is committing, or intends to commit an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or a law of a state having a federal aspect, punishable by imprisonment for 12 months or more; or</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Considers on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to give the direction to safeguard aviation security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill will empower police officers to direct that a person leave the aviation environment, or not take a flight, for up to 24 hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new move-on power will only be available to police in a limited range of circumstances, including where it is reasonably necessary to prevent or disrupt serious criminal activity at airports or on a flight, or safeguard aviation security. A person may also be directed to move on where they fail to comply with an identity check or a police direction to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the absence of a Commonwealth power to address security or criminal risks, police at airports may be forced to use move-on directions available in limited circumstances under varying state and territory legislation—leading to an inconsistent approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new move-on power in this bill will ensure police can respond to serious threats that arise in the aviation environment in a more tailored and proportionate way. For example, police may exclude a known member of an outlaw motorcycle gang from the arrivals hall of an airport for a period of two hours, in circumstances where police have intelligence about an incoming flight carrying rival gang members. Issuing a move-on direction in this situation may be necessary to safeguard aviation security and ensure the safety of the travelling public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill will create new criminal offences for failing to comply with an identity check, move-on or stop direction, punishable by a fine of up to $4,200. To ensure there are appropriate safeguards on the use of these powers, the bill will also contain requirements for police officers to comply with certain duties in exercising the new powers—including appropriately identifying themselves and informing a person that failure to comply with a direction may constitute an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A patchwork of Commonwealth, state and territory laws currently apply across Australian airports. The bill will address some of this complexity by giving state and territory police and AFP officers, including protective service officers, consistent and appropriate powers to manage risks that are unique to the aviation environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new powers will be available in all major capital city airports, as well as Gold Coast, Launceston, Alice Springs, Townsville and Cairns airports, and any additional airports that the relevant minister determines should be covered into the future, based on operational advice from the AFP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Risks to aviation security are not static, and our laws shouldn't be either. We need to continue to strengthen our security arrangements to keep ahead of these evolving threats. We do this on the basis of advice from our operational agencies and I thank them sincerely for the work they do to keep the Australian community safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new identity checking and move-on powers are necessary, reasonable and proportionate to the criminal and security risks at airports. Importantly, with this bill, we are striking the right balance between security and minimising disruption to the travelling public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

This bill gives effect to the government's announcement in the 2018-19 budget to establish this new independent commission, as part of providing for better quality of care for consumers of aged-care services in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, we now know what the new Prime Minister really thinks of Tasmanians. We know what he thinks of the Treasurer of Tasmania, but we also know what he thinks of every single Tasmanian. He didn't tell the people of Braddon what he thought of them on his single solitary trip to Tasmania during the by-election campaign. He said nice things about Tasmanians there. But, when he was on the telephone to the Treasurer, in the privacy of his own office, he had a different form of words. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a great deal of respect for the institution and the dignity of the parliament so I am not going to quote the Prime Minister directly—I'm sure you would agree with that decision—I will just say that the language was inappropriate and would be unfit to be mentioned in this House. But the Prime Minister thought it was fit to use that language to the Treasurer of Tasmania. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know why, perhaps, this new Prime Minister has been to Germany more times in his term than he has been to Tasmania. He really thinks that Tasmanians are mendicants, beggars. He thinks that the Tasmanians waiting at Hobart Hospital are beggars. He thinks that Tasmanians who dare to dream of going to the University of Tasmania are beggars. He thinks that those Tasmanians who want a good quality education for their children are beggars. That's what the now Prime Minister thinks of the people of Tasmania. That's what he thinks of the people of the state of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also tells us about the state of the Morrison government. I hazard a guess: I don't think this leak came from the Apple Isle. I think this leak came from the Big Apple. I think the former Prime Minister has worked out that his loyal Treasurer was undermining him the whole time.  He has told us at the dispatch box—we've asked him, 'Why is Malcolm Turnbull no longer the Prime Minister of Australia?' His answer in effect is: 'Well, I don't know, because it wasn't me. I had nothing to do with it. I turned up at the Liberal Party room and the next thing I knew I was Prime Minister of Australia. It was all a big surprise.' His defence is: 'I walked in as the Treasurer; I walked out as Prime Minister and I'm still not quite sure how it happened.' He's got form, of course, because he did it before to Tony Abbott. We know how this bloke operates. But, more importantly, the Liberal Party knows how he operates. What it also means is that this will continue. He says the curtain has come down on the muppet show. Well, it is actually only opening night when it comes to the dysfunction of this government. They are riven with disunity. We are going to see these leaks continue—another day, another leak.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be focused as a parliament. But, while this government should be focused on the needs of Tasmanians, Western Australians, South Australians—goodness knows what he thinks of South Australia if that's what he thinks of Tasmanians—this government are focused on themselves. They are focused on one job and one job alone: trying to save the prime ministership of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve better than this. Tasmanians deserve better than this. They deserve a government focused on low wages growth. They deserve a government focused on economic growth. They deserve a government focused on better funding for schools and hospitals. They deserve a government that is focused on more fairness in our taxation system. They deserve a government focused on the future, not on the past battles within the Liberal Party. They deserve a government which knows who should be the Prime Minister of Australia and that should be the member for Maribyrnong. They deserve a government that knows who should be in the cabinet of Australia and that should be the people chosen by the Labor Party caucus, because we have the vision for Australia and for Australians' needs. We're not interested in the factional fights of the Liberal Party. We're interested in the long-term, best interests of the Australian people. That's the sort of government Australia needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody is suggesting that the challenges facing Australia are easy. I'm not suggesting that the matter of GST distribution is easy. I hazard to say that I understand better than most just what a complicated issue it is. There are legitimate concerns of the people of Tasmania and of the people of Western Australia. These concerns are legitimate. We in the Labor Party have taken the issue seriously. We've spent the time, talking in good faith to our Western Australian colleagues and to our Tasmanian colleagues, working on the issue and coming up with a concrete solution. We've been working with state governments, with the Treasurer of Western Australia, with the shadow Treasurer of Tasmania, and, indeed, with people across the political aisle to find the right solution, because it is a problem, because it is a challenge and because it should be fixed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Tasmania shouldn't pay the price, and nor should the people of Western Australia. The people of Western Australia have a legitimate concern, and the Labor Party has moved to fix it. My point is that we've done so because it's an important issue. We haven't been dragged there because of the political pressure. We haven't tried to come up with a retrofitted solution and, along the way, insulted the Treasurer of one of Australia's states. A Liberal Party Treasurer was insulted by the then Liberal Party federal Treasurer. Goodness know how he talks to Labor Treasurers, Mr Speaker. Goodness knows what he says to Labor Treasurers. There is how he treats his own state Liberal Party Treasurer.</span>

                  </a>  It was a very authentic phone call. I pay respects to the member for Fremantle. It was a very authentic phone call, as we now know. We now know what he really thinks. We now know his true temperament. We now know what really makes him tick when it comes to big issues facing the Australian people. It's all about the politics for this bloke. It is all about the internal Liberal Party politics. You can take him out of the state directorship of the Liberal Party, but you can't take the state directorship of the Liberal Party out of him. He's still, at heart, a state director of the Liberal Party, not a Prime Minister for all Australians. He's certainly not a Prime Minister for all Tasmanians—not for the Treasurer of Tasmania, nor for all Tasmanians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a Prime Minister who is simply not up to the job. He wasn't up to the job of being Treasurer, with all due respect, Mr Speaker, and he's certainly not up to the job of being Prime Minister of Australia. This is a man who thinks it's appropriate to slam down the phone on the Treasurer of Tasmania and use language which was insulting and which I will not repeat in the House. I have too much respect to repeat it in the House. It was clearly insulting to the Treasurer and to all Tasmanians, because that is what he really thinks. He didn't fly into Braddon and say: 'I'm here to tell you you're all mendicants. I'm here to tell you don't deserve the GST money. I'm here to tell you don't deserving fair hospital funding or school funding. I'm here to tell you if you vote for me and for the Liberal Party you'll get a Treasurer and then a Prime Minister who thinks Tasmanians are beggars.' He didn't tell the people of Tasmania that.</span>

He's therefore willing to be dishonest with the people of Australia. He's not very authentic. He knows that if he can fake authenticity, he's got it made. He knows that. That's his big plan. He says he has a mountain to climb to show the Australian people he's authentic. He's right there; we've found a point of agreement. He has a mountain to climb to show the Australian people he is authentic, because he is not authentic. He is authentic about one thing only: his ambitions. Remember when he gave Malcolm the cuddle and said, 'This is my leader and I'm ambitious for him.' Well, he was ambitious for somebody; that's true. He's not ambitious for the people of Tasmania, that's for certain. He thinks the people of Tasmania deserve less. He thought Malcolm Turnbull should deserve less as well, and he dealt with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not let him deal with the people of Tasmania. Let's not let him deal with the matter of GST distribution. Let's not let him deal with low wages growth in Australia, where his plan is to cut penalty rates. Let's not let him deal with underfunding of schools, where his plan is to cut school funding more. Let's not let him deal with underfunding of hospitals and hospital cuts. Let's not let him deal with the challenges facing Australians doing it tough, trying to make ends meet, who commit no crime other than working on weekends, only to get a wages cut; or Australians who want their schools and hospitals properly funded. He has no plan for them. He probably thinks they're beggars and mendicants as well. He thinks they're an irritant as he tries to climb the mountain to build his authenticity, as he tries to show the Australian people he is really just an ordinary bloke. Well, he is an ordinary bloke with bad plans for Australia. He is a very ordinary Prime Minister—I'll give him that. He is a very, very ordinary Prime Minister. This bloke is the most ordinary Prime Minister since Billy McMahon. I suspect the Australian people will work that out, and they will work out his lack of authenticity as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:59</span>):  The motion is seconded. Tasmanians are rightly outraged as they pick up their newspaper today and see reports about the conversation between the Treasurer of Tasmania and the now Prime Minister. Tasmanians have allegedly been called beggars by the Prime Minister. Tasmanians who are queuing up in our hospitals and are currently ramped in an ambulance at the Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmanians who are seeking mental health services at the Launceston General Hospital, and Tasmanians who are trying to access specialists on our north-west and west coasts are beggars, according to the Prime Minister. They're not Australians trying to seek the same health services as every other Australian, according to our Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an outrageous slur on Tasmanians and it goes to the character of this Prime Minister. It goes to the character of this Prime Minister that he will, behind closed doors, say things like this about Tasmania and Tasmanians and show such complete disregard for Tasmania in a private conversation that clearly happened, because the Treasurer of Tasmania, one of his friends, hasn't denied this conversation happened. All he's denied are the actual words. Clearly there was a very heated conversation and clearly a conversation took place where the current Prime Minister allegedly called Tasmanians beggars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister really needs to come to Tasmania. He's been down once, as we heard from the shadow Treasurer. He's been down just once in the last three years in his term, and it's only because of the Braddon by-election that he come down. In fact, his trip was so quick, I actually missed it. He just flew in and flew out and nobody really noticed he was there. That's because he doesn't actually care about Tasmania, and that is apparent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also very clear, unfortunately, that the Tasmanian Liberals have no influence here in Canberra and that the federal Liberal Party is not taking the Tasmanian Liberals seriously, whether it be the Senate team or whether it be the Liberal state government. This does not bode well for Tasmania. It does not bode well for Tasmania in GST discussions, it does not bode well for Tasmania when it comes to funding our education system, it does not bode well for Tasmania when it comes to health funding and it does not bode well at all for Tasmanians who expect the Prime Minister to treat us like every other Australian—to treat us the same as he treats his friends at Cronulla.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an outrageous slur against Tasmanians, and Tasmanians actually deserve an apology from this Prime Minister for speaking like that to the Treasurer of Tasmania, who is supposed to be his friend. You can imagine the muppet show over there—who's friends with whom? They go over here, they do a little dance and a little show and they try and pretend they're authentic. They try and pretend that they like Tasmanians when they come down. It is outrageous what is going on over on that side—the disunity and the dysfunction from this government continues with this leak. It is outrageous that they would say such things about Tasmanians. But, as I said, it really does go to the character of our Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Prime Minister should be prepared, in a phone call with the state Treasurer, to discuss a serious issue like GST funding, which Tasmanians rely on more than most states to fund essential services. This is a very serious issue. We talk about the muppet show and dysfunction and chaos, but Tasmanians actually need these funds. Tasmanians actually rely on them to fund our essential services. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to have this conversation in private and to say things that clearly happened in this conversation that implied Tasmanians are beggars. We should not have to put up with this. It is not okay that this has happened, and the Prime Minister really does need to say to Tasmanians: 'I'm sorry for what I've said. I'm sorry I've been caught out. I'm sorry that this has occurred.' He needs to say 'I'm sorry' to Tasmanians for this conversation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the Treasurer of Tasmania, as I said, has not denied that a conversation occurred is actually damning on the Prime Minister. The fact that he has not said that there was not a heated conversation is damning of this Prime Minister. But, as we heard from the shadow Treasurer, we expect these leaks to continue because we know that they are still not united on that side. We know that they still don't trust each other. That is clearly apparent. We know that the disunity, the dysfunction and the chaos on that side of politics is going to continue, and it will continue to the detriment of Tasmanians and it will continue to the detriment, I'm sure, of other Australians. But this Prime Minister should actually come in here, say sorry and start treating Tasmanians the same as every other Australian. This has been an outrageous slur and he should fix it.</span>

                  </a>  I think this demonstrates what this motion is all about: it's a cheap stunt. The opposition are not focused on the Australian people. The shadow Treasurer was talking about the need to focus on the Australian people. Look at you all. Are you doing that? No. What is the Prime Minister doing? He is focusing on the Australian people because he knows that's what his job is. From day one, from the day he was given the great honour of being Prime Minister of this country, he has had nothing but focus on delivering for the Australian people. I know that this might be concerning and alarming for those opposite because they don't do that. They do not focus on the Australian people like we do. What are we focused on doing? We're focused on delivering a strong economy, we're focused on delivering a safe Australia and we're focused on making sure that that strong economy delivers the essential services that the Australian people need. That is what we are all about on this side. What are you on about over there? You're on about coming in here with your cheap stunts—</span>

                  </a>  What those opposite are focused on are cheap political stunts. They're not focused on the Australian people, like the Prime Minister is. They're not focused on delivering outcomes. Let's remember the outcome that the Prime Minister did deliver when it came to the GST. There was a problem which Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania said needed to be fixed in a way that dealt with them fairly. What the then Treasurer did was come up with a solution. What we haven't heard from those opposite is what they will do. What will they do to fix it? What's their solution? Nothing. That's why they come in here with these cheap political stunts. To those opposite: you're not focused on delivering outcomes for the Australian people. You're not focused on making sure that they have improved lives into the future. All you're worried about is coming in here and using some allegation from some report to try and say, 'Okay, there is something here that the Australian people need to be focused on.' We're not going to play your games. We are going to make sure that we are delivering for the Australian people, and that is what we will continue to do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what we are doing. One thousand jobs a day are being created. Just think for a minute about what that does for people's lives: the fact that we can create 1,000 jobs a day. That is transformational for those people who are getting those jobs. You should be applauding that. You should be applauding the fact that, right now, we have record jobs growth in this country. You should be backing the policies that are delivering that record jobs growth. You should be backing the policies that have delivered income tax cuts. You should be backing the policies which have seen small business tax reduced. That is what we're about. Why don't we hear more from you about that? Those are the sorts of policies which change people's lives. </span>

Look at those medicines that we've been able to provide cheaply to the Australian people. We in this place all know that that delivers real outcomes for those people who need those medications. We're able to do that while we're still keeping the budget heading back to surplus. When was the last time those opposite delivered a surplus? I can't remember. We've lost Wyatt Roy in this place, and I can't remember now the last time that they delivered a surplus. We are delivering these essential services in a way which is economically affordable.</span>

We're delivering funding for schools, we're delivering better health outcomes and we're delivering jobs outcomes. That is incredibly important for those Tasmanians, and we will continue to deliver that. That is incredibly important. While I'm here, just so we can really put paid to what this motion is all about, I'd like to read out a statement from the Tasmanian Treasurer.

                  </a>  I now wish to table the parliamentary delegation report on the Indonesian visit of 29 July to 4 August. The members of the delegation were Ms Sharon Claydon MP, member for Newcastle; Senator Patrick Dodson, senator for Western Australia; Senator Dean Smith, senator for Western Australia; Ms Paula Waring, delegation secretary; and myself, Ken O'Dowd, member for Flynn and leader of the delegation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indonesia has a current population of 262 million and it's growing at five million a year. It's a nation made up of 17,000 islands. Unfortunately, there are still many people living below the poverty line and surviving on less than $5 a day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very interesting to learn that people from the South Sulawesi islands had been sailing in their boats—seven sails—on the monsoon winds to northern Australia and Arnhem Land. This practice continued over many centuries, and their relationship with the Australian Aboriginals was great, as they exchanged culture and traded their wares.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank all members of the delegation for their time, contributions and participation in the very busy week—first in the west in Jakarta and then in the east at Makassar in South Sulawesi. I would also like to thank the ambassador, His Excellency Gary Quinlan; the deputy ambassador, Allaster Cox; Consul-General Richard Matthews; and their staff. They gave us a very warm welcome and extended their hospitality to the people of Indonesia, cultivating of goodwill, ensuring the visit was very well organised and making the delegation to Indonesia informative and a learning and sharing experience for us all.</span>

                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  by leave—Thank you to the leader of our delegation, the member for Flynn, for those comments just now. I too would like to acknowledge a number of people who really made our delegation trip across to Jakarta and to South Sulawesi the very best it could be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to, in these few moments, focus on a couple of matters that the member for Flynn wasn't able to cover. My focus is really on the efforts that Indonesians are making to reduce poverty within its peoples, indeed with a very strong focus on the elderly, women and children. There were some terrific programs that we got to visit. We got to see firsthand and talk to people about the significant impact being made. I don't think anyone should underestimate the task of trying to reduce poverty in Indonesia, although there have been, really, a lot of very substantial gains made. There are still 26 million people living below the national poverty line and another 62 million Indonesians considered to be economically vulnerable, so there is an enormous task ahead, but the government and communities within Indonesia are making every effort to address this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We got to see terrific efforts being made around urban sanitation programs. That was a very important partnership with Australia. There was some $200,000 of development money from the Australian government to provide 400 households living in a very densely populated urban slum area outside Jakarta with septic and sewerage systems. Of course, that's important to not only the health and wellbeing of all the people living in that urban area but also the health and wellbeing of the river system, which is where all of that raw sewerage had been going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to flag some terrific conversations that we had around Indonesian efforts to look after older people in poverty in their communities and some very early discussions we had around whether Indonesia might be able to examine something on par with an age pension system. These are very early discussions—people are very interested; it's obviously a very big financial cost for the Indonesian government—but it was terrific being able to have those discussions with the Australian delegation, because we've had an age pension system in Australia pretty much since Federation. We were almost one of the earliest governments to do so. I hope that those discussions continue. There was terrific presence from all of the Australian embassy's DFAT staff there in helping to coordinate those discussions with many of the not-for-profit and community organisations in Jakarta that are interested in reducing poverty amongst the elderly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to make a very quick reference to the issue of asbestos related health issues in Indonesia. We had an opportunity to meet with a local group called LION, which is an acronym that stands for Local Initiative for OHS—occupational safety and health—Network. They are pushing up against it at the moment. There is such a lack of information within Indonesia with regard to the dangers of asbestos. There is often a misdiagnosis of asbestos related lung conditions within the medical profession there. There has only ever been one asbestos disease inquiry compensation case that has been successful in Indonesia. This is a product that we have rightly banned in this country, but there is continued importation of raw asbestos from both Russia and China into Indonesia. It is prolific in the manufacturing of all roofing materials in Indonesia, so people are working on these asbestos-riddled projects. These roofs are being used in schools, hospitals and all sorts of residential housing. It is potentially an enormous issue going into the future for Indonesia. I thank LION, who are a very small group of profoundly dedicated people trying to organise within the workforces there and their communities to get information out about the dangers of asbestos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank APHEDA, the Australian People for Health, Education and Development Abroad, who put me in touch with LION, and the delegation for accompanying me. We had some terrific news that Australian government funded projects in Indonesia have asked for the prohibition of asbestos in any projects that we are funding, which is a good leadership role for the Australian government to be taking. The delegation strongly endorses Australia continuing to stipulate that we will not allow asbestos to be used on Australian government funded projects within Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to end with terrific thanks to the women of Indonesia, who showed me such determination for themselves to get better representation in parliaments throughout Indonesia. The representation of women in parliaments is a topical issue even here in Australia. We had some very good, robust discussions about how they might best do that. I thank those women, who are trailblazers in Indonesia, for achieving gender equality and women's empowerment in Indonesia. There were some terrific and indeed formidable women parliamentarians who we did get to meet. I extend my best wishes to them, and hopefully we'll be seeing many, many more of them elected in the not-too-distant future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we went to Makassar, and I thank the member for Flynn for reminding the House of the incredibly important historical links between Makassan traders and the First Nation peoples of Australia in North Australia. It was a real honour to be there with Senator Pat Dodson, who was able to trace Makassan links through to the Kimberley region and, indeed, to some parts of his family. It was a real privilege to see those ancient people-to-people links continuing into our contemporary worlds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former anthropologist, I was really delighted to be able to attend a very important rock art site just out of Makassar, at the time under the leadership of Associate Professor Adam Brumm, from Griffith University. There is a team of pretty amazing Australian archaeologists and a very strong team of young Indonesian students working on this site. There is rock art in this cave area that they've dated back to 35,400 years ago, and that is amongst the oldest rock art in the world. There are some very interesting links between Australia and those sites. I wish Professor Brumm's team all the very best in the excavation that they have underway. It was, for me, a real delight to be able to see that work firsthand. I wish the team every success, and I look forward to reading that research very soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will end on the note of thanking Paula Waring for her terrific company and for her organisational capacity of keeping us on time and getting us to the right places. Also a big shout out to the DFAT staff in Indonesia. It's very significant, as our largest post in the world. There is a very significant body of DFAT staff in Indonesia. I look forward to seeing Mr Gary Quinlan, our ambassador, in Newcastle. He is an alumnus of the University of Newcastle, and I believe he will be in my hometown next week. I look forward to catching up with him again there. We were really well looked after also by Richard Matthews in Makassar. Thank you to the DFAT teams both here and in Indonesia. Thank you to my colleagues for being such great company on a terrific delegation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  It's my privilege to finish my contribution to the debate on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Amendment Bill 2018 this morning, having been interrupted by events of last evening. Last night I was talking about the appalling cuts to Aboriginal smoking programs by the Abbott government in 2014. I note the amendment which has been moved by the shadow minister says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) notes that progress on lowering smoking rates has stalled following the Government's cuts to tobacco control measures; and</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should say that of course I support that amendment wholeheartedly. What they could do is look at best practice examples of programs which have been very effective in impacting smoking rates amongst some communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to point particularly to one program which has been developed by the Institute for Urban Indigenous Health in Brisbane, called Deadly Choices, which explores the historical journey of tobacco use, its acceptance and its impact on Aboriginal communities. It's a tobacco education program which is available in schools. It's a health education capacity development program that gives participants an understanding of the long association with tobacco that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have had, which helps them gain insights into the current use and acceptance of tobacco in the community. But Deadly Choices is bigger than that. It's really a health promotion program which spins around the need to address tobacco. The one-term, six-session program for schools is delivered in a flexible manner to suit school and community environments. It talks about the history and impacts of smoking; chemicals and addiction; quit support; health resources; passive smoking; and Deadly Places, Smoke-Free Spaces. It involves a 715 health check and developing links with Aboriginal medical services or health centres. That's a very important thing. We need to understand the relationship between primary health services and prevention and the way in which you can spin off programs like Deadly Choices as a result of attracting people to get a 715 check and give them an opportunity to take action to safeguard their own health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a systematic review in 2016 of these programs, and I want to quote some of the conclusions:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

Interventions that led to positive changes were 1) led by Indigenous community members; 2) implemented in partnership with non-Indigenous health workers; 3) offered as mainstream health services. However, the importance of Indigenous led commercial tobacco control interventions is three-fold. First, it demonstrates a growing recognition of the need to address the high rates of smoking in Indigenous communities—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, it recognizes that interventions will have greater community relevance if programs are supported and rooted in local community context. Third, it reflects the growing demand, made by Aboriginal communities, for control over health services through the full participation of Aboriginal individuals in decision making and implementation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, consistent with approaches to Indigenous health knowledge translation, this review found a preference for 'within the community' messages. … This was made evident through the frequent use of culturally relevant health promotion materials that were adapted to reflect the communities' unique history and culture as well as the use of Aboriginal project staff and research officers in many of the interventions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what Deadly Choices does. It's built around the expertise and drive of an organisation which is very ably led by its CEO, Mr Adrian Carson. It's got a wonderful board, a skilled board, which not only has Aboriginal people but is a skill based board. I think Bill Glasson, who's a noted eye specialist in Brisbane, is on the board, plus others. This organisation has been able to work around the funding arrangements for the Commonwealth to make sure it has a program which is effective, makes an impact and will reduce and has reduced smoking rates in its community. That's what this is about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Smoking kills. Smoking kills over 19,000 Australians each year. Smoking causes many diseases—heart disease, stroke, emphysema and a range of cancers. Smoking-related diseases—lung cancer, heart disease and vascular dementia—killed my grandparents. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disease in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse, these effects of smoking fall most heavily on vulnerable groups in our communities. Australians in the lowest socioeconomic areas are three times as likely to be daily smokers as those in the highest socioeconomic areas. Unemployed Australians are 1.7 times more likely to be smokers than those with jobs. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are 2.6 times more likely to be smokers than non-Indigenous Australians. People in rural and remote areas of Australia are twice as likely to be smokers as those who live in cities. And the impact of higher rates of smoking on these groups is exacerbated by lack of proper access to health services.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Big tobacco and their apologists might like to portray smoking as a lifestyle choice. As a pharmacist who has worked in mental health and drugs and alcohol for many years, I know nicotine is an incredibly addictive drug. Almost one in two patients in mental health inpatient units are smokers. The big tobacco companies know this, and they exploit it. They also know that plain packaging has been one of the most effective steps in reducing the incidence of smoking in recent years. Why else would they have gone to the lengths they did to try to overturn the original legislation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the far-sighted and courageous policies from the Gillard Labor government, Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, in 2012. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Act was fought by the big tobacco companies. They challenged it in the High Court and lost. They funded a challenge to the World Trade Organization, a challenge which was rejected in June this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first two years after Labor's legislation was enacted, there was a 12.8 per cent fall in tobacco consumption across Australia. Adolescent smoking rates dropped to a record low in 2014. In that year, 18.6 per cent of males and 80.2 per cent of females aged 12 to17 reported they had never smoked compared with 75.9 per cent of males and 77.4 per cent of females in 2011. As teenage years are particularly dangerous in establishing smoking habits, this fall is particularly good news. The post-implementation review of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act conducted by the Department of Health and Ageing was published in February 2016. The PIR concluded that the plain packaging measure has begun to achieve its public health objectives of reducing smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke in Australia and was expected to continue to do so into the future. The body of studies considered for the PIR showed the tobacco plain packaging measure was having an impact by reducing the appeal of tobacco products, increasing the effectiveness of health warnings and reducing the ability of the pack to mislead. The studies also provide early evidence of positive changes to actual smoking and quitting behaviours.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In simple terms, plain packaging is saving lives. Following the success of the Australian legislation, a number of other countries have adopted similar legislation or are in the process of doing so. We welcome and will support this legislation to make minor technical amendments to Labor's world-leading plain packaging legislation. But we also want to take this opportunity to tell this government that it needs to do more. Unfortunately, the steady progress on reducing smoking rates experienced over decades seems to have stalled under the current government. In 2017, the Australian health policy collaboration at Victoria University said on World No Tobacco Day:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Australia’s Health Tracker by Area reports that about 2.8 million Australian adults are current smokers. Research shows that two thirds of people who continue to smoke are likely to die because of their smoking.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Health experts agree that Australia needs ongoing media campaigns to reduce smoking, action to counter tobacco industry strategies and increased support for proven tobacco control programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with mental health problems, and disadvantaged groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To quote from Professor Mike Daube of Curtin University:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is our most preventable epidemic. We know exactly what needs to be done, but the tobacco industry has developed new strategies to keep people smoking, and governments are getting complacent. It is especially disappointing that there has been no national tobacco media campaign for several years, although this year the government expects to get more than $11 billion in tobacco tax revenue. Prevention should be a priority, not an afterthought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Sarah White, Director of Quit Victoria, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia. Investing in helping people to quit and deterring kids from starting to smoke is a no-brainer. Prevention is a better approach than spending billions trying to treat diseases that are often, sadly, not treatable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to acknowledge it is getting more challenging to help the remaining smokers. Most of those who have been able to quit, have. These are the ones for whom initiatives, to date, have not been effective. They're recalcitrant smokers. Now that the government has extensively abandoned its tax cuts to big business and big banks, perhaps that money could be directed to better understanding the problem of nicotine addiction and the ways to address it. We need to do whatever we can to support those seven-in-10 smokers who plan to quit but need help to get them started.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Smokers need to know the immediate and long-term benefits of quitting. A year after quitting, your risk of coronary heart disease is about half of that of someone who continues to smoke. If you quit smoking at 30, your life expectancy is similar to that of someone who has never smoked. We need to find ways to address the problems faced by those groups who have higher incidence of smoking—those in poorer areas, those in the regions like my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales, those with multiple and complex health needs, and Indigenous Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are quality, cost-effective, evidence based smoking cessation projects often led by public health units in public hospitals that are saving lives. I'd like to give you an example from my electorate. The pharmacist led smoking cessation project at the Central Coast local health district started at Wyong Hospital. In 2015, two of my then staff, Amy and Katie, came to me and said, 'We ask all patients on admission whether they are smokers. Then what do we about it?' This was a big problem. They'd identified a big problem. According to the New South Wales Population Health Survey conducted by the Centre for Epidemiology in 2016, 20 per cent of adults on the Central Coast were smokers compared to the state average of 15 per cent. Something needed to be done. Our LHD, the Central Coast LHD, was the second worst for smoking prevalence in New South Wales at the time. But in order to do something about it, health practitioners really needed to be better trained. I am pleased to say that Amy and Katie are now tobacco treatment and smoking cessation specialists. For less than $2,000 a health practitioner can be trained in nicotine addiction and smoking cessation. This may be an area where some of this money could be redirected. A grant then allowed Associate Professor Renee Bittoun, of the Woolcock Institute, to train our team. It was excellent training and an excellent investment by a department in a local health district.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, the pharmacy team have conducted inpatient smoking point prevalence audits to better identify smokers and offer smoking cessation, like very brief intervention, and have updated the hospital's nicotine replacement therapy formularies to include a wider range of nicotine replacement modalities and to have them on hand so they are readily available as soon as somebody is identified as a smoker. They have also committed to better train all pharmacists in smoking cessation and nicotine addiction within the health service. I'm pleased to say that this initiative has led to smoking cessation champions in the wider hospital. The cardiology division now has trained specialists and last year held a training day for cardiac, neurology and respiratory nurses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't forget the training that I was at early in my career when we were talking about smoking cessation and the time when people are most receptive. One of the junior doctors said that when someone came round from having a stroke or a heart attack, he'd lean in and say, 'I think it's time for you to stop smoking.' That type of intervention can work, at a time when people are most receptive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people, like the dedicated pharmacists at Central Coast Health, understand that addiction is a complex health problem—it is not a lifestyle choice. But it is evident from other legislation introduced by this government, such as the proposals for mandatory drug testing of income support recipients, that some on the other side just don't seem to get it. Despite the clear evidence that our plain packaging legislation has worked and has clearly saved lives, many on the other side still think this is a 'nanny state' policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have a long and proud record on tobacco control. We have shown consistent leadership, standing up to the big tobacco companies despite their formidable resources. It's now been 14 years since Labor announced that we would no longer take political donations from big tobacco. It took nearly 10 years for the Liberals to match us on that commitment. But, shamefully, the Nationals still haven't done the right thing. As recently as 2016-17 they took $15,700 from big tobacco companies. That is a disgrace, particularly when you consider that what they regard as their core constituency, rural and regional Australians, are at twice the risk from smoking as their city cousins—twice as likely to contract smoking caused diseases; twice as likely to die prematurely as result of smoking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really serious issue. This is about influence. The Southgate Institute were here this morning talking about the social determinants of health and wellbeing, and one of the social determinants they were talking about was the corporate or commercial influence in public health policy in Australia. As a former mental health worker and someone who has worked in inpatient mental health and drug and alcohol units, I believe it is something that needs to be called out and something that needs to be changed. We can't have more vulnerable people exploited by big tobacco and we can't have big tobacco continue to influence decision-making in public health policy in Australia—particularly when we know that rural and regional Australians are twice as likely to die prematurely as a result of smoking and twice as likely to contract smoking related diseases as people who live in the city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent almost 10 years working in the mental health inpatient units of my local health service. During that time smoke-free policies were introduced across NSW Health. There is so much that we can do to support people so that they are able to quit, but we need to first acknowledge that nicotine is a highly addictive drug and it needs to be treated as a complex health problem, not a lifestyle choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister must explain why he thinks it is okay for his coalition partner to accept donations from companies who profit from the 19,000 premature deaths in Australia each year from smoking related disease. But that's what we see the Liberals and Nationals doing time and again: putting the interest of big business and big banks before the wellbeing of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, I lost my grandparents to smoking related disease: heart disease, lung cancer and vascular dementia. In too many rural communities, lives are being cut short by smoking related diseases that are preventable. We know that this is the No. 1 preventable disease and we know what to do. What has to be done is that it needs to be properly funded. I call on the government to properly fund these community controlled, community led public health initiatives that are saving lives.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="140590" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  I'm incredibly proud to stand here and speak on this bill, which, for the first time, will require companies to look into their supply chains to identify modern slavery. I do so on behalf of a Labor caucus who led this debate from the very beginning. I'm making a contribution on behalf of a group of people for whom this is absolute core business. I'm really proud to contribute on their behalf.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians think that slavery is history. When I speak to people about their depictions of slavery, they often reach for pop culture references. One of the most common references that comes up is the 2013 Oscar winning film <span style="font-style:italic;">12 Years</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> a</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Slave</span>—some people in the chamber or in the gallery may have seen it before. This is a truly gut-wrenching depiction of the trans-Atlantic slave trade that took so many Africans across the Atlantic to work in slavery in the United States. 'I don't want to survive. I want to live.' Those are the words of the central character who suffered at the hands of this brutal trade. They rung in my ears for weeks after I watched this film.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is most disturbing about this movie is actually not the incredible violence that was part of this trade or even the fact that people were treated literally as property but the fact that slavery at that time was so normal for so many people that it was defended as something that was right and natural. We have come an enormous way since then and, of course, just about every person who we would speak to in this country would agree that depriving someone of their liberty is a gross violation of human rights. But society didn't progress to that view by accident. It took activists, thinkers, philosophers, politicians and community leaders to stand up and make the argument and change people's thinking, and they succeeded in doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that change in thinking, most people believe that slavery has become a thing of the past. That is not the reality. The transatlantic slave trade that was depicted in <span style="font-style:italic;">12 Years a Slave</span> saw 12½ million people transported across the Atlantic over 300 years. We know, because of the incredible work of the Walk Free Foundation, that today there are somewhere around 48 million people trapped in slavery in the world. As we stand in this parliament today, there are more people enslaved around the world than there have been at any other point in human history. We've got big responsibilities to continue the fine work that has been happening over hundreds of years to try to stamp out this practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also know about slavery is that two-thirds of those 48 million people are trapped in the Asia-Pacific, right on our doorstep. Even within our own country, we know that there are somewhere around 4,300 people who are trapped in slavery—our region, our responsibility. The lives of the people who are enslaved today might feel very remote from people who are listening to the debate today. But, in reality, their lives and ours are intertwined. These people are part of the global supply chains of some of the food we eat, the products we purchase and the clothes we wear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we deal with the bill before us, there are going to be lots of discussions about provisions and amendments and different sections. But I want to start today by talking about the people who are at the end of this horrible practice. Thailand is the largest source of seafood imports into Australia. In small parts of the Thai seafood industry, the abuse and exploitation of workers is severe. There are reports of people being trapped as slaves on ships and kept out at sea for years—literally trapped on ships so that they have no way to escape. Some of these people are reportedly forced to work up to 22 hours a day on criminally-run fishing vessels. In some cases there have been allegations of murder being committed on these boats. What is so disturbing is the fact that Australians like you and me can't be sure whether the seafood that is caught on these boats, tainted by slavery, is making its way onto our dinner tables.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many companies out there who are trying very hard to eliminate slavery from their supply chains, and I genuinely applaud their efforts, but there are others who are importing seafood from Thailand and who are not at the moment looking for slavery in their supply chains. That is the crux of this bill. For so long, companies in some instances and in some quarters have argued that what goes on in their supply chains is really none of their business. Today, for the first time, the Australian parliament is standing with a relatively united voice and saying that is not the case anymore and that we do expect companies to take responsibility for what is happening in their supply chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The clothes we're wearing right now may indeed also be tainted by slavery. Uzbekistan is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of cotton. For decades it has reportedly used forced labour, including child labour in some instances, to harvest cotton by hand. The Uniting Church have done a lot of incredible work in this area, and they have argued that this appalling practice may meet the threshold for slave labour. They've also found that 99.5 per cent of the cotton exported from Uzbekistan to developing countries is exported into Asia, mainly to China and Bangladesh. That cotton is then milled and converted to textiles, and it can very well make its way into clothing that's sold right here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's clear that products tainted by slavery are sometimes on our supermarket shelves and the shelves of shops that we shop at, many people don't even realise that slavery is in fact happening right here in our own country. In my home state of Victoria, I have heard of some appalling labour practices that are in our horticultural supply chain. I spoke to the National Union of Workers last year in the discussion about this bill and more recently, a number of weeks ago, about worker exploitation and modern slavery. They are very much on the frontline of these practices. What they told me was absolutely shocking. They told me about a transnational organisation operating both here and in Malaysia that is arranging visas, housing and transport for workers. The workers are reportedly paid only $150 for an entire week's work. They're crammed into a single house with 12 to 15 other people and they're told that, if they don't work a 17-hour day, then not only will they have no job the next day but, indeed, their physical security may be under threat and their families in the countries that they have emigrated from might be under threat. These are the faces of modern slavery. People are trapped here in our suburb, oceans away from home with no realistic way to leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One really heartbreaking case that I have been told about was a man who was living in Australia on a bridging visa and he'd come here to seek refuge from his home country. He was working 17-hour days on a Victorian farm, being paid well below the minimum wage, and he crashed his car and died trying to go from work to the home he'd been given. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share the story of someone that we'll call Sun for this debate. This story has been shared by Anti Slavery Australia as one of the faces of slavery they're advocating for. Sun was introduced to an agent in South Korea who promised to help her find a job in the sex work industry in Sydney. Sex work is decriminalised in New South Wales, so she was not committing a crime by coming to Australia to seek work. However, when she arrived in Sydney, she quickly became a victim of modern slavery. She was placed in a sex parlour and told by the owner that she must pay a $25,000 debt for her flight and her visa. She was told she would not receive any money until her debt was paid off. She was forced to live in an apartment adjoining the parlour. She was not permitted to leave the premises unsupervised. She worked 14 hours a day, six days a week and sometimes even on her day off. She was not allowed to take safety precautions in the work she was doing. The boss of the parlour threatened Sun with deportation if she complained too much, refused a customer or tried to go to the authorities for help. She was completely genuinely trapped. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery is happening all around us. In fact, many people listening today might be aware that recently we learned that there's modern slavery happening within a few kilometres of this building. Earlier this year, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> undertook an investigation into worker exploitation in foreign embassies here in Canberra. In their report, they told the harrowing stories of three workers who were kept in slave-like conditions by diplomats living right here within a couple of kilometres of Parliament House. Sadly, we know that these are not isolated incidents. According to the Salvation Army, at least 20 domestic workers have escaped exploitation from diplomatic residences. Some of these workers were reportedly made to work 12 to 18 hours a day for a fraction of the minimum wage and were forbidden from leaving their embassies. Modern slavery is everywhere we look. The problem that we face is that we are not looking enough and that brings us to the bill before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tackling slavery and exploitation is absolutely core to Labor's mission. We are absolutely committed to stamping out worker exploitation and human rights abuses. Although modern slavery is all around us, today it is a hidden problem. It's not going to be uncovered, dealt with or stamped out without meaningful attempts to change that. Last year, after many months of consultation and discussion with stakeholders, Labor announced a modern slavery policy, and the centrepiece of that was a modern slavery act. We believe that a modern slavery act will have a real impact on this problem—if that act has penalties and the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner. The Leader of the Opposition and I were joined at the announcement of this policy by representatives of business, civil society and the union movement, including the wonderful now member for Batman. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we announced this policy, we committed to penalties for companies who do not comply with modern slavery reporting requirements, because we believe that there is no excuse for not looking. For a long time, companies have argued that what their suppliers do is none of their business, and we just believe that is not good enough anymore. I understand there are different views in the parliament about penalties and I know that there'll be continued discussion on this subject over the coming days and weeks. I just want to make it absolutely crystal clear that complying with Australian law is not optional; it's not optional for the ordinary citizen, it's not optional for people that sit in this chamber and it should not be optional for big business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we believe is that fighting slavery is one of the most important things we can do to improve the human rights situation for people around the world. I find it difficult, frankly, to understand how we could create a regime that says that we would like companies to provide a public report on these matters but we're not going to require them to do so. I think we can make a clearer statement to the community and the business sector that, with them, we have a genuine and fierce commitment to fighting this issue. We are only going to be able to do that with a bill that contains penalties. So Labor will be moving amendments to this bill to introduce immediate penalties for companies that fail to submit a modern slavery statement and penalties for companies that submit inadequate modern slavery statements, with a delayed two-year start, recognising that this is going to be a change for business. For some businesses, it will be challenging to make that change, and we agree that they need some time to be able to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also moving amendments to this bill to require the minister to make an annual report to parliament on the operation of the act and include in that report the list of companies the minister believes are required to report and those that the minister believes are noncompliant in not providing a report. If I can just make it crystal clear to the parliament, to the people at home who are watching, what's required in this act is for big Australian companies to make a report on what they are doing to ensure that there's not slavery in their supply chain. When we talk about penalties, when we talk about making a report to the parliament about who is compliant and who is not compliant, we are merely talking about companies above a certain threshold—$100 million is the amount that appears to be the view of the parliament. We are merely requiring them to make a public report. It seems to Labor and it seems to me that it is a pretty fair enough ask of business to just make that report. We do think it's appropriate, if a business in this country operating under Australian law with all the protections that that includes cannot be bothered to look into its supply chain to make a report, that it should be financially penalised and also penalised by ensuring that Australians around this country who are making consumer decisions in supermarkets, in retail stores know that there are some companies that are not compliant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it clear that there are lots of businesses that have been extremely supportive of what is contained in this Modern Slavery Act. The report that we are asking the minister to make annually about compliance with the Modern Slavery Act will also allow the parliament the opportunity to speak about best practices and that's going to be really important too. For the companies that are doing so much hard work on this—and they are there; there are many of them—we want to make sure that the parliament has an opportunity to shine a light on what those best-practice companies are doing and, in doing so, create a race to the top.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that penalties are necessary for the modern slavery act because we have a living example of what happens when an act does not contain penalties—that is, the UK version. The structure of the bill before us is very much based on what we are learning from the UK as it leads a fight to tackle slavery in its own region. There are lots of successes that we can point to in the UK act but compliance is probably, in fairness, not one of them. One of the main things that we can do in this parliament is, a number of the years after the UK's had their act in place, learn from their experience. And we can improve on it. One of the things that I believe we can very much improve on is the imposition of penalties. What we know from the UK version is that, in the three years since the UK Modern Slavery Act's enactment, only about half of the 9,000 to 11,000 organisations that the UK government estimates are required to report have produced a slavery and human trafficking statement. Just stepping back: the UK parliament requires companies above a certain threshold merely to report on what it is that they are doing to fight slavery in their supply chains and, without penalties, only half of the relevant companies in the UK are complying with that act. We're talking here about slavery, one of the gravest possible human rights violations that there is. I do think we can see and learn from that experience that if we are getting half compliance in the UK over three years then we are going to need to encourage our public companies, our big companies, in Australia to comply with this act, which I believe many of them will enthusiastically and willingly do. I do believe the UK example makes it quite clear that penalties will need to be a part of this discussion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something else that's crucially important to the success of the UK modern slavery infrastructure—that is, the existence of an independent antislavery commissioner. The independent antislavery commissioner that is the subject of a second reading amendment from Labor is crucial to both supporting big business as they try to implement their statements and assisting victims who are trapped in modern slavery right here in Australia. I mentioned that there are somewhere around 4,300 people who we know are trapped in slavery in our country right now. You only need to read the newspaper to see that probably every three months or so there is a major expose of a slavery ring or some type of slavery operation occurring in our country. So the media are finding this when they look, but Senate estimates revealed last year that, in the last half decade, we have been able to secure seven convictions for slavery. There are 4,300 slaves in our country right now whose liberty is being deprived, and we've had seven convictions over five years. Clearly, there is a major issue with the way that our federal criminal law is dealing with prosecutions and enforcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable, and it does require specialist expertise to encourage people who are victims to come forward, because we need their help to put human traffickers and people who are responsible for slavery in jail. An independent antislavery commissioner can assist with a lot of these gaps. They can support enforcement, they can help victims and they can work with the incredible organisations in civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. The Modern Slavery Bill that's before us is going to help and is very useful, but we believe that, without an independent antislavery commissioner, we're going to have an essential piece of the puzzle missing here, and Labor has made a commitment that in government we will implement an independent antislavery commissioner. If we're not able to get the agreement of the parliament and the various political parties that will represent this issue in the Senate, a future Labor government will make that change. I'll be moving a second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition, calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Labor will be moving amendments to this bill to remove forced marriage from the scope of the reporting requirements under this bill. Our current approach to forced marriage is not working. I've said that on the record several times and I'll say it again here. Since the time of the election of the government on the other side of the chamber, we haven't secured a single successful prosecution for a forced marriage offence under the Criminal Code. I referred to pretty regular media reports about the issue of modern slavery; there are also pretty regular media reports about the issue of forced marriage but not a single conviction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, alongside the deputy Labor leader and the member for Sydney, we announced Labor's policy to overhaul Australia's response to forced marriage, and there are some very obvious problems standing in the path of victims of forced marriage coming forward. We announced that Labor will increase funding for civil society and establish a forced marriage unit to provide a one-stop shop to connect victims to support services, government agencies and assistance for Australians who are under threat of being taken overseas to be married against their will. That is a solution to the problem that we have with this very vulnerable cohort of victims of forced marriage. It is actually quite difficult for them to access support. They're in a very vulnerable situation, and it's often not in the interests of the people around them to help them access support, so we're going to try to help change that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also going to fully remove the cooperation requirement for victims of forced marriage. Today, if a victim of forced marriage wants to get the assistance of the Australian government to escape from that marriage, they need to agree to cooperate with the police investigation. For lots of us in this room, perhaps that doesn't sound like such a big thing, but for victims of forced marriage it is a huge thing. Often people who are a victim of forced marriage have members of their own family who have tried to facilitate the marriage. So we've created a situation under Australian law where, if a young woman, for example, is the victim of a forced marriage, to get the assistance of government to escape from that marriage she has to testify against her own parents. That is not a good outcome for justice and, indeed, it is not leading to justice. That is very clear on the facts. We are going to fully remove the cooperation requirement for victims of forced marriage, agreeing that if a young woman is being forced into a marriage against her will, she deserves the support of the state in an unconditional manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has recently announced a limited trial to improve the support services that are offered to victims of forced marriage. We are pleased to see that small step forward but we believe there's a lot more that can be done. The reason I'm referring to forced marriage is because the way that this Modern Slavery Bill is constructed brings the definition of forced marriage into the reporting requirements for a modern slavery act. Labor has spoken to stakeholders about this question, and there are different views within the stakeholder community. We are concerned that the inclusion of forced marriage in this bill will have a lot of unintended consequences, and the worst thing we can do for victims of forced marriage is push that problem further from public view. We believe that that would be one of the consequences of including it in a modern slavery act.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can explain this clearly, the bill before the parliament is requiring big companies to provide a public report on what they are doing to check for slavery in their supply chains. In practice, if we add forced marriage to that definition, we are creating an opportunity for a company to look into the private lives of the people it employs. Labor doesn't want to create an issue along those lines. It's something that we will monitor, and we will continue to be part of the discussion, but we don't think at this stage that this is something we will want to include in a first draft of the Modern Slavery Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken about a number of amendments that Labor wants to have considered by the government, by the crossbench and by the Senate. I'm very hopeful that the fruitful discussions that I've had so far with my opposite number will result in a modern slavery act that the Australian parliament can be very proud of. I will leave a detailed discussion on some of those amendments to the consideration in detail stage, but I want to make it clear that there are aspects of this bill that Labor would've done very differently. There's no question about that. I've particularly spoken about the importance of having a penalties regime attached to the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge on behalf of my party that we see this as a step forward. We're pleased to see that the Australian parliament is united in its view that modern slavery cannot be tolerated. It can't be tolerated because the values of the people we represent do not support it. I'm pleased to see the Australian parliament moving towards a regime that would make it clear that we believe, as a parliament, that Australian companies are responsible for what goes on in their supply chain. They're not criminally responsible, but we do expect them to look. To not know is not an excuse. That is what the Australian parliament is saying when we stand up and support this version of a modern slavery act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're pleased to see that the government's draft of this bill includes a requirement that the minister prepare a modern slavery statement for the Commonwealth. That is, for all the money that the government is spending on various things, we're asking the Commonwealth government for the first time to make the type of inquiries into their supply chains that we are asking of big business. That's a very welcome measure, and we support that the government is also being held to account.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow minister responsible for this area, one of the great privileges of my time in this parliament has been working with the incredible group of advocates and the civil society sector who have been working for so long to see something like this come before the Australian parliament for debate. I want to share the names of some of the people for whom I'm so full of admiration for their hard work and advocacy: Dr Jennifer Burn and her team at Anti Slavery Australia; Dr Mark Zirnsak from the Uniting Church; Heather Moore from the Salvation Army; Carolyn and Fuzz Kitto from STOP THE TRAFFIK; and the incredible Fiona McLeod SC and Morry Bailes from the Law Council of Australia. Andrew Forrest and Chris Evans from the Walk Free Foundation have done huge work on this and have been very involved in the discussion on the other side of the chamber, which has been hugely helpful. I thank the mighty trade union movement, particularly Aira Firdaus, Tim Nelthorpe and the amazing National Union of Workers, who are on the ground fighting worker exploitation every single day, and Andrea Maksimovic from the ACTU and the very hardworking people in that organisation who've been pushing this forward. Of course, I want to acknowledge Christine Carolan and her team at ACRATH. Every member of parliament in this chamber has probably been visited by the incredible women who run this organisation; some of them are Catholic nuns. They are a truly incredible group of people. I absolutely cherish the time that I've spent with them discussing these issues.</span>

We simply wouldn't be here today introducing reforms if it weren't for that tireless advocacy and commitment to making the world a better place, and I really do truly believe that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I opened my comments today by talking about the abolition of slavery in the 19th century. I said then that it wouldn't have happened without the group of people who fought over decades—in fact, some organisations tackled this horrible practice over centuries. I wouldn't say we face a challenge of a similar scope, but we do face a challenge that is very large in size and very difficult to tackle. Our work to end slavery in the 21st century is going to require huge cooperation, determination and drive. This is very much the beginning of our work to stop this practice, but I know there are lots of people in this country and on both sides of the chamber who are trying to make big steps forward, and I really commend their efforts.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="248969" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREWTHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I'm very proud to be here today to speak to the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. It is a lengthy path we have travelled to get to this incredible point where we are debating legislation to work towards eradicating modern slavery in Australia, in our region and around the world. I'm proud that, ever since I presented the House in December with the Foreign Affairs and Aid Sub-Committee's report called <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in plain sight</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span>, we've continued to action the recommendations of that inquiry to bring about this bill. I'm proud of the coalition government for initiating not only the inquiry but this bill before the House today and of the cross-party support for this bill as well. I'm also proud that the Morrison government has seen this through to fruition, with a debate coming up today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue, in which we are now actively taking part to eradicate it, has been a significant focus of much of my time in Canberra since I was elected in 2016. I think it is now starting to truly resonate with the community. While we might see the odd report on the news about backpackers in the horticultural industry, for example, being taken advantage of or about foreign nationals being found to be in domestic servitude, until more recently these have been disconnected stories. Now these incidents are no longer isolated but are part of a bigger, grimmer narrative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The term 'modern slavery' is slowly working its way into the public's mind and consciousness. Even the local media outlets in Dunkley have picked up on some of these activities with interest. Even though the subcommittee's report was submitted some time ago, the responses from the government and the introduction of the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 have truly woken up some who undertook business with a very complacent approach. The stories that we heard during the inquiry and beyond have captured the public's imagination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am horrified by some of these stories as well, and I'm sure members across this chamber and the community have been truly touched by some of the incidents that have occurred, but I am honoured to have been the member of this parliament who proposed that we seek a referral for this inquiry. That was as Chair of the Foreign Affairs and Aid Sub-Committee in October 2016, with the strong support of the then foreign minister. The inquiry was then referred to the committee by the Attorney-General in February 2017. We then put out an initial report, which led to a consultation phase and an initial commitment to modern slavery legislation. This was followed by the final report and then a commitment to introduce the bill by the middle of this year and to pass this bill through parliament by the end of this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said when I first started as the chair of the subcommittee that I didn't want to do a report which sat on the shelves gathering dust; I wanted to do a report that actually led to results. This bill is the result of much hard work, not only by me but by members of that committee across the chamber and across parties, who put so much effort into bringing this bill about so we can actually tackle this important issue. Our inquiry examined best practice in fighting modern slavery both in Australia and globally. In doing so, we examined the UK's Modern Slavery Act 2015 to assess its effectiveness, as well as measures adopted in various other countries around the world—such as the US, France and the Netherlands—and how these approaches could be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also note the work of so many advocates, without whom many of these issues perhaps wouldn't have been brought to the attention of parliamentarians and the wider community. I note Fuzz and Carolyn Kitto, who are with us in the gallery here today. There are many other people too—Heather Moore, Andrew Forrest and so many others—who have been strong advocates around this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Slavery and exploitation continue to be scourges around the world. Modern slavery is an umbrella concept covering a number of different forms of exploitation such as forced labour, debt bondage, sexual slavery, child labour, orphanage trafficking, human trafficking more generally and forced marriage, to name but a few. It is estimated that there are currently more than 40 million victims of modern slavery globally, including more than 31 million in our region and an estimated 15,000 in Australia on latest statistics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These crimes are already illegal under Australian law. They're covered by sections 270 and 271 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, the Australian government maintains an ongoing commitment to stopping slavery in Australia, and globally, through both the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery and the Bali Process. Nevertheless, modern slavery remains notoriously difficult to stop, and we must do more to actually enforce the legislation that is already in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many cases, it is a hidden crime which can be inadvertently supported by the community. Some industries, such as the fashion trade, have already been exposed to problems deep in their supply chains. H&amp;M and Zara, for instance, came under a great deal of public scrutiny over their operations and measures to prevent exploitation in their supply chains. The public reactions and the community pressure applied to these cases not long ago has given me a lot of hope that this legislation will have the full support of the Australian community, as we, as consumers, have high expectations of Australian companies, organisations and, indeed, governments to act ethically and to do the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation addresses only one aspect of the subcommittee's report, such was its extent. It listed a number of recommendations not only relating to supply chain mechanisms but also relating to visas and a whole range of different issues. Transparency for businesses and entities in their supply chains, though, is one key aspect that our inquiry examined very closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Globalisation has created a serious risk of entities inadvertently accessing goods partially supplied through modern slavery, not only just within tier 1 but also within the other tiers throughout the supply chain. The depth of a business's supply chains can make it very difficult for an Australian importer to understand exactly where items come from. While a shirt may have, for example, 'Made in Bangladesh' on its tag, the cotton could come from Uzbekistan, the dye from India and the buttons from North Korea. This creates a number of problems. Firstly, our foremost concern is that Australian shoppers could inadvertently support modern slavery. One part of a shirt may have been manufactured using forced labour; however, because it is only an element of the end product, it may not be found out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, competitive disadvantage is often created for businesses doing the right thing. For example, Haigh's Chocolates have made efforts to eliminate the risk of modern slavery in their supply chains; however, Haigh's can lose out in the market to those who do not have the same attentiveness to the risk of modern slavery and who can, therefore, outprice them. This also can occur in the horticultural industry, where you have people doing the right thing who are being underpriced by those who aren't doing the right thing, whether that's through imported goods or goods produced in Australia. Therefore, those who are doing the right thing can't compete either locally or internationally when there is exploitation or modern slavery happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, the outcome of the government's response to our report has resulted in this Modern Slavery Bill today, with mandatory supply chain reporting for entities with revenue above $100 million as well as a mandated central repository of statements. Furthermore, by creating an optional reporting opt-in for entities below the $100 million threshold, we can incentivise smaller businesses who want to help combat these crimes, and we have found that many do. The strong social conscience of Australian society firmly suggests that opt-in measures will be well received by a large sector of the business community. This is an incentive based approach. I note that this does not include penalties at this stage—that's not to say that there won't be in the future, given a three-year review clause—but the measures are still very strong. In particular, the introduction of a world-first measure to include government in the reporting requirements shows that we are not simply creating additional red tape for businesses but that we think this issue is so important that we are putting our own procurement and supply chain processes under the microscope along with theirs. This will really make a difference in the supply chains of Australian businesses and organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an incredibly complex and extensive issue—I think far more extensive than anyone realised before we began the inquiry. Most people I speak to are astounded by how widespread modern slavery is, especially in Australia, and we by no means will address the whole subject with one piece of legislation. I especially want to congratulate the minister on introducing the legislation and all those ministers involved on their steadfast support throughout this entire process. I am enthusiastically looking towards the ways we can address other aspects of modern slavery, as this is only the beginning. We made a number of different recommendations in our final report which go beyond just this bill before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the stories received by the subcommittee during the inquiry have stunned many people. We heard from Sinet Chan, a young Cambodian woman who was sent to an orphanage at the age of nine but was exploited by its directors. We heard about Mohammed Rowi, a Malaysian man, who was given no payment for work in northern Victoria. I was also shocked by the story of a woman who was forced to live in the wall cavity of a brothel in Seaford, in my own electorate of Dunkley. These stories are a microcosm of the experiences suffered by victims globally and unfortunately reflect the abuse and suffering wrought by the worst of humanity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these horrors, the subcommittee also received information about the work of people who are trying to stamp out modern slavery and assist victims. I'm sure many of those people are here watching in the chamber today and also over the streaming via video. We heard from groups committed to stopping human trafficking in orphanages, for example, in South-East Asia and in Africa. We listened to some of the biggest companies in Australia and globally who are determined to stop forced labour being in any part of their supply chains. We spoke to faith representatives, unions and many others who continue to show compassion and understanding for those most vulnerable of people, seeking to help them in their plight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is indeed an issue that has brought together both the left and the right not only in politics but also in the broader community, and that was represented by the many submissions received and the interviews we had as part of the inquiry process. Together, these accounts and efforts play a very important role in bringing modern slavery out of the shadows. It continues to be a hidden crime, but victims are in our backyards, whether they be in Seaford, Parramatta, Cairns or elsewhere. We need to take action. I note that this is not the fault of any community. The perpetrators of modern slavery try to keep their victims hidden, scared to report their abuse to authorities. But, by telling these stories and understanding victims, we can grasp how to tackle the problem of modern slavery. That is why we are taking steps to eradicate it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is undoubtedly a clear need to tackle this issue. This bill goes a long way to doing so, but, as I said, we are only at the beginning. I believe the first three years before the review period will be instructive not only in receiving practical feedback but also in learning how we can better work with the business community and the wider community to improve reporting methodology and tackle modern slavery. As many people have said, though, we can't let the perfect get in the way of the good—and this is a very important step in the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, I must note that the bill does improve on the UK's Modern Slavery Act in a number of different ways. As I mentioned before, there is a requirement for a legislated central repository of modern slavery statements. This improves upon the UK act, which doesn't have that requirement, and where it has been introduced by not-for-profit organisations. We've included the Commonwealth government and government business enterprises in reporting on modern slavery—a world first. We've included a legislated opt-in for entities below the threshold. We've also included legislative prescriptions for what reporting should include, which also goes beyond that of the UK act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, I have been following the Senate's inquiry into the bill and I am aware of a number of suggestions that they have raised: for example, the need for a commissioner or, indeed, as noted in the Senate inquiry's recent report, an independent statutory officer—which is one of the recommendations that we put in our final report and one that I think is important going forward. There is also, I believe, a chance for further compliance measures—for example, government putting forward a list of those organisations that need to report and also those that have reported and haven't reported. Hopefully that can be included in an amendment process subject to it coming before the Senate. But, if not, that can also be implemented outside of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm hopeful that, in addition to the review, we will have a rolling review. That also doesn't need to be in the legislation, but it can be a decision made by government to have a review of the legislation, not only after three years but on a rolling basis. I am also hopeful that, through the Senate inquiry report, which reflected a number of our recommendations, we can look into the future, through our review mechanism or through future amendments, to introduce an independent statutory officer who will not only sit separately but also, as we have seen in the UK, be a strong person for advocating for tackling modern slavery and connecting businesses, organisations and governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank all the ministers involved from the beginning—not only the former foreign minister and the former Attorney-General in particular but also those more recently, including the current Special Minister of State, who was particularly instrumental previously as the then Assistant Minister for Home Affairs. I worked very closely with him on this bill and I hope to continue working closely with him as this goes through the parliament. It is for these many reasons that I've mentioned above that I urge my colleagues and I urge the wider community to take a bipartisan approach towards this issue that should not exist in the 21st century. I commend this bill to the House and I commend the work that has gone into this across the chamber and across the wider community.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I also rise to make a contribution on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. It's regrettable that, in a country like Australia, one would ordinarily think that we would need such a bill. But the reality is, whether we're talking about food processing or whether we're talking about apparel, we're an importing country and, largely, many things are just taken for granted. We are also a very accepting country. Regrettably, the number of people who we deal with and the number of enterprises that we deal with will put profit lines and will put cash, if you like, ahead of things such as human rights. Hence, it is appropriate that government brings forward the Modern Slavery Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should say from the outset that Labor will support the passage of this bill. We think it is a step in the right direction, albeit I will pick up on a number of the statements made by the member for Dunkley. I congratulate him on his contribution. I suspect he probably does have the view that if he had a free vote he would probably vote for the amendments in relation to penalties as well as having an independent commissioner or a statutory officer associated with the implementation of this bill. But it is a step in the right direction, though.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation we do have ongoing responsibilities and commitments to protecting Australians against modern slavery, not only under our domestic laws but also in the context of our international framework. Modern slavery engages a number of Australia's international human rights obligations, as protected in a number of international human rights instruments—most notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These are rights which are absolute rights of freedom from slavery and forced labour, from torture and from cruelty and other inhumane or degrading treatments or punishments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection against slavery is one of those specific rights that the International Court of Justice has determined is a protection lent to global citizens under international law. It's not just what you apply to your own citizens. As the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is up to each and every one of us to raise our voice against crimes that deprive countless victims of their liberty, dignity and human rights.  We have to work together to realize the equal rights promised to all by the United Nations Charter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the widely accepted protections against slavery on an international level, unfortunately, the statistics tell us a completely different story. Many, many people are today trapped in a situation of slavery or enforced labour around the world. Regrettably, the statistics actually say there are more people trapped in slavery than at any other time in human history. According to the International Centre for Human Rights, there are approximately 48.5 million people in slavery around the world. What is most alarming and, I suppose, would shock most people is that 4,300 people are estimated to be currently in slave like conditions here in Australia. That is just simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Slavery remains hidden from many of us yet can be the result of our actions in what seems to be the innocent purchasing of products for our food, as we heard from the member for Dunkley. Whether you're buying a shirt made in Bangladesh not knowing how it was made and where the cotton, the fabric, the dyes or the pigments were sourced, or whether you're buying the various foods that we eat, as a purchaser, you don't and would not be expected to go through and itemise all those things to satisfy yourself before making that purchase. I think the Redfern Legal Centre put it in perspective when they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sometimes people are hidden behind closed doors, sometimes they are hidden in plain sight. The person who attaches the gutters to your roof, cares for your neighbour’s children, cleans your car, makes your clothes or serves your food could be a victim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it in even more perspective, I would like to share just one example of modern slavery here in this country when we look at some of the foods that we can buy from our supermarket. Many, many cases have been recorded of fish caught by Thai fishing vessels operating in South-East Asian waters which have a documented history of physical abuse and the deprivation of the liberty of their workers. Inhumane working conditions are pretty widespread for their workers. Nevertheless, we continue to see the seafood on our shelves and we continue to buy it from Australian retailers. These are things we do need to address and this bill will address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention an organisation in my community that is doing a fantastic job in a very practical way helping people free themselves from forced labour and what we would think of as modern slavery. It's called Asian Women at Work, a remarkable organisation in the community that does a lot of good work on the ground.  Lina Cabaero is the coordinator of the centre together with Bich Thuy Pham, a Vietnamese community worker, and they do a great job. They go out and talk to women, mainly women from Asian backgrounds, working in what can be only be described as backyard businesses. A lot of the women have little English, they don't know their rights under Australian law and work under terribly harsh conditions. These women actually go out and tell them they're rights, encourage them to speak up, and also show them where they are being exploited. That is happening in our communities at the moment in Western Sydney. Simply turning a blind eye to slavery should not be an option. I would suggest no Australian would want to go out and purchase goods knowing that they were tainted by slavery or businesses that had slavery in their supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been committed for some time to the Modern Slavery Act. Unlike the British version of it, on which this Modern Slavery Bill is modelled, we think it needs to go further. We think, as the amendment indicates, that there should be penalties attached to it—not simply a voluntary reporting code for most organisations, but penalties—and an antislavery commissioner appointed; a person who will have a statutory role to not only help investigate but also address the consequences of slavery in our community. Nevertheless, in terms of a modern slavery act, it is certainly welcomed by businesses, by the trade union movement and, I think, by any fair-minded citizen in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's pleasing that the government has appreciated the need for a modern slavery bill, the bill, as it stands, is not adequate. We are deeply disappointed that the government has put this bill forward without penalties attached to it. It has chosen to go down the path of a business engagement unit, where business can be consulted and liaised with. We think the bill needs to have more teeth than that. It needs to have an independent statutorily appointed commissioner for antislavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With a lack of appropriate protections, we risk the real possibility of companies exploiting individuals further as they find loopholes to get around the requirements of this act. Let's face it: as I said from the start, many companies will chase lower costs at the expense of human rights. I don't think simply having a voluntary reporting method for those companies under the $100 million threshold catches the backyard sweatshops that we know operate in various communities. They're not going to go and voluntarily dob themselves in. We need something with a little bit more teeth in it if we're going to be serious about doing something to curb modern slavery in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take some comfort from the words of Keren Adams, the Director of Legal Advocacy for the Human Rights Law Centre:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Without financial penalties—and with no independent Commissioner to help enforce them—the new laws will lack the necessary teeth to make sure the worst offenders lift their game.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government must urgently address the weaknesses in this bill and send a strong message to brands that profiting from abuse will not be tolerated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Keren Adams is right in that regard. The absence of penalties in this bill makes no sense at all. We cannot leave big business to effectively police themselves, and that's what we're being invited to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's basically the situation in Britain itself. The experience in Great Britain is that, since the introduction of their Modern Slavery Bill, only about 30 per cent of those businesses caught up in the slavery chain have reported themselves, under voluntary reporting codes, to the government. If we're going to make a dent in this in a way where we want to play our part in eradicating modern slavery, I think we need to go further—and bear in mind that Australia currently holds a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council. We have a leading role to play in this regard. This is not just following Great Britain along the line and thinking, 'We'll just take steps to emulate what they're doing.' It is time that we actually showed leadership in this space, because we have that seat on the UN Human Rights Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be encouraging others to stand up for human rights within their share of influence. The government is moving in that direction, and I congratulate it for that. It is regrettable that it has not sought to put the necessary teeth in this legislation to make sure that it really bites at the issue and acts in a way that has penalties attached for those that wilfully disregard the notion of dealing with slavery in their supply chains. This legislation fails to appoint a statutory officer to look at enforcement and to address the actual issues on the ground of modern slavery within our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another group I'd particularly like to mention in the short time I have left: the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking Humans, ACRATH. I know colleagues on both sides would have been visited by Sister Ng and Sister Diana Hayes recently, together with Genevieve Skruzny from ACRATH. It is a remarkable organisation. I have been meeting with Sister Margaret Ng for a number of years now, since I have a very large Vietnamese population in my community. Sister Ng is a Vietnamese Catholic nun of the Order of Saint Joseph. She has worked pretty extensively with prostitutes in our community. Here's this pint-sized Catholic nun who gets out there and supports women who, for various reasons—many of them are paying off family debts—find themselves engaged in the prostitution industry, the sex industry, of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This organisation does a remarkable job working with people in need. They get out and work with them in a non-judgemental way and try to ensure that they support these young women in those circumstances. When Sister Ng was with us only recently, she said, 'Labor must seek amendments to the legislation. We do need penalties attached to this and we do need an independent commissioner.' ACRATH were specific about that, and I put their words on the record.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I rise today in proud support of the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. When you hear the words 'slavery bill' or even 'modern slavery bill', you can't help but think that maybe we're about 200 years late. But the brutal reality is that, as with piracy, another rather nasty relic of the past, slavery—or, more specifically, modern slavery—is alive and well and flourishing in the 21st century. It is often as part of highly sophisticated global businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What exactly is modern slavery? Today, slavery is less about people directly owning other people as a legal arrangement—although this sadly does still happen—and is more about a de facto form of ownership that is often hidden. The situation for those in slavery is, however, not much different from the slaves of centuries past, where people—often children—were trafficked, controlled and ruthlessly exploited by someone, without any viable option to simply withdraw their labour and leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the purposes of this bill, and especially the reporting requirement it seeks to introduce, modern slavery is defined quite broadly to include all forms of 'trafficking in persons, slavery, slavery-like practices (including forced labour and forced marriage) and the worst forms of child labour (including using children for prostitution or in hazardous work)'. An individual may also be regarded as being in slavery if they are forced to work by direct or implied coercion or have restrictions placed on their freedom of choice, freedom of movement or basic human rights.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people assume that slavery ended with the abolition movement in the 19th century. However, using our modern definition, surprisingly, there are perhaps more human beings living in a state of slavery today than at any other time in history—and it is generally hidden. Unlike the slavery of the 19th century, as seen in the Belgian Congo and the plantations of the new world, slavery has today transformed itself to serve our insatiable global consumer economy and its demand for low-cost goods and services. Modern slavery may not be as easy to see as it was in ages past but it's there, it's appalling and it is our shared shame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery can occur in any sector or industry and at any point along the supply chain. Internationally, situations with a high risk of exposure to modern slavery include rural workers; women and children engaged in sweatshops; girls forced into marriage, prostitution or domestic service; and, in poorly-regulated jurisdictions, workers involved in construction, electronics, fashion and hospitality. Many who fall victim to these one-sided arrangements often endure lives almost totally controlled by their exploiters. They no longer have a free choice or meaningful protection under the law. They accept what they are offered, often live in a squalid condition and typically do exactly as they are told. They are, in effect, slaves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations estimates there to be some 48 million victims of modern slavery worldwide, with over 4,000 in Australia alone. The International Labour Organisation estimates 11.7 million victims are spread across the Asia-Pacific region, in which, not coincidentally, the supply chains of a significant number of large businesses that operate in Australia are based.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has undertaken to combat human trafficking and slavery through the ratification of a number of international human rights treaties. We therefore have an obligation to take all reasonable steps to require that companies operating in Australia do not derive revenue or any benefit whatsoever from human trafficking and slavery. Due to traditionally cheaper wages and less regulated conditions, a great deal of labour across the Asia-Pacific region is dedicated towards cheaply produced material goods to be sold into developed consumer economies, including Australia. The fact is that, as the middle class grows and currencies strengthen in many developing countries and economies, traditional pools of relatively cheap labour have contracted to effectively create an expanding niche for modern slavery. This expansion of modern slavery has invariably implicated nations such as Australia and the United States via global supply chains that feed an insatiable demand for low-cost consumer goods and especially for clothing, footwear, homewares and electronics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should come as no surprise that corporations are driven to maximise profit and minimise risk for their shareholders—and rightly so. However, there is currently very little incentive for businesses that are active in Australia to meticulously pick over their supply chains to ensure they are risk-free when it comes to modern slavery. This means that companies that cut corners or turn a blind eye to benefits from modern slavery, whether directly or indirectly, not only contribute to the sum of human suffering but may currently also enjoy a competitive advantage over those businesses that, in contrast, are doing the right thing. This situation, where proven, is more than unfair; it's obscene.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern-day consumers are demanding ethically sourced products and are only able to make informed decisions about their purchases when companies are transparent about their supply chains. The current lack of transparency around what companies are doing in their supply chains effectively leads consumers to avoid ethical considerations by taking retailers at face value and defaulting to price alone. As a result of the recommendations coming from the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into establishing a modern-day slavery act here in Australia, this bill will introduce a modern slavery reporting requirement. I commend the work of the joint standing committee in driving an inquiry that received some 225 separate submissions and held 11 public hearings around the country, with their final report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in plain sight: an inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia</span>, being tabled in December last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following extensive consultation by government, the resulting reporting requirement will require large corporations and other entities with over $100 million of annual consolidated revenue to publish annual statements detailing their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. This requirement will also apply to foreign businesses with operations here in Australia. Annual statements will need to address modern slavery risks in the relevant company supply chain and detail what steps they have taken and will take to mitigate such risks. The statements will also detail the methodology by which the entity proposes to assess the effectiveness of proposed remedies. Modern slavery statements will be due six months from the end of the entity's final year and must be signed by a responsible member for that entity, approved by the principal governing body of the entity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for a statutory review of the legislation every three years to ensure the modern slavery reporting requirement remains appropriately targeted and effective. In a world first for the public sector, the Australian government will lead by example by also meeting the requirement to publish annual statements to cover any possible modern slavery risk in Commonwealth procurement. Commonwealth statements, together with the annual statements of commercial entities, will be available to the public via an online register. This will ensure that private individuals can easily access and compare statements and make choices, if they so please, based on that information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed reporting requirement will serve to assist the business community in Australia to take proactive and effective actions to address the blight of modern slavery. The Morrison coalition government wants to put these steps in place to help lessen the risk of modern slavery practices occurring in the supply chains of goods and services in the Australian marketplace. It's anticipated that these requirements will effectively encourage a race to the top, as reporting entities compete for market share, investor funding and consumer support. If any business fails in its obligation to report and take action, there can be little doubt that they would be punished by the court of public opinion and suffer a consumer backlash, far worse than a dodgy TripAdvisor report could ever deliver, tarnishing their reputation and thereby threatening their bottom line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Counter to the Labor Party's declared view, this bill does not seek to introduce punitive penalties for noncompliance. Consistent feedback to the government during the consultation period strongly suggests that market pressure and reputational risk would be far more effective in driving compliance. In many respects the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 has sought to follow similar, highly effective legislation introduced into the United Kingdom in 2015, making it mandatory to disclose modern slavery risks and declare what actions have been taken or will be taken to address those risks. All modern slavery statements must include: specific information about the entity's structure, operations and supply chain; potential modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains; actions taken to address these risks, including due diligence and remediation processes; and how the entity is assessing the effectiveness of their actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a further commitment, to support a market mechanism to combat modern slavery, the coalition government has committed $3.6 million in the 2018 budget to establish a dedicated modern slavery business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs to advise and support businesses to comply with their obligations. The Morrison government will also make sure that detailed guidance and awareness-raising materials are made available for businesses before the reporting requirement comes into force. This guidance will be drafted in consultation with experts from business and civil society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is specifically targeted to deliberately disrupt morally corrupt business models that rely on modern slavery and seek profit in Australia. At the same time, the reporting mechanism that the proposed legislation will set in place will, as has been the experience in the United Kingdom, heighten awareness of this global crisis. There can be no doubt that modern slavery is a major violation of human rights and a deplorable crime against humanity that can no longer be tolerated, and it should under no circumstances be ignored. It's for these reasons I'm very happy to commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  While the slave trade and slavery were outlawed across the Western world in the 19th century, slavery did not end in the 19th century. Instead, the face of modern slavery is women forced into prostitution, men forced to work in agriculture and construction and children enslaved in sweatshops. The Walk Free Foundation estimates that more than 40 million people are victims of modern slavery. That's more than 40 million of the most horrific human rights abuses possible. That's about 33 million people more than were enslaved during the history of the transatlantic slave trade in the 19th century. The more than 40 million victims of modern slavery include about 10 million children, nearly 25 million people in forced labour, more than 15 million people in forced marriage and nearly five million people in forced sexual exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a problem that is distant for Australia. It is mostly happening in our region. About two-thirds of modern slavery victims are in the Asia-Pacific. For instance, the Walk Free Foundation's global slavery index suggests that more than one in 100 people living in India are enslaved. Many of the victims are slaves trapped in global supply chains of products and services that Australians use every day. Australia must be a part of the efforts to stamp out this heinous practice for the benefit of people living in our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia itself is not immune from the scourge of slavery. It is happening in our own communities. There have been more than 600 referrals over the last 14 years to the Australian Federal Police for modern slavery practices right here in Australia. This ought to shock all Australians. The Walk Free Foundation believes that there are 4,300 people who are currently trapped in modern slavery in Australia without a voice and without the strong legal protections that they need to escape. An effective modern slavery act is desperately needed for Australia to help fight the battle against the scourge of modern slavery, which afflicts so many around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At our core, Labor is a party for workers and their rights. That is our very reason for being. Fighting exploitation of workers and abuses of human rights have always been central to the Labor mission. It's why we are in politics and in parliament in the first place. We will always be on the side of workers, whether they live in Western Australia or West Bengal. When it comes to modern slavery, one of the challenges is that slavery is deliberately kept in the dark and will continue to be hidden unless concerted efforts are made to expose it. Sunlight is the best disinfectant to tackle this disease. This is why last year Labor did the policy legwork to come up with a serious policy to tackle modern slavery. We took the lead in talking with business, civil society and the union movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU and the Salvation Army, we announced that Labor was committed to establishing a modern slavery act to mandate transparency in supply chains with meaningful penalties for noncompliance, along with the appointment of an independent antislavery commissioner. Labor's policy, being equipped with the right penalties and oversight, would ensure that no Australian company is either directly or indirectly engaged in modern slavery. We'd do this by ensuring that major Australian companies report on the steps that they have taken to ensure that their business is not involved in slavery or human trafficking in their supply chain. This will be publicly available so that everyone can keep these companies accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that slavery really should be above politics. We acknowledge that the government has brought forward the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 after some pressure from the Labor side of politics and the shadow minister, the member for Hotham, as well as parliamentary committees, representatives from civil society, businesses and unions. However, Labor does have three outstanding problems with the bill before the House: (1) the government has not included penalties for companies that breach the act; (2) it has included a business engagement unit rather than an independent antislavery commissioner; and (3) it includes forced marriage, which will likely have unintended consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The act needs penalties to make sure that companies are transparent about where their products and services are coming from. Penalties are an essential part of making sure that the act can be effective at stamping out modern slavery. We should not be aiming for a compliance regime that is toothless. While Labor understands that the business community shares our vision to eradicate modern slavery, penalties are an effective way to keep business accountable. The royal commission into the banks and financial services companies is a timely reminder that we cannot always trust that business will act in the best interests of the community, including by complying with the law. The lack of penalties for big business is unsurprising from this government. It's a government that's done everything it can to run a protection racket for big business and, in particular, the big banks. In the United Kingdom, where a similar bill without penalties was implemented, three years after the act's implementation only about half of the 9,000 to 11,000 organisations that are required to report have produced a slavery and human trafficking statement. This is not an outcome that we should be seeking to replicate in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the severity of the problem, it's simply not good enough for companies to be able to opt out of fighting human rights violations and exploitations that they are involved in. Combatting slavery should not be optional. We shouldn't lower our standards. Stamping out slavery should not be an opt in. Companies that make money in Australia have a moral and community obligation to be open about where their products and services are coming from. The community needs to have confidence that, when they get to the counter to pay, they are not propping up companies that rely on slave labour. Consumers and voters have a right to know what steps the companies are taking to stamp out slavery. Penalties for noncompliance make this right effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalties give companies a reason to conduct investigations into themselves and to find out whether, even indirectly, they could be involved in modern slavery. This makes their business more ethical and more sustainable. As Oxfam pointed out in their submission into the Senate inquiry into this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is strong precedent for penalties for non-compliance to be a part of the Australian Act. The recently passed Modern Slavery Act in New South Wales provides for a penalty of up to 10,000 penalty points (over $A1 million) for businesses operating in NSW who do not comply or provide false or misleading statements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no reason for the Commonwealth to take a weaker stance on modern slavery than New South Wales. The majority of the experts who gave evidence to the Senate committee on this matter, such as the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia and Oxfam, all wanted penalties to be a part of this bill. We should listen to the experts. This is why we will be moving amendments to introduce penalties for noncompliance as part of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, instead of another lapdog for big business—the business engagement unit that is currently part of the bill—we need an independent commissioner for accountability. The independent commissioner is needed to work with victims, to field inquiries and to follow up complaints. The independent commissioner is needed to monitor and scrutinise the government's work. The independent commissioner is needed to work with all organisations to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia and in supply chains. The independent commissioner is also needed to lead Australia's global efforts to fight slavery, including working with other countries and international organisations. What we don't need is another government funded cheerleader for big business. It speaks to the values and priorities of the current government—all about the top end of town rather than protecting the human rights of the most vulnerable and exploited. It has been estimated that there are around 4,300 victims of slavery in Australia, but, as Senate estimates has revealed, only seven convictions have been recorded for slavery in half a decade. We need a step-change with how this issue is handled to put a blow torch on the people and organisations that perpetuate this sickening crime here and abroad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An independent commissioner is needed because victims are often extremely vulnerable. They need an independent body to turn to. We need an independent body to help fill in the gaps in enforcement and support services victims of modern slavery can fall into. The establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner has widespread support from organisations such as the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans, Anti Slavery Australia and the ACTU. Victims of slavery deserve so much more than a big business support unit; they deserve an independent advocate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we are also concerned that forced marriage is captured by this bill. We don't agree that forced marriage should be one of the forms of exploitation that business is required to report on. Why? Requiring businesses to investigate the married circumstances of their employees, contractors and suppliers risks driving forced marriage underground. Why? Under this government, we have not had a single successful prosecution of the forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Victims have limited civil protections and struggle to access government funded support. Putting the onus on business to investigate is going to make it even harder for forced marriage to be discovered. As Good Shepherd put it in their submission to the Senate inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… corporate responsibility lies with supporting the wellbeing of individuals impacted by violence, not in identification and reporting on violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor recognises there is a serious problem in Australia's response to forced marriage. Victims have limited civil protections and struggle to access government funded support. Labor is committed to establishing forced marriage protection orders and to increasing funding for civil society, the establishment of a forced marriage unit to provide a one-stop-shop to connect victims to support services and government agencies, and assistance for Australians who have been taken overseas to be married against their will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also committed to removing the cooperation requirement, which means that victims who wish to access government funded support must agree to cooperate with law enforcement. This requirement is damaging as, often, children and other victims of forced marriage must testify against their own family in order to access vital government support. The government's announced limited trial to improve support services doesn't go far enough. So we again urge the government to match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment instead of driving forced marriage further underground, as we expect it to be an unintended consequence of the provisions in these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Modern Slavery Bill is a great concept, a great principle, and I congratulate the government for engaging on this issue, but it can be better. It needs penalties, it needs an independent commissioner and it does not need to drive forced marriage further underground. Labor will not stop fighting for an effective antislavery bill and, as I mentioned earlier, we will move amendments to try and improve the substance of this bill. So, on this note, I support the bill but urge the government to reconsider on these matters.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  The weighty chains of slavery hunch us all. That is the basis upon which I am an emphatic supporter of measures to stop the challenges of  modern slavery. The very foundation of the idea that the individual is sovereign over their own lives and has the freedom to choose their life, their opportunity and their enterprise is fundamental to the values those who sit on this side of the chamber hold dear. Some of us will never give up the pursuit of that noble cause and for it to be achieved for all people. That's why modern slavery must be tackled, and that is what this bill seeks to do. It seeks to do it in a cautious way in the sense that we understand that we cannot always do everything and change every circumstance beyond our borders but that, as a nation, we have a responsibility to be able to do what we can do to snuff out the practice and where it has a connection directly to this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that modern slavery continues to devastate the lives of millions of people around the globe. The most recent global estimate of the extent of modern slavery is that on any given day around 40 million people are victims of modern slavery, and that's through debt bondage, servitude, forced marriage, forced labour and human trafficking. Each one of those suffocates the lives of those people who experience it. It's a sobering human tragedy for so many people being denied fundamental social and economic freedoms to be able to decide their own destinies. These victims are exploited in a range of different industries and sectors, including agriculture and aquaculture, mining, construction, fashion and electronics. The government has one of the strongest responses to combat human trafficking and slavery around the world, delivered under the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery 2015-19. Since then, Australia has identified and supported more than 375 suspected victims and convicted 21 offenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery distorts global markets. It undercuts responsible business practices and poses significant legal and reputational risks for companies who may be unwillingly or unintentionally the beneficiaries of its consequences. That's why companies have to be part of tackling this challenge. Voluntary action on these matters should always be encouraged. I know that many businesses across the world take it upon themselves, without those in this parliament telling them, to stand up and do what they can do, through their supply chains, to snuff out modern slavery. And when companies provide supply chain reports and details on the source of their goods and labour and services, and then report it through certification standards, it enables consumers to make informed choices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also raises awareness and visibility of the challenges faced from modern slavery. In its consultation paper, the Australian government proposed to provide clear and detailed guidance and awareness-raising materials for the business community. That includes providing companies with reporting templates, best practice examples and information about how best the business community can remedy and report instances of modern slavery identified in their supply chains or their operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're very mindful of what other countries and other governments are doing in this space. It has helped guide us and inform our approach as a government. Along with the United Kingdom, Australia is supporting a range of measures to combat modern slavery internationally through engagement with regional partners. This bill fits as part of that important framework. It's an important part of the framework by having reporting requirements for some businesses large enough to do so. It sends a clear message that this crime is unacceptable in the supply chain of goods and services to the benefit of Australians. It requires annual statements from Australian entities, including corporate Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth companies, with annual revenue of $100 million or more, foreign entities with the same annual revenue, and the Australian government. The disclosure process will be fully transparent and publicly accessible, and it fits, as I said, as part of our regional role in combatting human trafficking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only other remark I want to make is why I think it is a sensible and a pragmatic approach the government is taking not to include a separate commissioner. The reason is we actually have a commissioner whose job it is to stand up for the human rights of Australians and to play a role in terms of our relationship to the world. It's the office of the Australian Human Rights Commission. I'm obviously familiar with that position, having served in it previously. The idea that we need to go off and set up another commission to do the job of an office that already exists, frankly, seems wasteful. It would be a much more efficient use of public resources if we put it within the framework of the Australian Human Rights Commission, an organisation that is already tasked and chartered with these objectives. Frankly, it would enhance the standing and stature of the Human Rights Commission by tackling these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are people on the other side of this chamber at the moment who are being snarky about those remarks, and they're free to do so. Because, in the end, one of the biggest problems—</span>

                    </a>  I'm not surprised by their complete indifference to human rights. You may recall that one of the reasons I was appointed as Australia's Human Rights Commissioner was because they didn't appoint one. For years they left the office empty. It was open. It was left for somebody to come along and do the job, but then, of course, the coalition government came in and what did they do? They appointed a Human Rights Commissioner to deal with these issues—</span>

For those people on the other side of the chamber to lecture people on this side of the chamber about human rights, when they didn't even fill the office—it was their job to fill it when they were in government—shows the blatant hypocrisy and grandstanding that they engage in.</span>

You know that this is an issue that touches all of us because it is one of those cases of 'there but for the grace of God go I'. Slavery is a curse and breeds in darkness—let there be light.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  That was fantastic! Thank you, the member for Goldstein! He always takes the bait. There are technical differences, of course, between human trafficking, forced labour, domestic servitude, sex trafficking and modern slavery, but the crux of modern slavery—the umbrella term for these crimes—is a situation where a victim is forced, coerced or defrauded into working for the benefit of the perpetrator. Everyone should be free. I agree with the member for Goldstein's statements. Everyone should be free from such kinds of forced fraud and coercion. Everyone should have the right to benefit from their own labour. That may sound simple, but it's all too often overlooked in real life and in our culture. I can illustrate the essence of slavery with some fairytales which we would have been told as kids. Cinderella, Rapunzel and Oliver Twist—who we're all familiar with—were all victims of modern slavery. Cinderella was forced to cook and clean for free. Rapunzel was deceived into staying captive in order for her captor to exploit the magical properties of her hair. Oliver Twist was a child whose vulnerabilities were exploited by criminals for selfish gain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the parliament has an opportunity to properly recognise modern-day victims living real lives of modern slavery akin to the fairytales. Labor, of course, will not stand in the way of this bill, but two things are important to note at the outset. The first point is that we should recognise the work of the member for Hotham and, indeed, the federal Labor Party for leading the way on this. I attended roundtables with business stakeholders, union stakeholders and workers long before the government got on board and made a commitment to this legislation. The second point is that, while it's a worthy start, it can be improved and it doesn't go far enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the fairytales I mentioned, many victims do not live happily ever after, and some do not live long at all. They are forced, coerced and defrauded until they're unable to work for the perpetrators anymore, or until they die. Perpetrators are in the business of profiting off the lives of vulnerable people. In the case of sex trafficking, many victims do not live for more than seven years. To help these modern-day Cinderellas or Rapunzels, governments across the world need to act together, collectively. Unfortunately, Australia's government are doing this in a half-hearted way. The government are stopping short, because they simply can't bring themselves to say no to anything that big business asks of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our chance to put in place a framework to protect people in Australia and overseas from the most horrific forms of exploitation. Even today, across the world, perpetrators continue to avoid detection by exploiting the vulnerabilities of victims by keeping them voiceless. These victims are voiceless because they are hidden deep within the labyrinth of complex global supply chains. It's no exaggeration to say that these forms of extreme exploitation are truly the darkest, hidden aspects of globalisation and capitalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The power imbalance is extreme. The victims are mostly women, girls, children, the poor and those without privilege or living in countries without the rule of law on one hand and they're up against enormous multinational companies with millions or billions of annual revenue on the other hand. This is a recipe for suffering and exploitation of the weakest, the most vulnerable people, in the most extreme way. Shockingly, this has become the norm, they estimate, for more than 40 million people worldwide. More than 40 million people worldwide live in these extreme, inhuman conditions. That's far more than Australia's entire population. Australians may be surprised, though, to learn that even here there are victims. The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are thousands of victims hidden and suffering here in Australia—on farms in Australia, in factories in our suburbs, in kitchens down the street, in ordinary neighbourhoods in every major city.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing this inequality has resonated with so many in Australia and in this House because it resonates with Australian values—a fair go. So an act which shines light on complex and hidden supply chains not only in Australia but also across the world and the region provides the opportunity for political and corporate leadership—a rare opportunity at the moment for a race to the top, if you like, when the parliament has spent so much time this term debating the race to the bottom in multinational regulation, corporate tax and so on. A strong regime can do much to foster better labour standards in Australia and wherever Australian companies do business. But, to be effective, we need strong political and corporate leadership. Labor, as I said, led this debate. We committed to it before the government got on board. The government have meandered along slowly but they have got partway there. But I'll touch on our concerns about the regime in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do observe that we as privileged people may expect and even take for granted that our institutions work as they should. We generally feel safe in our rule of law. This is, however, not the case in many places where large numbers of people live in deep poverty, with governments which are unable or unwilling to protect their wellbeing—hence, their extreme vulnerability is ripe for exploitation. In a globalised world, we cannot be present at the scene of the crime. We can't help a woman forced by debt bondage to work in a sweatshop making clothes we may buy, but we can make sure that the company which sells the clothes takes steps to ensure that all subcontractors pay a fair wage. We can't help an individual child being exploited in a village plantation picking produce for export, but we can make sure that Australian companies ensure that no child labour is used in the harvesting of their produce, and report accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a modern globalised world, it's only fair that sizeable companies should be expected, indeed required, to ask questions about their supply chains, to be actively curious, to audit, to not just say, 'We didn't know,' and, when they find problems, to take steps to clean it up. Morally, we cannot expect the poorest people in the world—the woman or the child in the examples I have given—to be able to exert change in their situations. It's just impossible. So we must do something for those people from whom we profit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country's biggest and best companies do business throughout the world. They have supply chains which cover all kinds of inputs in a plethora of industries which reach right into these villages, forests, plantations, factories, workshops and fisheries in distant places. We can provide these companies with both a responsibility and a mandate to shed more light and bring some hope into places where we may otherwise never know where to even begin looking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is fair to say that the moral case is agreed by all members of this chamber—government members, opposition members and, I guess, members of the crossbench.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, in order to be successful in addressing a problem, it is common sense to match the treatment with the problem; it makes sense to match the treatment with the nature of the disease. Human trafficking is an endemic problem which requires a holistic solution. It has not and will not respond to partial or quick-fix, politically convenient solutions. I pay tribute to an intern and, indeed, a friend who has assisted me with some of the thinking on this who in his previous life headed the modern slavery coalition in the Asia-Pacific, based out of Malaysia, and who pointed me to a lot of work that he's done over many years: Daniel Lo. He said that the experts recommend efforts across the four Ps. First is prevention: keep the victims out of harm. Second is prosecution: get the bad guys. Third is protection: help victims when we find them. Fourth is partnership: work together because it is complex and there is a lot of work to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The modern slavery act is just one piece of the puzzle. Yet, rather than learning from both global and local experts, the government has decided to go unnecessarily soft on big business. I say 'unnecessarily' and I'll explain why. I believe the act should include penalties for noncompliance and that it's not as controversial as some may think. It is a no-brainer, really. If we're unequivocally serious about stepping up and stamping out modern slavery, as we hear we all are, and about ensuring businesses actually look at their supply chains and report on them, there have to be penalties for noncompliance. Penalties hold companies accountable because they're in the best position to address the transparency of their own supply chains. Why shouldn't a company benefiting from global trade of over $100 million annually contribute to the clean-up of the global system? Personally, I believe that most businesses subject to this act will want to comply and will comply. For most businesses, common decency alone but also the corporate reputation risks of course will drive serious efforts to comply. Companies don't want to get caught out having dodgy supply chains now; it'll wreck their reputation, and they'll lose customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was involved in some of Labor's consultations, led by the member for Hotham, on modern slavery policy with big business, and I do not believe there's actually great concern. If you talk to them privately outside the chamber—not what they might say in the submissions—there's not really major concern about the idea of putting penalties in, because they intend to comply anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, sadly, we've also learnt through the royal commission into the banks—the one that the current, temporary Prime Minister voted 27 times to stop and oppose and said was a stunt—that businesses don't always do what they ought to do, not even what they have to. And so, accordingly, the focus must be at the top. Customers can reasonably expect companies have complied and the focus of regulation, but it must be on the CEO and the board, not consumers. And so it's entirely reasonable that, with such a serious issue, if we're serious as a parliament about saying that businesses have to audit their supply chains, have to take responsibility for it and have to address failings when they find them, there are penalties available not for trivial misconduct, not for oversights, not for things which people are consciously trying to fix but for serious misconduct. There should be penalties available. The government should really rethink this aspect and get serious on it. I don't believe it's as controversial as some may make out, and they could address that in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second deficiency in Labor's view and in my view is that this act should include an antislavery commissioner. I met last year with the UK modern slavery commissioner put in place with their act. A commissioner would work both across and within that four-P paradigm which I laid out. They are such complex and difficult issues to address, and a specialist commissioner with sufficient resources would be essential to ensuring that this complex problem is properly addressed. For example, the antislavery commissioner would be key in addressing the gaps and weaknesses in our protection framework once victims are recognised and rescued. The framework requires a high level of coordination as it involves law enforcement, government agencies and civil society organisations, not to mention reciprocal states if the victim is from another country. The UK slavery act already lists 36 different statements from Australian companies such as Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Wesfarmers. Corporate leaders are already reporting. This is not new. But the reporting framework under the Modern Slavery Act in the UK hasn't worked as it does not penalise companies that fail to report. For example, 61 per cent of surveyed UK statements did not comply with the requirement of a CEO signature on the statement. The UK antislavery commissioner has demonstrated enormous practical engagement across business and government sectors to stamp out modern slavery. This kind of practical work would clearly be beyond the business engagement unit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's difficult to understand, on reflection, what the rant from the member for Goldstein about his previous life as the Human Rights Commissioner of Australia was really about. It was entertaining but it's still difficult to understand what it had to do with the debate at hand. It's not actually the government's proposal that this thing be enforced from there. He does take every opportunity, as Deputy Speaker Vasta and I both know—we've sat through this—to remind everyone that he was Australia's Human Rights Commissioner. He did provide in his speech to the parliament an explanation as to why he was appointed and tried to make it relevant. Others have a different view: that the former Attorney-General was playing an April Fools Day joke on the Human Rights Commission, hence his appointment. But that's a matter for debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government proposes to leave it to the Department of Home Affairs. I wouldn't trust that mob to run a chook raffle if their performance on visa processing, citizenship processing, contract management or any basic administrative function is anything to go by. It's difficult to think of any other department that has a worse performance record. I'm the deputy chair of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee, and we have the department through and we look at their audit reports and their performance. Their basic performance as an entity of government administration is appalling. I simply cannot accept that is an acceptable home. The case for a commissioner who is serious about this is strong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I believe corporate leaders are willing to lead in this area. It can, as I said, be a race to the top if we do this right. I praise both trade unions and big business in broad terms for getting behind the concept and saying that we have to deal with our global supply chains and take this seriously. The government has followed, not led, but it's there or partially there. But, like with everything else now, its heart just doesn't seem to be in it. The government can pick up some of the points in this debate and give them further thought when the bill reaches the Senate, because there are more procedures that can be followed.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  I'm really pleased to rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. I'm very pleased that the coalition government is implementing this bill. The word 'slavery' conjures up images of Africans in chains. To many, slavery is thought of in terms of historic events—the things you learn about in school. Slavery has been a defining part of history for many countries around the world. We think of the battles fought to have slavery abolished and of those individuals who were brave enough to stand up to stamp out forced labour and slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute today to William Wilberforce, a former English parliamentarian who, in the 1800s, led the movement to stop slavery and fought very strongly for that. He was a great man who had a great Christian faith and believed in the importance of faith, morality and education. He resigned from parliament due to ill-health and died just three days after seeing the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 pass through the parliament. He was a prime example of someone putting faith into action and making a positive change in parliament to end slavery. Today many of us think of the 1800s and the abhorrent conditions that people used to be subject to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians are blissfully unaware that slavery still exists, in higher numbers than any of us would be willing to admit. Sadly, slavery is rife in industries around the world. I know Australians would be shocked to realise how many products that we use every day are touched by modern slaves. Every day we're all worried about, for example, how much battery power our smartphones have. We rely on rechargeable batteries more and more, and companies use their battery usage as a selling point to get us to buy their products. Cobalt is a key component of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, which are used in our smartphones, laptops and cars. Most of the supply of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A 2016 report from Amnesty International found that children as young as seven were being used as slave labour in the Democratic Republic of the Congo mining trade. The children were expected to work some 10 to 12 hours a day and received as little as US$1 or US$2 per day. The sad reality is that the likelihood that my smartphone wasn't touched in some way by a slave is pretty low.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you're playing soccer for your local team or just kicking the ball around with your children, if someone asked you where that ball was made, you'd assume that China would have had some part in its manufacturing, and you'd probably be correct. What you wouldn't know is that soccer ball manufacturers in China can work up to 21 hours a day for a month straight making soccer balls.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we are getting dressed in the morning, we never stop to think about the approximately 1.4 million children who are forced to work in Uzbek cotton fields. To put that into perspective, that's almost 3½ times the entire population of the Moreton Bay region. The Moreton Bay Regional Council is one of the councils in my seat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some examples of the many industries that are riddled with slave labour. It is hiding in our fashion, manufacturing and construction industries. I'm glad that, as a government, we're doing something to try and reduce it. According to the Australian Human Rights Law Centre, there are around 25 million slaves worldwide and almost 4,300 modern slaves in Australia. Of course, it would be great if this number could be zero, period. This bill will hopefully go a long way towards reducing that number of slaves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with constituents of mine Judith Newton and Steven Peirce, who are fierce advocates for legislation to help curb modern slavery. I want to thank Judith and Steven for their time and for talking to me about the impacts that modern slavery has on our world every day. Whilst this bill won't address all of their concerns, it's a great start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery is a multidimensional issue. This bill primarily focuses on forced labour and the ways in which we can do our part to shut down this evil trade and ensure that those who are enforcing inhumane conditions are cut out of Australian business supply chains. The establishment of a modern slavery reporting requirement is the first step towards shining a light into the shadows of the supply chains where modern slavery thrives. We are leading the way. The federal government will consider possible modern slavery risks in our own procurement too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But businesses need to know that this isn't just another box to tick; this is part of their responsibilities to their customers to implement fair and humane practices. The demand for cheaper products isn't a good enough excuse to even come close to justifying modern slavery. Companies which have $100 million in consolidated revenue will be required to annually report their modern slavery statements. They will need to report on identifying their key modern slavery risks and describe their actions to address these risks. These criteria will make it easier for businesses to understand their responsibilities in reporting and allow for consistency across all statements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's most important about this bill, though, is the transparency element. The statements will be freely available online through a dedicated register. This is a world-leading initiative to allow consumers the ability to judge companies on their actions and responsibilities as leaders in the modern world. As a nation, we pride ourselves on being leaders in the free world. We demand and deserve freedom, humanity, equality and fairness in what we do, and that should be prevalent in all aspects of business, no matter how big the job is in a large-scale business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is essential. This is what politicians are supposed to do. We're here to make legislation to help impact peoples' lives for the better. We are ensuring that large businesses and medium sized businesses identify modern slavery risks in their supply chains and do their part to stamp out the modern slavery footprint in Australia. I'm proud to be part of the government that's putting Australians first. This bill will have a monumental impact on ensuring that our business sector is fair, humane and also viable going forward. It's a great day for Australian history, and I'm proud to speak on this bill today.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on this important bill before the House, the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, and to support amendments moved by the member for Hotham in this regard. The idea that slavery is some kind of shameful artefact from our deep historical past, of less civilised times, is something that is very prevalent in popular imagination. It is thought that slavery is something that was left behind us long ago. But the reality is that there are now more slaves today than at any other time in human history. That is a very sobering thought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is estimated that there are 45.8 million people who are living in slavery or slave-like conditions around the world. Our region is amongst the worst. It is critical that this parliament steps up to show a leadership role in this regard because modern slavery, as I said, is so prevalent in our region. It is estimated that two-thirds of people living in the Asia-Pacific are impacted. That is a terrifying thought. According to the Global Slavery Index of 2018, an estimated 15,000 are right here in Australia. This is not something that belongs to other foreign lands. This is not someone else's problem. We have a very deep, profound issue in our own nation that needs to be addressed. It has spread its exploitive tentacles throughout our society. The people who care for your children, clean your office, make your clothes or serve your food could all be victims of modern slavery, hidden in plain sight. That is indeed a point that was made again and again during the parliamentary inquiry which I was very privileged to be a part of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Places like the UK, France, California and the EU have already introduced legislation to protect people from these appalling practices, and it's now time for us in Australia to take strong action ourselves. The shocking truth is that Australia currently has no formal mechanism that directly targets modern slavery in business operations or supply chains. We cannot go on in that way. This is why Labor has a modern slavery policy which includes supply chain reporting requirements and penalties for noncompliance. That is an essential part of any successful Modern Slavery Act, and that is an issue I will return to. Something that bothers me and my colleagues on this side of the House enormously is the lack of penalties for breaches in the current legislation. If we have learnt anything from the UK model, which much of this was based on, we should have been very alive to the fact that the absence of penalties is profoundly problematic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, as I said, we are very committed to forcing the business community to investigate risk in their supply chains. Another very critical component that is sadly lacking in this bill is the establishment of an Australian independent antislavery commissioner. Again, I'll come to some points as to why that is so essential. The fact is that there are two gaping holes in this legislation: the lack of penalties and the lack of an independent antislavery commissioner. These are very problematic components of this bill. It will take a Labor government to improve this bill, and exactly that will be our intention, should we get to serve on the government benches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House today—I don't wish to take away from the government—is an important first step; it's just not going far enough. The reasons why you would insist upon an independent antislavery commissioner, for example, is that the business engagement unit that the government proposes in this legislation is really going to have a very strong focus on the business community and the assistance that can be provided there, whereas the role of an independent antislavery commissioner is a much broader role than just liaising with the business community. We would regard that commissioner as having very important functions to support victims of these modern slavery practices. The commissioner's role will be very much to work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery as it occurs in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's important because there are practices of it here. I see my colleague the member for Lingiari is here in the chamber. He and I have taken evidence in another unrelated inquiry that exposes practices that should absolutely come under the umbrella of this modern slavery act, but they will not. Without an independent commissioner, there is no pathway for those people to go on to talk about the shocking arrangements that are taking place. Some Indigenous artists in Australia are being asked to practice in a manner that, by any measure, would be regarded as extremely exploitative if not part of what we would now deem to be modern-day slavery. This is an example, without going into the detail of those cases, where people, either against their will or without informed consent, are being asked to participate in a work situation that is nothing short of a sweatshop in order to paint their way out of debt. That is right here in our country today. This legislation, as it currently is drafted, will not help those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an example of why we need to move these amendments and why I'm here strongly supporting the amendments moved by Labor. This bill needs to be improved, and it should be improved. I would love the government to accept the amendments, and perhaps this is an opportunity for them to have a change of heart and think: 'This is a good first step, but we can make this bill better. Let's work with Labor to do that.' I would love to hear the minister come back in and put that to the House. That's because, in its current form, the bill is disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a lot of concern about responses and reactions from the big business community towards this new kind of reporting regime. I take that on board, but we should be providing the necessary supports there for businesses to be able to report in open and transparent ways around the way they do business and, indeed, the way they do business across their entire supply chains. Yes, let's help guide and nurture businesses through those new reporting regimes, but let's also be very explicit in the provision of support and backing for people who find themselves firmly embedded in modern slavery practices both here in Australia and abroad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absence of penalties, as I said, really should have been dealt with before this legislation came to this House. The need for penalties has absolutely been one of the key lessons we should learn from the UK experience. But we've squibbed it. The government has squibbed it. I would argue that the absence of the penalties in this legislation means that in the three years since the act's enactment—sorry, back in the UK this was the lesson that we learnt: only half of the 9,000 to 11,000 organisations that the UK government estimates are required to report have actually produced a slavery and human trafficking statement. You're getting about 50 per cent compliance when you have no penalties in place. If they don't comply, you've got no mechanisms there to ensure that you reach your target. You're aiming for 100 per cent compliance here, but in the absence of these penalties you're getting approximately 50 per cent of people even being prepared to undertake the reporting process, which they are completely obliged to do. Without the penalties, that's what happens, so I will predict that that's exactly what you will see in Australia as well. That really is, in my view, squibbing the issue. It's going soft in the area of human rights, which, given the intent of this bill, should be front and centre of our reckoning and ensuring that peoples' human rights are being observed, being protected and being nurtured. That's why Labor has moved its amendment to introduce penalties, so as to ensure that this legislation's got the teeth it needs to do its job, frankly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, I sat on the committee that did a lot of the work examining what a modern slavery act might look like. We heard from a lot of stakeholders giving evidence during that period, and the vast, vast majority of people who gave evidence in that inquiry called for strong enforcement compliance mechanisms. They were very much in favour of penalties if people weren't complying in meeting their obligations. Oxfam told the committee that without the penalties in place:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there is a real risk that companies will not report under the Act. This would severely undermine the effectiveness of the Act and the goal to help eliminate modern slavery in supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That kind of evidence was repeated time and time again. The Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria made similar observations, and argued that the competition for funding and support alone won't give profit-driven businesses the incentive that they would need in a competitive market to investigate and disclose their supply chain. They are real concerns about the capacity for this legislation to live up to expectations. I think the government have very real expectations here, but they think everybody's going to play nice and, without penalties in place, they will get everybody on board and doing the right thing. History would suggest otherwise. Indeed, the experience in the UK is a very, very clear demonstration of why you need those penalties in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for an independent antislavery commissioner is also a lesson we should have learnt from others. Victims of slavery in Australia absolutely deserve more than just a business engagement unit. That is not good enough. They deserve somebody who can monitor and scrutinise progress, work with victims, civil society and international organisations to prevent, detect and respond to slavery. That's what Labor proposes: someone who is independent, who can stand up for human rights violations in this country and who can give voice to the voiceless. If a modern slavery act cannot do that, then it fails its first test. That is why I stand to support Labor's amendment and strongly urge the government to support it as well.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  I rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018 and, like many of the speakers before me, I want to speak about actions that we need to take and have taken in our own backyard. As many of the people in this House know, including my good colleague the member for Cowper, who has been along for the fight, we have fought constantly for the last five years to crack down on exploitation, particularly of foreign workers, visa holders and those who are receiving cash payments in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our regional areas, that is predominantly within the agricultural sector. Inside the agricultural sector, it is mainly in horticulture. The reasons for it are very simple. The reason those who are out there, mostly labour hire contractors, wish to take the risk is money. They can make an awful lot of money if they do not pay their employees. Can I say from the outset that the overwhelming majority of our local growers and Australian producers are doing the right thing. They are doing the right thing. Unfortunately, they get bunched in with the bad seeds who are out there not doing the right thing with regard to employees or with regard to the people who they pay to work on their farms, to pick their produce and to keep their businesses operational. For me personally, this has been a long, long battle. We have been incredibly successful in working with the government over recent years to deliver things which crack down on this exploitation and which make a real difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the horticulture sector, the way they make their money through the exploitation of workers is quite simple. In the horticulture sector, if you turn out 2,000 cartons a day and your margin can improve by $2 a box, that is $4,000 seven days a week. There's $28,000 straight up. You're automatically more competitive than your next-door neighbour who's doing the right thing. It is not just about the exploitation of workers but it is also about the level playing field for our agricultural producers. Without them, we cannot feed the world and we cannot feed our own people. I want to point out the duopoly once again. The purchasing practices of Coles and Woolworths allow this to happen, because they take the cheaper price, and that sets the platform. If you cannot compete, you don't sell your product and—it's pretty straightforward—you go broke, you lose your house and you lose your farm. I can understand that there are those out there who are willing to take the risk, because for them it's about survival. We need to make sure that there is balance. We need to make sure that everyone in this country is paid appropriately and that they are not exploited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll diverge slightly, because I note with interest the most recent ACCC report into electricity, in terms of pricing, and the recommendation for divestiture. I think that is something which should be supported not just in the electricity sector but right across the board. If you have a market monopoly power and you are using that power to the detriment of your suppliers, the government should crack down on you. It has been the case with Coles and Woolworths on many occasions that they have acted inappropriately and have supported the continuation of this type of exploitation. I think that is just wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the points I wanted to show is the case of one Emmanuel Bani. This is a case that has been settled and is in the public domain. Mr Bani employed 22 individuals from Vanuatu in the period 21 July 2014 to 11 September 2014. Mr Bani left those individuals on the side of the road with no passports, with no money and with no payment for that entire period. In fact, on arrival at Helidon, they were dropped off without food, without cash and with nothing to do for three days until he showed up later on. As I've said, this is all a matter of the public record. It was done at considerable expense by Maroochy Sunshine over that period. Every single one of them was a citizen and resident of Vanuatu.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons I raise this case is the fact that these gentlemen, and of course their support network through Jeff Smith and a South Sea Islander association in Bundaberg, ended up in my office. We met with these gentlemen. They were left with absolutely nothing. It was a horrible experience for them. I am ashamed of our country that this happened to these individuals. It should not have been allowed. The Fair Work Commission has cracked down on Mr Bani. There has been a fine of over $200,000. But we need to ensure there are no more Mr Banis in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence that was given is stark and startling. Mr Aru gave evidence that he did not always have food to eat. Sometimes for lunch he would have half a sandwich, but on other occasions he had no food. On some days he did have food for dinner. He remembers cooking and eating some pumpkins and potatoes that employees had given him at Keller Farm for dinner, and that was all he had to eat that day. He felt hungry a lot of the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is unacceptable. This is the reason we are cracking down on these types of organisations. These are the reasons that we have the Modern Slavery Bill before the House. This cannot continue in the great nation of Australia. That's the reason I've been so passionate about it, as have my colleagues the member for Cowper, the senator for Queensland Barry O'Sullivan and a number of others who work in the agricultural area and who represent agricultural areas. We do not want this to continue. The evidence is just terrible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I won't continue on that; I will talk about what we've done. What we've done is that we've established Taskforce Cadena. Taskforce Cadena is a multijurisdictional task force across the board—AFP, ATO, local police, local governments—to crack down on these organisations which phoenix their companies and quite simply disappear. I know that I've seen plenty of proposals around from different organisations and different governments where they suggest that there should be a register of all of these local labour hire companies. But—can I say to you, Mr Speaker—that will make no difference at all, because it is only the people who are compliant who will register. It is just them. The others will continue to pay cash, and they'll continue to exploit these people. It is things like Taskforce Cadena which will crack down on this very, very poor behaviour, and I certainly commend the minister for its establishment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also provided an additional $20 million to Fair Work, which is necessary, but I think we need to approach this in a way which will be successful. That will require people on the ground because, as many of us in this room know, in terms of horticulture, it is very simple for people to go to a different paddock, with 300 workers for four hours, and then shift. It's really hard and very difficult to get hold of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I say also in support of the bill that this is clearly a good action. The government is putting forward a process to crack down on modern slavery in terms of this bill, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The petition has thousands of signatures and was presented to me by one of my constituents, David Forde, and by Professor Shahjahan Khan and Dr Mohammed Islam and others who drew it together. The petition requests the House to 'recognise the state of Palestine because, if the House is genuinely committed to a lasting two-state solution and advancing peace in the Middle East and beyond, then it must formally recognise the state of Palestine to ensure two sovereign states, based on the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions and international law'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It saddens me that millions of Palestinians continue to live under occupation or as refugees. The latest UNICEF situation report for Palestine reveals the dire living conditions of Palestinians. More than 80 per cent of the population are dependent on some form of assistance. There are 2.5 million people in need, most who call the Gaza Strip home. The security in that area is extremely fragile and unpredictable. Earlier this year, on 14 May, we saw the highest casualty toll in a single day since the 2014 hostilities were recorded: 60 Palestinians killed and 2,770 injured. Almost half of those killed and injured were by live ammunition. We now have three generations of refugees living in Gaza without any chance of economic capacity or having a decent standard of living. I applaud the efforts of David Forde and the wider Moreton community for bringing forward this petition, which I now table.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">TO THE HONOURABLE THE SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES It draws to the attention of the House, the following facts: That Palestinians are a stateless people who have suffered under the shadow of Israeli occupation for far too long. They want freedom, justice, equality and the right to self-determination. For 25 years, Palestinians have engaged in a rigged "peace process" while Israel has confiscated their lands, colonised their country with Jewish settlements and imposed a crippling blockade on Gaza that has pauperised its population. As Israel consolidates its hold over the Occupied Territories and the remaining Palestinian enclaves continue to shrink, the window of opportunity for a two-state solution is closing fast. The failure of the two-state solution will leave Israel as an apartheid state, ruling over an indigenous underclass of permanently disenfranchised Palestinians. Such a situation would destabilise the entire region and serve as an invaluable propaganda resource for extremist and terrorist organisations around the world. Given Israel's overwhelming political and military advantages, the Palestinians will never win their freedom and basic human rights without international intervention. . </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  It was great to be able to attend the official opening of St Agnes Catholic Primary School's new sports courts last week. Just two years ago I was at the school in Mt Gravatt announcing $211,000 to go towards the construction of three new multi-use courts at the school. How time flies! The courts will be used for after-school and weekend tennis, netball, basketball and volleyball program. It's not just the students and teachers of St Agnes who'll benefit from these courts; local families and sports groups will also be able to use them. The local community will be able to use the courts through programs conducted by Southside Tennis and St Agnes Netball Club. They will be working with groups such as TAG5, Cerebral Palsy League, Sporting Wheelies, disabled associations and Indigenous groups to conduct specially targeted sports programs for juniors, Indigenous, seniors, families and disabled people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to this government's investment, more children and families in the Mt Gravatt community will have better and more affordable access to recreational activities, helping them to lead a more active and healthy lifestyle. Overall, we expect there to be around 1,000 different users of these courts each year. It's all part of our commitment to invest in local communities to ensure everyone has access to a place where they can exercise and enjoy sport.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to providing fantastic new sports facilities that the school and the wider community will be able to use for years to come, I'm also pleased to report that this project benefitted the local economy during construction. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Tourism drives tremendous economic activity in these regional communities. Only last week I officially launched the FORM PUBLIC Silo Art Trail at the Newdegate Field Day. FORM have been transforming regional grain silos into gigantic, vibrant works of art, attracting visitors from all over Australia. The Ravensthorpe grain silo, featuring native animals endemic to the nearby Fitzgerald River National Park, has featured on a recent series of Australia Post stamps. This is only one of many projects funded through the government's regional development programs, including $4.5 million for the upgrade of the Middleton Beach foreshore in Albany; $1.2 million for the new Albany Visitors Centre; $980,000 for the restoration of the Gwalia timber mine head in Leonora; and $450,000 for the Norseman Cultural, Visitor and Community precinct. Next month I will be turning the first sod of the $6 million South West Energy Experience in Manjimup, which received a $2.7 million Building Better Regions Fund grant.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The nation, Western Australia and the people of Perth are grieving. A violent act in the suburb of Bedford in the electorate of Perth has at once torn apart and unified our community and the people of Australia. We will continue to hear very sad details on a daily basis, but what we know today is that our community is strong enough to unify in response to this tragedy. I know that every Australian sends love to the family members feeling immeasurable pain. 'There are no words to explain the emptiness and loss that we are feeling.' That is what Taryn said on the murder of her mother, her sister and three nieces, taken away from their family, from their community and from their future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence doesn't discriminate on your social status or where you live. It does discriminate on gender. When shocks like this occur, we naturally look for solutions. I don't want know that we have them today but I am going to take this opportunity to just share some information. If you need help escaping violence, please ask for it. Sometimes there is nothing braver or harder than to ask for help. Call 1800 RESPECT—1800737732. I will finish by thanking the Minister for Women for her remarks. On behalf of the House, I associate myself and the opposition with those remarks. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Hawkesbury River oysters are an iconic Australian delicacy, and I am extremely proud as the member for Berowra to represent the Hawkesbury River and several of the oyster growers who farm the river. Oyster farms on the Hawkesbury have suffered greatly in recent years, with their crops being struck firstly by the QX disease and then by Pacific oyster mortality syndrome. Both of these events have significantly reduced the number of oysters grown to maturity on the Hawkesbury. Hawkesbury River oyster farmers have persevered for several years while they rebuild their oyster stocks, maintaining their leases, diversifying their income streams and doing whatever it takes to preserve their connection to the river. I admire their toughness and will continue to fight for their industry. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 28 August I brought the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources to the Hawkesbury to meet local farmers so that he could understand what they're facing. The minister was keen to assist and I understand he has asked the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation to work with farmers to deliver disease-resistant Tasmanian oysters to the Hawkesbury. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank Rob Moxham for hosting us, as well as Bruce Alford, Les Wadham, Denis Christie, Adam Millward, Steve Jones and Dale Witchard, for taking the time to explain their situation to me and the minister.  I would also like to thank Debbie and Peter O'Sullivan for taking us out on the river to inspect their oyster farm and for allowing us to sample local oysters at the Hawkesbury River Oyster Shed. I can assure the House that Hawkesbury River oysters remain as sweet and delicious as always and I encourage all members to visit and try them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  This week we have learnt that more Centrelink jobs will be axed from regional Australia, with 30 jobs to be cut from the Illawarra. So much for this government's decentralisation plans! They held a decentralisation hearing in Burnie in my electorate last year, where the message given was clearly received: our community wants permanent, full-time, federal government public sector jobs and better services. Instead of listening to the people of the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania, this government has failed. Not one new federal government public sector job has been delivered. Is that because the former Treasurer—now Prime Minister—truly thinks that Tasmanians are a bunch of beggars? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has cut over 6,000 jobs from the Department of Human Services. In my electorate at Devonport and Burnie, there are 30 empty desks. This means decreased services to almost 30,000 Braddon people who interact with Centrelink. Today I am calling on the Prime Minister to rule out any further cuts to Centrelink in north-west Tasmania, and while he's at it, apologise to Tasmanians for referring to us as 'beggars'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows how important decent services and regional public sector jobs are. That is why we have announced a plan for an additional 1,200 Department of Human Services jobs. In my electorate, an extra 50 full-time equivalent positions will be allocated to Centrelink centres in Burnie and Devonport, delivering increased services, plus injecting $3.6 million into the local economy. Only Labor is committed to public sector jobs in regional Australia.</span>

It's really important for us. We have distributed energy systems that combine reliability, effectiveness in terms of cost and sustainability.

Fifty per cent of the Yackandandah population of 1,200 households is on solar power, and 170 of those households are using controlled devices to manage their voltage. We're setting up a community retailer with 650 people signed up. Today in parliament we've got one of the leaders of the community that's helping us do that: the CEO of AusNet Services.

In saying welcome to him, I'd also like to acknowledge and thank Ivor for his terrific work. My community is benefitting from an ARENA project and an AusNet project, Mondo, to build mini grids where we can share electricity between communities and between houses. We've got the technology that the Minister for Energy wants so much, so we can do all that. But I say to the government: we in north-east Victoria have demonstrated we can bring prices down, we can improve reliability and we can do something about emissions. We are doing it. Come and join us. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I must acknowledge Jason Clare MP and Warren Entsch MP, the co-chairs of Parliamentary Friends of Prostate Cancer Awareness. Tragically, each year 3,000 men die of prostate cancer. One in seven men develop prostate cancer before they turn the age of 75. You'd think, if you had those odds to win TattsLotto—a one in seven chance—you'd be right there buying a ticket every week. The tragedy is that so many men don't get a prostate cancer blood test each year. I say to the men over the age of 50 years, make sure you get a prostate cancer blood test, if not for you, for your wife and your children. My personal experience is that my father has had prostate cancer for many years. He's gone through hell with it. He's been an absolute fighter. I congratulate him for everything he's achieved in life—he recently received an Order of Australia.</span>

In closing, for every person who is listening who is a bloke over the age of 50, every year get a blood test, because it can save your life and it can make sure your family members don't live through hell.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  I was horrified to learn today that the Adani project has allegedly breached its approval conditions by drilling a series of groundwater bores without approval. They've drilled 60 groundwater bores, they've cleared vegetation and they've done roadworks. It is absolutely appropriate that the Queensland government is investigating the potential breach. When the former federal environment minister announced the approvals, he promised the rigorous conditions he imposed would protect threatened species and provide long-term benefits for the environment through the development of an offset package. He said that the measures must be approved by himself before mining could start. This parliament knows that environmental conditions are critical to the integrity of approvals and of a project.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Adani is commencing projects before approvals are given, it's a contradiction of condition 7 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act approvals. It is absolutely urgent that the new Minister for the Environment steps in and shows strong leadership on this allegation. She needs to launch an immediate investigation. There are hundreds of constituents in Macquarie sceptical of the ability of Adani to stick to the rules. They expect the strongest possible action from the minister. Based on the approvals that it's given, it is incumbent upon Australians that this project will not have negative impacts on our precious water supply, particularly when the eastern seaboard is in drought. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'm advised that around half of the required 10,000 cubic metres of sand has been removed from the channel. But I am raising this issue in the House today because, quite frankly, it's having a real impact on local businesses and residents, and their voices need to be heard. I've spoken directly with the New South Wales Minister for Lands and Forestry, Paul Toole. I've also been working with Taylor Martin MLC and Adam Crouch MP.</span>

Tracey Kirr from Kirby's Variety Store said, 'The shop has had to close on a Sunday because I can't afford to pay wages.' While Jenilla from TaylorMade Pet Supply and Grooming said, 'A lot of businesses are struggling to make ends meet.'</span>

I am calling on the New South Wales government and the council to be on the side of Ettalong businesses and local residents who are crying out. I am calling for additional funding and ongoing consultation with our local community until the dredging is done. Enough is enough. Let's get it done.</span>

I'm standing today because the merry-go-round of Prime Ministers lands us with a new Prime Minister. I would like to know what this new Prime Minister is going to do for schools and what he is going to do about funding. I've thought about this and I've decided that I think I'm wasting my time in even getting up today to ask these questions, because the member for Cook was in the cabinet when the member for Sturt was Minister for Education. He was in the cabinet when Senator Birmingham was Minister for Education. This week, he's appointed the member for Wannon the Minister for Education. So we have the merry-go-round of prime ministers: the member for Warringah; the member for Wentworth. Why would the member for Cook be any different to the member for Warringah, who said there'd be no cuts to schools and education, won government and immediately put in cuts?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are only two things people can rely on in this place. One is that you can rely on the Liberal merry-go-round of prime ministers to cut education to the tune of $17 billion. And you can rely on a Shorten-led Labor government, if elected, putting every cent of that $17 billion back into our schools in a needs based, sector-blind way. That means every child in every school will get the education that they deserve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I would like to draw the House's attention to the issue of local entrepreneurship and how we can best assist our small businesses. I recently met with Nutan Srivastava, a local businesswoman who started her own healthcare college in Macquarie Park and has achieved commendable success. Her business, TrEd College, offers training and assessment across a host of healthcare aspects including aged care, disability support and early childhood learning. Ms Srivastava has grown her business to over half-a-dozen full-time employees and has begun an international presence in Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. In this regard, her business is particularly commendable. She is seeking to export high-quality medical and healthcare education to countries which could greatly benefit from Australia's cutting-edge standards and practices. Unfortunately, Ms Srivastava has expressed to me that cracking into the foreign markets has been needlessly difficult because of Australian licensing and regulatory requirements. She has been waiting months to receive the Commonwealth's register of institutions and courses for overseas students' certification. And, once she receives that, she'll have to go through further hoops to be fully registered. It is disappointing to see our community's entrepreneurial talents bound up by bureaucracy and red tape. I hope we can continue reducing barriers to business development so that our communities may prosper and develop. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The people of Western Australia have been patiently waiting for this government to conduct some action on the GST. In the meantime the Leader of the Opposition has shown a real interest in WA, visiting several times—too many to count.

Last week the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, travelled to Cairns to announce $10 million in funding towards stage 2 of this project. This delivers on one of my 2016 election commitments. The Cairns Innovation Centre will be a game changer for our region. It will be a place where businesses, entrepreneurs, community organisations, researchers, educators and students can work to learn more from each other. The Cairns Innovation Centre will nurture a new generation of students and young graduates. My region has certainly become one of those leading regional centres for educational excellence, something the entire community should be proud of.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To build a new northern Australia, we need to generate new types of thinking and new skills. The Cairns Innovation Centre will certainly go a long way to ensuring that this happens. This will further diversify the Cairns economy, boost its exports and attract innovators from around the world to our city. Construction of stage 2 of the Cairns Innovation Centre is expected to begin at month's end and end in February 2020. It will create 100 construction jobs and 100 ongoing jobs, including seven Indigenous positions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I personally want to thank JCU's vice-chancellor, Professor Sandra Harding, and Advance Cairns for their tireless advocacy in ensuring that this dream becomes reality. It is the vision of people like Professor Harding that makes Far North Queensland a great place to live, work and play.</span>

It was only in July this year that the then Turnbull government realised that Western Australia even existed, announcing a similar plan—although the Liberals' plan detail remains to be seen. How can we be assured that the Liberals' plan isn't going to be robbing Peter to pay Paul? How can we be assured that the funds to lift GST distribution to the states won't be derived from other cuts to health, education or infrastructure? I'm sick of reading headlines and full-page newspaper ads saying that Labor won't agree to the now PM's plan—a plan that the now PM won't even back in writing to the WA Premier.</span>

The government's preferred method of negotiating on GST is instead expletive-laden tirades—not to mention that it seems that a majority of the WA Liberal members supported the member for Dickson becoming Prime Minister, who gave no support for a fair share of GST for WA at all.</span>

It's estimated that some 2½ million Australians have been diagnosed with asthma. That means that something like two in three Australians are impacted via family, friends or workmates. We know that asthma is not just a childhood disease; it can be contracted or developed at any age. Significantly, what is perhaps less known to most of us is that asthma is a life-threatening disease. Indeed, more than 400 of our fellow Australians die from asthma related disease each year, yet one in three people don't realise that this is a life-threatening condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many triggers for asthma, many of them known, such as pollen and smoke and viruses, but even physical activity can bring on asthma in certain circumstances. As we've learned recently from Victoria and elsewhere, thunderstorms can be a cause of asthma in certain people. Obviously, using an asthma preventer is the best way to reduce the asthma symptoms and flare-ups for people who have or are susceptible to this disease. It is, in many ways, a silent disease in terms of its incidence in the community, and it's worthwhile knowing that this can occur for many Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Let's see how that negotiation style's going to go when you try to get all the states and territories to agree to this empty GST plan. In WA yesterday, on radio, it has been reported that he apparently gave his word that the GST plan will be in place before the next election.</span>

It got him nowhere—just a luxury flat in New York. Congratulations! So he gave his word. I guess it's: job done, feet up—put your feet up, Prime Minister; go have a break! Why don't you just take off to New York with Malcolm? We've seen you do it before. This government refuses to give any detail to the Premier of Western Australia, who has requested detail for your GST plan. But you're not giving it, are you, member for Kooyong? Former Treasurer or Treasurer or whatever you are now—who knows? It's hard to keep up with you guys when you chop and change and move and so forth. We just don't know what's going on over there. What we do know is Western Australians on the other side didn't support a Western Australian to be Prime Minister of this country. We know that for certain.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The current franking credit rules make sure that taxpayers receiving company profits will be taxed at their marginal tax rate on this income. This company tax paid on their behalf is credited to taxpayers to reduce their tax bill by the amount of tax the company has already paid. Where the taxpayer has a low or zero tax rate, such as an SMSF, this results in the tax paid by the company being refunded to them. This ensures that they are taxed appropriately on the income they receive from investing in Australian companies. This is a fair result under our tax system and is not a "loophole" or a "rort".</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">For SMSFs that are in retirement phase and have a zero-tax rate, the Labor policy will effectively impose a 30 per cent tax on profits received from Australian company shares they own. This is an unfair outcome for people in retirement phase, and a targeted tax on a popular asset class which is not replicated anywhere else in the Australian financial system.</span>

Thank you to the 240,000 Australians working in residential care. Thank you to the 130,000 working in home and community care. Thank you for the dignity, the comfort and the reassurance you bring to the lives of the people whom we love. My colleagues and I appreciate that what you do is hard work. It's physically taxing—helping people in and out of bed and helping them shower and dress and eat—and then there's the emotional commitment too. You've got to be up and you've got to be on because the people that you care for are taking their cues from your demeanour every day.</span>

But it is more than that: Australians working in aged care do not get from the government the support that they deserve, the training that they need or the staff numbers they require. And, too often, Australians working in aged care do not get the pay that they deserve. Labor believes that every Australian has the right to dignity and security in retirement. To everyone living in aged care and to everyone working in aged care and to everyone waiting for aged care, Labor will do better for you.</span>

He stands in this place and he makes bold promises and claims and engages in a gush of empathy, but he has no practical ability to deliver one promise to one person in Australia, because he has no ability to manage a strong economy or manage a budget—neither he nor the shadow Treasurer, or any of those who were proven failures when they were last in government when it came to managing the nation's finances.</span>

Our plan for an even stronger Australia is about keeping our economy strong to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on, as we discussed in the House yesterday, to keep Australians safe—and the Liberal and National parties know all about that task and have demonstrated that in this government over the last five years and when we were last in government—and, importantly, to keep Australians together. Our plan to keep Australians together is about standing with Australians, their families and their communities—to have their back and to back those families and those Australians—and ensuring that we respect all of their beliefs, that we listen to all of their views, that we acknowledge all of their concerns, that we appreciate all of their contributions as Australians, and that we stand with them to protect the freedoms which they hold dear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are standing together with families and small businesses to lower their taxes to ensure they keep more of what they earn and to ensure they have cheaper electricity prices through the policies pursued by this government. We are standing with rural and regional Australians, particularly those affected by the drought, to ensure that their health and their education services continue to be delivered and can be paid for by our strong financial management. We stand with them to achieve the drought relief, the recovery and the hope that they seek and that they are after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are standing with young people and women, as we are seeing young people and women getting into jobs and participating in our economy in record numbers. The gender wage gap has come to the lowest level in many years. We're seeing that gap condensed. We're seeing female participation in the labour force rise, and we saw 95,500 young people get a job under the watch of this government—the best result in 30 years for a fiscal year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're standing with parents in Australia so the choices they make for how their children should be educated can be protected and preserved. No-one should get between a parent and their child when it comes to the choices those families make to ensure that the education those parents want for those children can be preserved in the way that they choose and so that they get the affordable child care that gives those families choices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're standing with migrant communities; we're recognising their continued success. We're the most successful immigration country in the world today, and we know that migrant communities come to make a contribution, not take one. We're standing for those people of faith and belief in this country, and only this government can be guaranteed, relied upon and trusted to protect— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Was the Prime Minister honestly saying that the reason women are paid less, have fewer leadership roles in business and are less represented in important national institutions is because they display less effort, less credibility and less merit than men?</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying, because Senator Singh wouldn't join up with one of the bother factions of the Labor Party, she was relegated, and I'll tell you why: it's because under the Labor Party show and tell on your vote isn't an exception; it's the rule. The Deputy Leader of the Labor Party admitted today that show and tell on votes is actually okay because they're a collective group. It's okay to do that if it's institutionalised. That's the way of the Labor Party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Labor Party says he wants to run the country like a union. He runs the Labor Party like a union, and we know how the unions intimidate on building sites. We know that the led, bred and fed approach of the union movement with this Leader of the Labor Party has infused their entire culture, and that's what he wants to bring to the leadership of this country. This is why the Leader of the Labor Party can't be trusted.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He likes to talk about these issues. Well, where was he when the member for Lindsay was subjected to the roughhouse tactics of her members out there in Western Sydney?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where was he when, apparently, there had been a formal investigation underway for about a year in the Labor Party and he knew nothing? He knew absolutely nothing when questioned on these issues. His attention to these sorts of matters in his own party was to stick his head under the table and pretend they weren't there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:12</span>):  I thank the member for Petrie for his question. He, like 25 million other Australians, knows that the government can be trusted to deliver good economic management and that the Labor Party can't be trusted to run the economy and can't be trusted with money. And, if they can't be trusted with money, they end up coming after yours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian economy is growing at 3.4 per cent. We've created more than one million new jobs and we're bringing the budget back to balance earlier than expected in 2019-20. Fundamental to our economic plan is providing tax relief to millions of Australian families and businesses. We have legislated tax relief to ensure that 10 million Australians are getting a benefit of up to $530 a year at first stage, that 94 per cent of taxpayers pay no more than 32.5c in the dollar, and that more than three million small- and medium-sized enterprises will benefit from our tax plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can confirm to the House that earlier in the Senate today our $20,000 instant asset write-off extension has gone through, and more than 300,000 businesses have benefited from our instant asset write-off. This stands in stark contrast to what those opposite are offering the Australian people—$200 billion in additional taxes. Under the Labor Party, you'll pay more on your income, you'll pay more on your business, you'll pay more on your property and you will, as a retiree, have your savings raided. That is what will happen under the Labor Party. If you're in Petrie and you're a forklift driver, you will pay up to $4½ thousand more in tax under the Labor Party's plan than ours. If you are a small local supermarket, you will pay up to $10,000 more in tax under Labor's plan if you were running that business in Petrie, employing young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Australians have a clear choice at the next election. They can have the tax-and-spend policies of those opposite or they can have the proven economic management of the coalition, which has created more than one million jobs and is leaving more money—the hard-earned money of Australians—in their pockets.</span>

It can help cut out that bottom 10 per cent that probably shouldn't be there anyway'. Neither the member for Warringah nor Malcolm Turnbull would ever have promoted a statement like that. Why is it that, at the same time Australians are making an extraordinary effort to help our farmers in drought, the Prime Minister is promoting material that dismisses those farmers hurting most?</span>

Prime Minister, my community of Indi wants action on climate change. They know that the future is with renewable energy and they want the government to lead the way. Prime Minister, you said the NEG is dead, but there's no legislation setting emission targets, and yet you remain committed—which we welcome—to the Paris agreement. Prime Minister, what's next? What is the future of the Renewable Energy Target? What action is government going to take on climate change? Can you please share what your plans are not only for my electorate of Indi but for all of us in regional Australia who rely so closely on the climate for our living?</span>

Australia has met our emissions targets that have fallen due to date. Australia will meet the emissions targets that we have set for the future in both 2020 and 2030. Australians are doers; they're not talkers about these things. We have a proud record of meeting the commitments that we agreed to and we set for ourselves in these international forums. That's why we remain committed to these agreements; because we would not want to cast any doubt on our commitment to other agreements. When we make a commitment and we set our minds to those targets in those international fora, we pursue them. Kyoto 1 we cleared by 128 million tonnes. With Kyoto 2 in 2020 we anticipate meeting that by in excess of 294 million tonnes. There was a billion-tonne turnaround from what was occurring under the Labor Party to what is now occurring under the policies of this government over the last five years. Emissions are at the lowest level per capita and as GDP in the last 28 years, and in electricity it's the lowest since September of 2000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will meet the 2030 Paris targets. Our suite of policies, which includes the Emissions Reductions Fund, the small-scale and the large-scale RET, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and, indeed, what will be the great legacy of Prime Minister Turnbull—Snowy 2.0, a significant investment in renewable and dispatchable power for Australia's future—will all assist us in meeting this target, and the energy efficiency measures and the demand management measures equally make up our policy to meet those targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're doing it also without sacrificing jobs. More than a million jobs have been created while we've been going about this billion-tonne turnaround that we inherited from the Labor Party. Our commitments are clear, our policies are clear and our intentions are clear.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure,Transport and Regional Development and Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:20</span>):  I thank the member for Murray for his question. He, like all of us on this side of the House, knows and understands that strong regions build a strong economy. Strong regions build a strong country and that's what we're committed to each and every day. Good economic management is good for regional Australia. When the regions are strong, so too is our nation. We've helped small businesses, particularly those in the member for Murray's electorate and elsewhere in regional Australia, create a million jobs in five years. We have given tax cuts to small businesses, particularly in regional Australia, that make such a difference—$1.4 billion in regional programs and billions more in regional infrastructure with more to come. This investment is about more doctors in the bush through the Murray-Darling Rural Medical Schools Network. That is going to be important infrastructure to help more doctors so that they can train from end to end. We know that when they train in the bush, chances are they'll stay in the bush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to compliment the Minister for Health, who has enabled, thanks to our strong economy, more drugs to go on the PBS such as ORKAMBI. When you talk about ORKAMBI, you talk about Jack and Annelise Golder from Temora shire. They go to school in Ariah Park in my electorate. They are just young kids. They want the best possible future and they are going to have that. They're cystic fibrosis sufferers but, thanks to having a strong economy, we can put more life-saving drugs on the PBS and it is kids like Jack and Annelise who are going to benefit from that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side are also fixing Labor's independent youth allowance mess so country kids don't have their potential limited by their postcode. We're lifting the parental income cut-off for the work force participation independence criteria for regional students from $150,000 to $160,000 and by a further $10,000 for each additional child in the family. We've appointed a National Rural Health Commissioner, Dr Paul Worley, and I pay tribute to the member for Lyne for his work in that regard and, as well, former Senator Fiona Nash when she was the rural health minister. I think she would make a very good member for Eden-Monaro. I do, absolutely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's job-creating productivity-enhancing infrastructure, of course, as well, such as upgrades to the north-east rail line that's going to benefit people in the Murray electorate, such as the Echuca-Moama bridge across the Murray River. In the $20 million regional jobs and investment package, there will be 21 projects in the member who asked the question's electorate, which will create more than 750 jobs in the region, and more than 440 of those will be ongoing. What do we see from those opposite? We see no money for mobile phone towers, no idea, no vision for regional Australia. That's what those opposite stand for and, rest assured, it will be an absolute mess if ever that man there becomes Prime Minister. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This is what the government I've been part of has done for Tasmania: the Cradle Mountain cable car, $30 million; Burnie soccer club, $500,000; the Latrobe club mitigation works, $3.4 million; $300,000 for the Devonport Gymnastics Club; $2.5 million for Ulverstone Cultural Precinct; $350,000 for the West Park upgrade; the Bass Highway upgrade of $60 million; the Murchison Highway upgrade of $10 million; the King Island Child Care and Early Learning Centre, $300,000; the Rotary Club of Ulverstone community facility, $55,000; the Devonport Living City waterfront project, $10 million; $70,000 for the Coastal Motocross Club; the Irishtown Community Centre, $25,000; Phoenix Community House men's shed, King Island, $125,000; the Ridgley Football Club and Ridgely Cricket Club, $35,000; the Ulverstone cricket club, $70,000; and the Wynyard BMX park at $200,000.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is total funding of some $3.8 billion in 2018-19, an increase of $28.5 million since the last budget in specific-purpose payments and other payments to the state of Tasmania. That's what I call recognising Tasmania—running a strong economy, working with Premier Will Hodgman and Treasurer Gutwein in Tasmania to ensure a strong economy that is delivering for Tasmanians. But there is a great risk to Tasmania, a terribly great risk to Tasmania. Thankfully, at the last state election they averted the election of a Labor government there, but there is still the great risk for Tasmania that, if those opposite, the Labor Party, get their hands on the Australian economy, Tasmania will suffer under their management.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to young people, we have seen 95,000 young Australians finding employment in 2017-18, which is the best result in a financial year for around 30 years. It's absolutely critical that young people are able to get in and get a job, because it delivers for them not only financial security but also the skills, knowledge and expertise they need. When those opposite left office, how many young people had lost jobs? Twenty thousand of them had lost jobs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Transition to Work program is also achieving real results for people aged between 15 and 21. We're making sure that they have proper pre-employment assistance so that they are not becoming long-term unemployed. We know that young people want more flexible and innovative ways to work and we have a self-start program for those young people. We've got facilitators making sure that those who want to be enterprising and start a business will be able to do just that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite need to appreciate that when people get a job they need to be paid well and, for women, it is important to close the gender pay gap. Under those opposite, when they were last in government, the gender pay gap stood at 17.2 per cent. Under our government, it has been narrowed to 14.5 per cent, a record low. We do know that there is still more work to be done, but things under our government are actually heading in the right direction. As Minister for Women, for the first time I will be delivering a women's economic security statement—for the first time ever—focused on these issues, because we stand with women and we stand with— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Yesterday the banking royal commission heard shocking evidence that Grant Stewart's son, who has Down syndrome, was bullied into signing up for insurance that he didn't want, need or even understand. At the time this occurred the Prime Minister had already voted against a royal commission and ridiculed people for calling for this royal commission. Will the Prime Minister at least now apologise to Mr Stewart and his son for voting against the royal commission 26 times and calling it a 'populist whinge'?</span>

It was despicable. I am pleased that, ultimately, the matter was rectified, but that doesn't condone it or forgive it in any way, shape or form. When I became Treasurer, my approach was, and has always been, to try and fix problems as I find them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the matters that were plaguing our banking and financial industry, we moved quickly. The Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations, who was then the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, took action to deal with the serious problems occurring in our banking and financial industry. We increased the resources for ASIC. We increased the penalties. We increased its powers. We introduced the toughest accountability regime legislated in this place for banking and financial institutions in the country. We didn't stop; we kept going and we've continued to add to all of those measures.</span>

I regret not having done that earlier for that reason. The reason I made the comments I did at the time is that I wasn't going to go around Australia and promise hurting people that they would get outcomes from a royal commission that would change their circumstances. I was never going to promise that. Those who did that, like those opposite, were giving people false hope and engaging in a form of cruelty that I would not engage in.</span>

So I regret that we did not do it earlier. I am pleased it is happening now. In addition to that, the commissioner will report in September, this month, and at the end of that review of their interim report we will make further decisions on how we progress from there.</span>

I know that he is passionate about ensuring choice when it comes to education for all parents in his electorate of Bowman. The coalition believes in a well funded and fairly funded public education system, in a well and fairly funded Catholic education system, and in a well and fairly funded independent schools sector. We all want the best for our children. As a coalition government we believe in the right of Australian parents to choose when it comes to education. Why? Because it is fundamental to allow them to provide the best outcome for their children.</span>

We're enthusiastic in our support for all school sectors. We believe that choice is important because it's a core value of coalition governments. It's why we are providing record funding to government schools, record funding to Catholic schools and record funding to independent schools.</span>

The Prime Minister delayed a royal commission into the banks for almost two years, calling it a 'populist whinge'. Is the Prime Minister aware that this week the royal commission heard that one insurance company broke the law over 300,000 times? Instead of making excuses, when will the Prime Minister apologise to Australians for running a protection racket for bad behaviour and voting against the royal commission 26 times?</span>

What I just made very, very clear was my deep regret, for the reasons that I outlined. I'm pleased that the royal commission is now proceeding. The matters that have been presented at the royal commission are deeply disturbing but, as the shadow Treasurer would know, the matters that the commission is investigating happened on so many occasions on the watch of those who sit opposite. They did not initiate a royal commission when they were in government. They did not even support a financial system inquiry when they were in government. This is an opposition that is a lion when in opposition but a mouse when in government. When they come in this place and they raise these issues, completely blind to their own failings, their own culpability and their own lack of empathy, they only expose to the Australian people the shallowness of their position. I'll invite the Treasurer to add to my answer.</span>

I might just briefly note on indulgence that it is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 7 December last year this parliament passed—after a national plebiscite process—the very historic bill to amend the Marriage Act. Strengthening the rights to equality before the law for same-sex couples in Australia is something of which this government and this parliament can be very proud. The process itself also demonstrated that unavoidable reality about how democratic systems define and protect rights—being the reality that liberties don't always neatly coexist and dovetail into some a perfect system where all rights simultaneously are achievable without some compromises. More often than not, rights collide and require consideration and compromises. So equality before the law is considered in the context of freedoms of association and religious expression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finding the best common compromise in modern Australia has not been a process that has always paid enough and due consideration to freedoms of association and freedoms of religion. That is why this government, on 22 November 2017, appointed Philip Ruddock to chair an expert panel to examine whether Australian law adequately protects these fundamental human rights. But this isn't a new issue. In 1998, the then Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission reported that many Australians suffered religious discrimination and just last year the UN expressed a concern about the lack of direct protection against discrimination on the basis of religion at the federal level in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In being asked about alternatives, it does strike the government that one of the problems about doing nothing in this area is demonstrated by a very recent matter that arose in Queensland where a Baptist Community Care organisation did something that many organisations did during the plebiscite, which was that they put a view about the plebiscite to their employees—in a very modest and respectful way, I might add. They faced a full discrimination and vilification action in Queensland and, having been successfully cleared of that action, now face a Queensland Industrial Relations Commission action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of this issue to Australians is evidenced by the fact that the panel received over 15,000 submissions and had 90 consultation meetings. As our government finalises its response to the report, I would like to thank the members of that committee for their diligence. I might note that the process that we will all need to embark on is going to require some common ground and some care and consultation. But the alternative to doing nothing in this space is to consider religious freedom as somehow a second-order right that deserves less protection than discrimination based on sex, race or age. This government does not consider religious freedom a second-order right.</span>

Certainly the Ruddock report was referred to. At no point did I hear the Attorney say he was quoting from it. He referred to the number of submissions and all the rest. The rules are clear around requesting documents to be tabled in question time, and they relate to documents that the minister has been quoting from. He's made it clear that that doesn't fall into that category. I didn't hear anything that made it the case, and I don't want to see question time move to an area where we're just asking each other to table documents from all over the place. So that matter is settled for the time being.</span>

Clause 2.11 of the Statement of Ministerial Standards requires the minister to avoid conflicts between his private interests and his official duties. But, according to media reports, the minister chose to participate in government discussions on the childcare industry to offer what he said was the 'point of view of operators'. Does the minister consider he has complied with clause 2.11 of the ministerial standards, when his childcare businesses have reportedly received in excess of $5 million in taxpayers' money and he chose to participate in those discussions about child care?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:46</span>):  I thank the honourable member for his question. He has an acute understanding of this drought, particularly in his electorate of Calare in New South Wales. He is proud that this government has invested over $1.9 billion into farming communities and farms themselves throughout this drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we understand that it's the state governments' responsibility to look after animal welfare, freight and fodder throughout a drought. It's the federal government's responsibility to look after farmers' welfare. Proudly, our government lifted the Farm Household Allowance assistance to $37,626 a year to give farmers the dignity and respect they need, to allow them to be able to pay for household expenses and to give them the time to make tough decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've complemented that with a further $8½ million for rural financial counsellors. These are the angels of the drought. These are the people who go out and sit around the kitchen tables of farmers and give them the strategic advice they need. I'm proud to advise the House today that I've given approval for a further 39 Rural Financial Counselling Service staff to complement the already existing 116 staff. They will go into electorates like Calare as soon as possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not just thinking about the here and now; we're also thinking about the future. We're making sure that we have preparedness and resilience in place in our measures and our policies for drought. I'm also proud to announce today to the House that our government will invest a further $15 million into pest and weed control for drought affected communities. This takes our investment up to $40 million for pest and weed control in drought affected communities. This is allowing farmers to attack weeds of national significance, weeds that cost our agricultural sector around $4 billion a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, it's about building the thousands of kilometres of dog-exclusion fencing; it is about bringing sheep back into our country and bringing shearers back into our towns. This is a strategic investment not only in the profitability of agriculture but also in environmental outcomes. Because of this investment we're seeing brolgas and koalas and small marsupials coming back into western Queensland and New South Wales for the first time. It's a strategic investment in the profitability of agriculture. We're seeing, for the first time, an increase in lambing rates, from seven to 85 per cent. That's putting real money in people's pockets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important investment, but we want to be bolder than that. We're making a big investment in water infrastructure. We're making a bold invest of nearly $500 million in trying to droughtproof this nation. We've got eight projects already underway, and three more planned to start in the near future. This is making sure that we are having a strategic impact on the future of agriculture's productivity and profitability, but it's the states' responsibility to build dams. We are doing our bit. I put my hand out to them today to come on that journey and droughtproof this nation with us, believing in agriculture, believing in water and believing in regional and rural Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He's been a strong advocate for this program designed to reduce social harm caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol and drug abuse and gambling in areas with high levels of welfare dependency. He's been a particularly strong advocate for extending the cashless debit card to Bundaberg and Hervey Bay—this, I might say, in the face of trenchant opposition from Labor and the Greens. But, despite that trenchant opposition, the Morrison government has now delivered, has now secured legislative approval to extend the cashless debit card to Bundaberg and Hervey Bay with the legislation passing the Senate yesterday.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this builds on three existing trials in Ceduna, the Goldfields and East Kimberly. Significantly, the composition of people in the trial in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay will be 14 per cent Indigenous and the rest non-Indigenous. A very significant question indeed was asked by an ABC journalist yesterday speaking to the shadow minister. He said, 'So why would you'—meaning Labor—'support the trial in majority-Indigenous communities being extended but not support it being expanded to areas that are not majority Indigenous?' It's a very good question. What the shadow minister had to say in response to that was to assert that it had nothing to do with the demographics of the community. She said, 'There's not been a proper community consultation, which is patently clear.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the facts. Let's look at the facts in relation to consultation. Between May 2017 and December 2017, the Department of Social Services conducted over 188 meetings in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area. This included five meetings with Commonwealth government agencies, 19 meetings with community members, three meetings with the community reference group, two large community meetings with the public, 25 meetings with local government representatives, four meetings with peak bodies and 55 meetings with service providers, and yet the shadow minister says that there was not adequate consultation. There was extremely strong and extensive consultation because the principle is very clear: the cashless debit card is an initiative designed to reduce the negative impact of welfare-fuelled alcohol and drug abuse and gambling in areas with high levels of welfare dependency, which certainly includes Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. Where there is strong community support for it, we will introduce it, and that is what we are doing in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. We're determined to make our welfare system work better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He knows about all the problems that regional Western Australia and regional Australia face—issues that we on this side know a lot about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As colleagues in this House well know, our regional communities are working hard every day to ensure that their local community and environment remain healthy and productive. Our farming communities, from Bencubbin in the west, which is in my electorate, out to Bundaberg in the electorate of the member for Hinkler, have a long history of sustainably managing our land for the production of world-class food and fibre while maintaining a healthy environment. We on this side know that farmers are the backbone of our country and that many people are currently suffering from the drought, but this coalition is backing those communities. Since 2013 this government has invested more than a billion dollars through our National Landcare Program. This is a program that delivers real outcomes for the environment and for landholders. Under this program we are treating more than 1.9 million hectares for weeds, including targeting the prickly pear in western Queensland. Eliminating weeds has a huge impact on properties, helping to get those productive paddocks back into action as well as providing a chance for native species to regenerate. We are culling damaging invasive animals across 2.2 million hectares. Eliminating those feral animals is positive news for regional communities. It keeps the land healthy for both agriculture and the environment. It's a true win-win.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Regional Land Partnerships is the flagship for the second phase of the National Landcare Program—$450 million over five years to ensure that local problems are solved by local solutions. This investment will help farmers to improve the productivity of their land. The Regional Land Partnerships will fund projects that protect our threatened ecological communities and support our most vulnerable native species.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all: the Emissions Reduction Fund is delivering real environmental benefits in a practical way that include providing an alternative income stream from the land for our farmers. These projects in the ERF make up $1.8 billion out of the $2.55 billion fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that we can have policies that support agriculture and the environment at the same time. Unlike Labor, the coalition government understand regional communities, and they can trust us. They cannot trust those opposite.</span>

In relation to these matters, I have taken the opportunity to consult with the Chief Government Whip, as well as the whips in the Senate, and I have had the opportunity to engage directly with members in relation to the events of several weeks ago. We will continue to deal with any issues that arise from that within the normal process that we have followed as a party. I note that this morning the deputy leader of the Labor Party indicated that the Labor Party has exactly the same process: where issues are raised they are raised with the party whips and there is a process of members supporting each other through what can be—as the Labor Party would know, because they went through this on plenty of occasions—during those periods moments of intense lobbying and moments of a lot of pressure on all members. I'm absolutely satisfied that there was no gender-specific lobbying or pressure placed on members. I can also tell you one thing: it is not an institutionalised policy of the Liberal Party that you show and tell on your ballot, which is what is always done in the Labor Party.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:59</span>):  I thank the member for his question. We are a much stronger and more prosperous nation because of our proud heritage of immigration and multiculturalism. No matter where you go in Australia, you will find immigration success stories. In every town, every suburb, every football club and every church you will find immigration success stories. As we look around the country, we see small-business owners investing in Australia and creating jobs. We see people working hard, playing by the rules and raising their kids in search of a better life. We see professionals, community volunteers, the people who help build the backbone of our nation. What matters in Australia is what you contribute to our nation, not where you come from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 19th century, of course, immigrants came overwhelmingly from the United Kingdom and from Ireland, but in more recent years we've welcomed people from around the globe—from Italy, from Greece, from China, from India, from Vietnam and so many other places. Being a citizen in our country is about committing to Australia and our values, like democracy and the rule of law, like so many millions of immigrants have done throughout our history. It doesn't matter whether you were born in Athens, in Armidale or in Apia; what matters is the commitment you make to the nation. As the Prime Minister says, being an Australian is about making a contribution, not taking a contribution. We have millions of immigration success stories in our nation that are a testament to just that principle. Nearly 70 per cent of our immigrants in the most recent year were skilled migrants, bringing important skills and economic activity to our nation. Businesses of immigrants employ some 1.4 million people, making a massive economic contribution to our nation, and the government will continue to back those people through tax support for small business and in so many other areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're a nation of immigrants and a nation of immigrant success stories. Importantly, we have an immigration system, under this government, with integrity. It was this Prime Minister who gave us back our border security and gave us back our immigration system with integrity. And it is this Minister for Home Affairs who has continued with that border security and that integrity of our immigration program, because we can never go back to the appalling legacy of Labor, of 50,000 unlawful arrivals, of 8,000 children in detention, of 1,200 deaths at sea. We will manage an immigration program with integrity. We'll manage an immigration program in support of our proud multicultural traditions.</span>

I notice that those opposite got quite excited about this issue today, but, as usual, they come into this place and misrepresent facts, they misrepresent the position. We're used to it on this side of the House, that they can't be trusted, but those outside this place have also been learning for a long period of time that they cannot trust the leader of the Labor Party. They know that the leader of the Labor Party is not fair dinkum when it comes to the truth, he's not fair dinkum when it comes to what he believes in and he's not fair dinkum in his interactions with the Australian people, because he's been putting on a show. He's been putting on a show the entire time, and the Australian people are seeing through it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I can confirm is that this government does have a $75 billion rolling infrastructure program that is connecting our regions with ports and markets. I can confirm that we have a $1 billion congestion-busting fund which is dealing with the challenges of population growth in our suburbs. I can confirm that we have a tax policy which we were able to implement and legislate which is reducing the tax burden on small and medium sized businesses of less than $50 million. And I can confirm that the Labor Party, if they are elected, will increase the tax on every single one of those businesses, from the smallest business through to businesses up to $50 million. They will increase their legislated tax position of 25 per cent up to 27½ per cent. I also know that they will roll back the legislated tax cuts for households, for families, that give them relief—a tax burden that we are taking off by legislating the abolition of a complete tax schedule, a complete threshold, which will mean that there will be no-one paying more than 32½c in the dollar in 94 per cent of cases. We are delivering lower taxes. We are delivering cheaper electricity prices. We are ensuring that we are rolling out the infrastructure that Australians need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member made reference to the conversation I had about GST. When will the leader of the Labor Party come clean on their position on the GST for Western Australia? Every time he goes to Western Australia he has a different position to his shadow Treasurer. They're for changing the formula; they're not for changing the formula. They're for 70 per cent; they're not for 70 per cent. They're for legislating; they're not for legislating. The people of Western Australia know that, when it comes to the leader of the Labor Party, he is a big phoney.</span>

It was a pleasure to visit his electorate just last week with the Prime Minister, in Berwick and in Pakenham—two of the fastest-growing areas in Melbourne and indeed in the country—to see some of those local hotspots. We saw them on McGregor Road. We saw them on Clyde Road, in Berwick. The member for La Trobe is fighting very hard to get those hotspots finished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with addressing local hotspots, this government is also investing in major congestion-busting infrastructure right across the country. In the budget this year, one of those projects that we announced was a $475 million commitment to finally build the Monash Rail. This would go from the Dandenong line at Huntingdale, connect up Monash University and eventually go all the way out to Rowville. In doing so, it would finally connect up Australia's largest university campus to the Metro rail. There are 55,000 students who use that university campus. They will finally be connected to the Metro rail. It will also connect up the second-biggest employment cluster in Melbourne, being in the Clayton area, to the Metro rail. It will take traffic off the street. Believe it or not, the bus link from Monash through to Huntingdale at present is the single busiest bus route in the country. We'll be taking those buses off the busy roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier studies also suggest—and I know the member for La Trobe is particularly interested in this—that, if we build this rail link, it will take the equivalent of a lane of traffic off the Monash Freeway. The member for La Trobe knows how congested that freeway is, despite the fact we're investing an extra billion dollars to widen that freeway to support those members out there. This is just one element out of a $75 billion package that the government is putting towards congestion-busting infrastructure across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked about alternatives by the member for La Trobe. This project, the Rowville-Monash rail, has been on the books since 1959. Believe it or not, we are the first government to put serious dollars into that project. And I ask: what is the opposition doing in relation to this project, in relation to the 55,000 students and in relation to those people stuck on the Monash Freeway? There's stony silence from the other side. The question is: how many more decades will they have to wait for the Labor Party to finally commit to this congestion-busting infrastructure to build the Monash-Rowville rail?</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I'll continue. What the post refers to is comments from feedlot operators from the north-west of New South Wales, Michael in Bellata and Sandy from near Moree, who are explaining what the drought means for them. It goes through a range of comments. There's another one from Mr Munroe that says: 'We know it will rain again. It always has. We've had droughts before, and we'll have them again. We'll get through this one. And most farmers—they're good operators—will survive because, to some extent, they have prepared in what way they can for this current event.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way our government is responding to the drought is to go out there and listen to what people in rural and regional communities are saying to us. I'm not going to censor their views; I'm going to listen to their views. That's what the member for New England is doing as the special envoy on drought. He's out there listening to, talking to and getting the feedback off farming communities in drought-affected areas. The Labor Party might want to close their ears to the voices of the bush, but the Liberal-National government never will. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>

                  <a href="C2T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I start by pointing out that since 2012 Australia has fallen six places on the international corruption perception index. I also refer to some excellent research by the Australia Institute, which indicates that 85 per cent of Australians think there is corruption in federal politics. Indeed, the perception of corruption impacts business investment and the efficient allocation of resources, thereby reducing our GDP by about four per cent or a thumping $72.3 billion a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a dreadful situation, but it's completely understandable, because when you look around us and look at our recent history, scandal after scandal and question after question raised about conduct, at the federal level in particular, you can understand why 85 per cent of Australians think there is indeed corruption in federal politics. I have a few examples. Who can forget the Australian Wheat Board being caught up in the bribery scandal with Saddam Hussein when selling wheat into Iraq? Who could forget how the Reserve Bank was caught up in the bribery scandal related to winning note-printing contracts abroad? What about, just very recently, a former member of this House, Mr Bruce Billson? He was the executive chair of the Franchise Council of Australia while he was the Minister for Small Business. That's right. Bruce Billson sat in this place as a minister of the Crown, the Minister for Small Business, when he was at the same time the executive chair of the Franchise Council of Australia. What about former minister Andrew Robb? He was the trade minister when the Chinese company Landbridge secured the 99-year lease for the Port of Darwin. It was a company that Mr Robb then went and worked part-time on an income of almost $1 million a year. No wonder 85 per cent of Australians think there is corruption in federal politics. Who could forget the secrecy over the mysterious federal government grant of $30 million to Foxtel? What about more recently? There was an even more mysterious grant, seemingly on a whim, of $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. I'm going to labour this point to death: no wonder 85 per cent of Australians think there is corruption in federal politics. No wonder the overwhelming majority of Australians are strongly of the view that there is a need for some sort of federal integrity commission, perhaps modelled along the lines of the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the New South Wales ICAC has been wonderfully successful since it was established. A number of people have found themselves in prison, and many parliamentarians have been forced to resign from the New South Wales parliament. What a wonderful example of the effectiveness of having some sort of corruption body at an appropriate level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stood with my colleague the member for Mayo and Senator McKim from the Greens outside the Magistrates Court here in the ACT just today because today is the day that the directions hearing will be conducted into the Witness K and Bernard Collaery matter. What better example is there? In fact, if I only had time for one example of why we need a federal integrity commission, I would refer to the Witness K and Bernard Collaery matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2004, the Australian government, the then Howard government, had the Australian Secret Intelligence Service plant bugs in the East Timor parliamentary building in order to eavesdrop on the confidential and highly sensitive joint venture partner negotiations over the sharing of the oil and gas revenue from the Timor Gap. It was something that was and remains clearly illegal under Australian law. It is clearly illegal under Australian law to use one of our foreign intelligence agencies to eavesdrop or spy on confidential joint venture partner commercial negotiations. What is the federal government doing about it? It's charged the whistleblower, Witness K, who's trying to shine a light on government misconduct and charged his lawyer, who is doing nothing more than representing his client and who felt compelled to speak to some journalists to shine a light on this most serious federal government misconduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is self-evident that Australia needs a federal integrity commission. It is remarkable that every state and territory now has or is putting in place an integrity watchdog. In my home state of Tasmania, we have the Integrity Commission. Yes, in Tasmania we might criticise the Integrity Commission and say it's not effective enough and we want it enhanced, but at least we have something. It beggars belief that, here in Canberra, we don't have any sort of watchdog to keep an eye on allegations of official misconduct—an organisation that we could have mobilised to look at the $444 million grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, that we could have mobilised to look into that mysterious $30 million grant to Foxtel or that could have looked into whether or not Andrew Robb got up to no good. He was the trade minister when Landbridge secured the 99-year lease for Darwin and then he went on to work for that company to the tune of almost $1 million a year for part-time work. I'm not alleging Mr Robb did anything wrong in that case, but, I'll tell you what, a reasonable person would look at that and say: 'It doesn't look or smell right. Someone should run a fine-tooth comb over that and make sure that Mr Robb acted properly.' It is the same with Bruce Billson. He sat in here as a minister of the Crown, the Minister for Small Business, while on the payroll of the Franchise Council of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the characteristics of a healthy democracy is that we can have confidence in it. You can only have confidence in your democracy, in your system of government, if you know you have effective processes in place, and that includes an effective integrity watchdog. It beggars belief that we don't have that just yet. I am very heartened and delighted, though, to see that the opposition, the Labor Party, which I understand has previously not been supportive of a federal ICAC-type body, has now adopted a policy. I say to the shadow Attorney-General: I hope that remains your policy and, when you speak, it'd be great to hear a commitment to that so that we can have confidence that, should the opposition become the government at the next election, you will move smartly to put in place some sort of federal integrity commission.</span>

I'm hoping that the Attorney-General will offer some explanation for the continuing reluctance of the government, of the coalition, to accept some sort of integrity commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It affect us in all sorts of ways. If you don't have an integrity commission of some kind, not only does it allow people to get up to no good; it also diminishes the community's confidence in our system of government, it diminishes confidence in this country from other countries, and it diminishes investor confidence. That's why the Australia Institute has calculated that our GDP is, in fact, diminished by about four per cent a year, over $70 billion a year, because people and, in particular, international investors would be less keen to invest in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every way you cut it, there are reasons to establish such a body. It beggars belief that in 2018 we don't have such a body. I'm in no doubt that as time goes on and the Witness K and Bernard Collaery matter unfolds, the community will more and more understand that that is probably the very best exemplar we could have of the need to have some body to look into allegations of serious misconduct. There could be no more serious misconduct than the use of one of our foreign intelligence agencies. So good on the ALP for having this. I hope to hear some sort of commitment from the Attorney-General in the next few minutes.</span>

I have listened carefully, and it is an issue I've thought about for a long time. Having practised in some of these jurisdictions, at least for a period of time, I'm not unfamiliar with them. I might commence by saying I think you may have been a little bit inaccurate—we'll need to check the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>—in your characterisation of Mr Billson's circumstances. I think you may have said he was a minister whilst also being on the Franchise Council. I do not believe that that is actually correct. I think Mr Billson ended his ministerial position in September 2015 and went on to the Franchise Council in March 2016. So we will need to check my recollection and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes to this very interesting and, I think, central point: individual human beings, men or women, parliamentarians, public servants and hardworking servants of the Australian Commonwealth can find that they are in a difficult set of environments and circumstances where their reputations can be utterly destroyed by looseness of consideration, by looseness of language and by poor process. The member for Denison asks for an explanation as to why any side of this parliament might exact some level of caution with respect to the adoption of a proposal—which at the moment from Labor is, if I may say, in very vague terms—for an overarching federal integrity commission based on the New South Wales ICAC model. I'll give you a starting reason for some caution in adopting that approach, and that is the member's statement that the New South Wales ICAC has been wonderfully effective. It cannot possibly be the case that anybody who has followed the jurisdiction and the outcomes from the New South Wales ICAC could possibly put forward a conclusion that somehow or other the experience of the New South Wales ICAC has at least not been mixed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some absolutely outrageous outcomes and processes through the New South Wales ICAC. I'll raise one here today with respect to Margaret Cunneen, the very respected prosecutor and senior counsel. The High Court found that the New South Wales ICAC had exceeded its authority based on its misinterpretation of 'corrupt conduct', a term inside the ICAC Act in New South Wales. That is to say, the High Court of this country found that the New South Wales ICAC, which you say has been wonderfully effective, didn't even understand the scope of its own mandate. That ICAC was required to pay costs for both sides in what was a farcical exercise, adding a further waste of taxpayer funds to what had been a spurious exercise in the first place. The High Court held that the alleged conduct with respect to the very well respected Margaret Cunneen could not have amounted to corruption even if it had occurred, and it was never proved. It was an outrageous exercise. So to come here and offer an observation that the reason that we should breathlessly adopt a very, very vague suggestion from Labor is that comparative bodies have been wonderfully effective, I think, demonstrates the looseness of thinking and language which causes enormous problems in this area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had some experience with the Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission. You may not know, but you may be interested to know, that recently the parliamentary inspector, Michael Murray QC, described a CCC investigator's actions as inexcusable and grossly negligent. He was making warrant applications based on false information, which Michael Murray found to be ineffective and inappropriate. Michael Murray found, with respect to the Western Australian CCC, 'systemic cultural, behavioural and managerial failures within the covert operation unit'. I've watched that jurisdiction. I take your point seriously: that this notion that these bodies are without fault is so horrendously wrong as to be a terrible basis for adopting that model in this jurisdiction without enormous caution and forethought.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just raise two other matters that have always concerned me with respect to activities in the Western Australian jurisdiction. One is with respect to a very well-respected public servant, Mr Michael Allen. This dates back to the Corruption and Crime Commission in Western Australia in or about 2007. They had a finding of misconduct against Mr Allen. He was a very well-respected senior civil servant who had served the state of Western Australia very well for many years. His reputation—and, I would suggest, his life—was utterly ruined by the report of the CCC in WA. He was a decent, hardworking man, and the finding of the parliamentary inspector into that report said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The CCC should publicly acknowledge that it was in error in finding that Mr Allen was guilty of misconduct, and withdraw not only the "opinion" of misconduct by Mr Allen as expressed in its Report of 5 October 2007 … but also its "substituted" opinion of 13 February 2008, as neither opinion is supported by evidence, and both are inconsistent with evidence which the CCC had, but did not refer to in its Report …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CCC destroyed a man's career by the single finding of a word in a report and it didn't include information that it had. You might find that that's perhaps not the sort of model that we want to breathlessly and thoughtlessly adopt here without some very, very serious structural understanding of what was going on. The parliamentary inspector found, with respect to the Allen matter:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another famous matter in Western Australia of the Labor politician—a great bloke—John D'Orazio. He was found guilty in a CCC report of 'inappropriate conduct'. It destroyed his career and destroyed his reputation. What did the parliamentary inspector find with respect to that finding? That the problem was that 'inappropriate conduct' was not actually a term used in the CCC's act and that they shouldn't have made the finding because there was no such thing at law under the CCC's own act. The parliamentary inspector said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment Australia has a multiagency approach. That ranking that you referred to has consistently had Australia in the top 20 countries as a low corruption jurisdiction. There has been movement, but we are consistently in the top 20 countries on Earth for low corruption. The Labor Party media release which gives their suggestion for this type of body—the findings of which I've just outlined—says that there is not, in effect, a corruption problem in Australia. To quote the Labor Party: 'Corruption has not become a major problem in Australian political life.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're consistently in the top 20 jurisdictions with the lowest levels of corruption on earth. Only two of those top 20 jurisdictions have the types of bodies that you're referring to. One of them is Hong Kong. I think the other one is Singapore. Most countries that have the low levels of corruption that we experience, irrespective of people's perceptions—and I acknowledge that is a problem and something that we can all work hard on to repair—have the type of specialised multiagency approach where a variety of very hardworking agencies specialise in looking at corruption of particular types at particular points. In our jurisdiction, those agencies are the AFP, ACLEI, the Australian Public Service Commission, ASIC, ANO, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority, which I'm sure you're aware we created; the Australian Electoral Commission, and the inspectors-general of intelligence, security and taxation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not utterly closed-minded to this suggestion, but in the Labor Party press release the detail is that it should have sufficient funding and sufficient jurisdiction, and one commissioner and two deputy commissioners—and that's about as far as the detail goes. That is hopelessly inadequate to try and draw a red line through what has been a perfectly well-operating system. That is not to say the system could not do with some form of reform, that some of the overlaps and inconsistencies can be clearly identified and repaired, but the idea that you put a line through that system and replace it with something that is not wonderfully effective is wrong-headed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  This is a classic reason as to why you need third voices in parliament. To hear the Liberal Attorney-General get up and effectively say there never should have been a body to investigate Labor's Eddie Obeid is truly reprehensible. The only reason that the government can give for not having a federal anticorruption watchdog is that sometimes it acts in ways that they don't like. What they fail to mention is that, of course, in many of those instances the anticorruption watchdog is subject to oversight by the courts, who can determine whether it is acting within its power. But, when a Liberal Attorney-General says there never should have been a body that could investigate people like Labor's Eddie Obeid, it tells you everything you need to know about this place. It's not good enough to resist an anticorruption watchdog on the basis that sometimes they do things that you don't like, because what the New South Wales experience has shown us is that an anticorruption watchdog picks up things that existing law enforcement agencies don't. Eddie Obeid was uncovered for his wrongdoing not because of the activities of a police force, not because of the activities of other investigatory bodies but because of the activities of an ICAC. If you ask anyone in this country, 'Do you think it's right that Labor's Eddie Obeid got sentenced?' they would say yes. There should be a body that is able to look at everyone without fear or favour, no matter what political party they come from—a body that can look under every conceivable rock and have the power to do it. You've just heard probably the best reason that we should have one. When one side of politics gets up to defend the other and says, 'There's nothing to see here; let's move on,' that is exactly why we need it. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you think that corruption stops at state borders, you've got rocks in your head. If it is happening at the New South Wales state level and if it's happening at other state levels, there's every reason to suspect it may have happened here over time as well. The idea that we don't need one because so far we haven't uncovered any evidence of it is the wrong way around. If there were an investigatory body, we might uncover some evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that the Greens have been pursuing for a very, very long time. Bob Brown introduced the first bill to give effect to a federal ICAC back in 2010. We repeated our claims for it in 2010; we pushed for it again in parliament in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and last year. Each step of the way, we have been opposed by the old parties. I am very pleased to see that we now might be seeing a repeat of the Greens' position on marriage equality, where we got opposed by all of the others until they agreed with us, and on the royal commission on the banks, where we got opposed by everyone else until they agreed with us. Now I am very pleased that the Labor Party has indicated that it is changing its position. That shows the value of having Greens and third voices in this parliament. We have been raising this since day one. We have been giving voice to what people in Australia want. Many other members of the crossbench have been part of that push as well. Now it seems to be bearing fruit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about how this government asks other people to behave. If you're on welfare, you are automatically suspected of being a criminal and you are subject to random drug testing. If you happen to have the misfortune of not having a job and are in one of their trial sites, you can be forced to come in and have a drug test because apparently you may have broken the law and we want to know about it. When you ask for a modicum of that to be flicked back on politicians and for politicians to be treated in some ways with the same kind of oversight so that there's a hand on someone's shoulder, 'No, we couldn't possibly do that,' squeal the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government doesn't want people looking into its activities, it probably tells you exactly why we need this body. One thing it will do is change the way ministers make decisions. We see day after day ministers with enormous power making decisions very often behind closed doors. They do it because they think they can get away with it and without scrutiny. If ministers know that they could be hauled before a corruption watchdog, it will change the way they act every time they make a decision, accept some money or do something that has a financial implication. There has been too much evidence of corruption in this country. There has been too much evidence to suggest that somehow it does exist at the federal level as well. A federal anticorruption watchdog, as championed by the Greens, would go a long way to restoring trust in politics.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the government. The Attorney-General is quite correct that by the time Mr Billson became Executive Chairman of the Franchise Council he had ceased being the Minister for Small Business. I thank the Attorney-General for correcting me, and I apologise to Mr Billson. I want to put that on the record. I still make the point that it was completely improper for Mr Billson to be in that position while he was a member of parliament. It is something that Mr Billson recognised afterwards was entirely improper and he apologised—I think on the <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>program—to that effect.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0H" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAMING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  I want to pick up the member for Denison's important point there, which is that today as we consider an additional layer of investigatory power we have to ask what additional elements that are potentially corrupt would be picked up by this new body that are not picked up already in the ruthlessly rigorous media, the incredible access to data through freedom of information and the multifaceted approach the Attorney-General has already outlined. The two questions we should all be asking, as anyone listening to this debate would be, are: first of all, how many times has potentially corrupt activity either fallen through the cracks or been improperly litigated because of our current structures; secondly, just how much corruption is there out there that we're missing completely and we need a new body to deal with? I think the point made by the Attorney-General is that we're both in the handful of top nations in the world and frankly going nowhere as one of the truly gold-standard economies for identifying corruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have three levels of government, and two of them do have ICAC-like structures. We can look at how they operate, but let's remember that the federal government and the areas in which we dwell are fundamentally different and we don't necessarily deal, like the tiny councils, in massive value-change propositions through development that require scrutiny. That isn't easily monitored because, by definition, they are small councils scattered all over the country, often with great variations in capacity within their staff. The federal area is predominantly immigration, defence and foreign affairs and then basically it's contract management through Defence and grants run by other federal departments. These are far less challenging areas to monitor than those at the state and local levels. This is one of the reasons why this multifaceted system has worked so well up to now. I think the Attorney-General expressed a willingness to look at strengthening our current multifaceted approach, and that's entirely reasonable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the debate really comes down to whether small changes are required or whether we need to look at that Griffith University and Transparency International report, which gave three very valuable alternatives, one of which was an ICAC, an independent body with jurisdiction over the entire public sector. That was their model and it comes with a price tag of just under $50 million a year. So it is reasonable to ask whether that $50 million a year is going to result in anything fundamentally different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's fair to look at that significant list provided by the member for Denison. The Wheat Board was quite easily exposed in the public domain and was subject to litigation. He gave us the Billson example, which simply identified a federal MP with another activity outside of parliament—a pecuniary interest or otherwise, gaining or profiting from it. That was quite easily examined and litigated without the need for an overarching body. The very fact that we can list out what has been potentially corrupt before just shows that the multifaceted system is working okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politically you can go to the Australian people and say, 'Do you reckon politicians are corrupt?' and 80 per cent say yes. But that is a fundamentally different question. I heard Labor members of parliament, as they were walking away from the MPI, saying, 'Just remember, vote for the ALP and you will get a federal ICAC.' It's politically convenient to argue for one, but in reality they have had four months since the budget reply speech and they have had, I think, a government that is quite willing to engage in the detail on this. Instead we just have one commissioner, two assistant commissioners and basically a roving job to move between existing public agencies. That's not really an ICAC at all.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to go back to Griffith University and Transparency International. They gave two other options. They gave the fully fledged Commonwealth integrity commission, which gave new standards on not just the Public Service but the individual parts of it, and to work directly with IPEA. Instead of just fitting in and around existing groups, it would have more direct involvement in their work. But you are moving into over $100 million a year. It's a fair question to ask what the additional gains are at the margins in having these bodies over and above what we already have. We have the public sector at the moment complaining about multiple codes of conduct they have to adhere to. Many of them would say the problem is not a lack of investigative powers; it is actually too many layers of investigative powers and not being aware of which one the Public Service has to respond to. That too is a fair question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For thinking contributors of this—and I regard the member for Denison as one and the member for Melbourne Ports probably not so much; he is probably a bit more party political about this—we need to ask whether we take a small step. And that was the third option provided by Griffith University: an integrity and anticorruption council, which simply coordinates through a statutory referral pathway all of these potentially concerning, albeit potentially corrupt, activities. These are many of the minor ones that have been mentioned already by the member for Denison— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This is because in the last week, if we ever needed it, the evidence supporting a federal anticorruption body has grown stronger. I'm glad to be speaking on this topic today with members of the crossbench, which shows the depth of support that this proposal has within this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we've seen the allegations against the Minister for Home Affairs, which have not been denied, that he used the power of his office to help others gain employment with the Australian Border Force. I quote from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> front page yesterday: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton pressed then Customs chief Roman Quaedvlieg to help two Queensland policemen get jobs in the new Border Force agency Mr Dutton was setting up—a revelation set to escalate the political furore surrounding Mr Dutton’s decisions as immigration minister. One of the two policemen, Matt Stock, is a good friend of Mr Dutton’s, according to sources with knowledge of the events. The second man, John Lewis, is the son of corrupt former police commissioner Terry Lewis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Home Affairs has not denied the substance of these allegations, merely stating that he does not believe he has done anything improper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are serious allegations which cannot go unanswered. If the Minister for Home Affairs thinks he can just brush them off and move on, he is sorely mistaken. We are talking here about a minister who created a new agency, Border Force, and then helped two people from his old workplace get jobs in that agency. There are serious questions to answer, and the Minister for Home Affairs has not gone anywhere near to answering them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As strong as this recent case is, the need for a national integrity commission was already there. In recent years there has been a loss of public faith in our Commonwealth institutions. Australia currently ranks 13th out of 176 countries on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. That doesn't sound so bad, but we were sixth on that list just six years ago. In January 2018 a survey of federal public servants by the Australian Public Service Commission revealed that five per cent of respondents had seen misconduct in their workplaces, with cronyism and nepotism the most common charges. With scandal after scandal unfolding over recent years, many involving ministers of the Abbott and Turnbull governments, Labor believes it's time to do what we can to restore the public's faith and trust in their government. Every state and territory either has already established or is in the process of establishing an anticorruption body. It's time we held Commonwealth public officials to the same standard and created a single broad-based body to prevent corruption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's extremely disappointing to hear the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia continue to resist the establishment of a national integrity commission. I suppose it's what we should expect from the government that voted 26 times against the establishment of a royal commission into the banks, but it is disappointing to hear the specious reasons given by the Attorney-General for not backing the establishment of a national integrity commission. The Attorney-General said that the proposal Labor has put forward—and, I can reassure the member for Denison, remains absolutely committed to and will take to the next election—is a vague one, but the fact of the matter is that the proposal we have committed to contains seven detailed design principles. Rightly, in addition to those principles, we have said that the fine grain of the design of a national integrity commission of necessity has to be left to government, because the Commonwealth already has some focused anticorruption bodies, and any national integrity commission needs to mesh with those bodies, but the seven detailed design principles were put out there so that we wouldn't get the somewhat nonsensical answer from the Attorney-General that we hadn't given enough detail. I invite the Attorney-General and the government to re-examine the proposal and the seven detailed design principles Labor has put forward and, having re-examined, change their position and come together with Labor to establish a national integrity commission, because if ever there were an area in which bipartisanship is vital, it's this area.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to support the comments of the Attorney-General on this matter of public importance. The Attorney-General was very specific. He said that he's not closed to this idea and that he's giving it some consideration, but he did rightfully express some concerns. The member for Denison talked about ICAC in New South Wales. Being from New South Wales, we've been able to read these headlines on the front pages of our papers for well over a decade. When it comes to ICAC in New South Wales, we would do well to remember what is known as Blackstone's formulation, which was named after Sir William Blackstone, the 18th century English jurist:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent party suffer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Benjamin Franklin said something similar:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is better 100 guilty persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to ICAC in New South Wales and the lessons that we can learn from ICAC. Yes, they have done some good work. The Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi investigations were good work done by ICAC. Recently we have seen ICAC's investigation, Operation Dasha, into corrupt local council activities, where there have been allegations of blackmail, secret commissions and dodgy rezonings. ICAC are doing good work in that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, that has not always been the case. The royal commissioner—this goes back 25 years—wrote about ICAC in <span style="font-style:italic;">ICAC: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">arrister's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">erspective</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ICAC will ultimately be effective only if its performance justifies its extraordinary powers. If the Commission is to justify those powers it must be scrupulously fair, value the rights of individuals and accept that persons should only be convicted after due process in the relevant court. The experience of the first twelve months is that as a result of ICAC’s actions … great harm has been done to many innocent people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an example of that harm, we only have to look at what was done to Margaret Cunneen. She was hauled over the coals by ICAC, and had agents on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning. After she had been through it, the Solicitor-General announced that there was no wrongdoing and that there would be no charges laid against her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five months after Margaret Cunneen was cleared, the ICAC inspector, the Hon. David Levine AO, RFD, QC, published his report on ICAC's attempted investigation into her. He labelled it a 'debacle', a 'grotesquerie' and the stuff of a family's 'worst nightmare'. He illustrated injustices of illegality and unjust and oppressive behaviour in the aborted investigation. He concluded:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Whatever was captured by happenstance as having been said or done by Ms Cunneen finds no support in reliable, credible or cogent material, let alone material elevated to constitute evidence, of any conduct on her part, let alone of her son or his girlfriend, warranting the intervention and intrusive exploration by one of the most powerful agencies of this State.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think the case has yet been made out for a federal ICAC. We currently have the Australian Federal Police. We have the Australian Crime Commission. We have the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct and the ministerial code of conduct, enforced by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Australian Public Service Commission. Most of all, we have a fierce and independent media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the case that the opposition argues about the Minister for Home Affairs, where two young female tourists from Europe on a tourist visa were given an extension because they were going to act as nannies—if that is the best that the Labor Party can come up with, then the case has simply not been made out for a federal ICAC. I'm encouraged by the comments of the Attorney-General that his mind is not closed to this issue. I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  In an era of declining trust in politicians, it should be essential that the parliament support a commission which holds all politicians, their advisers and senior public servants to account. When the Attorney-General said that we are in the top 20, yes, he's correct; that's true. We're ranked 13th but we were sixth. We are behind. New Zealand is No. 1. Canada, the UK and Germany are all ranked above us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 2012 we have declined from 85 out of 100 points to just 77. The trajectory is not good. Here we are fighting hard for what I believe is such an obviously good idea, and yet, as on so many issues in this parliament, we are dragging the coalition government kicking and screaming to consider it. The Labor Party has at least come out in support of the idea of a national integrity commission. However, it has not provided as much detail as we would like to see about its model, nor has it given us any idea of a time frame of implementation. But at least it is a start.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of models, I'll now briefly explore the common guiding principles for any possible commission models that might be adopted. The most recent authority of investigation of the serious options for an Australian national integrity commission was found in the Griffith University paper—and the member for Bowman talked about the Griffith University paper—called <span style="font-style:italic;">A national integrity commission</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">options for Australia</span>, which came out in August this year. I wish to commend Professor AJ Brown—I believe he's here in the chamber today—and his team, the three universities, and Transparency International Australia, on this paper. I encourage anyone who takes the idea of a national integrity commission seriously to read it in its entirety. I have relied heavily upon it for this speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The paper found that at a federal level there is currently no coordinated oversight of high-risk misconduct; most strategic areas of corruption risk are unsupervised; no coherent system-wide framework for corruption prevention; inadequate support for parliamentary and ministerial standards; low and uncertain levels of resourcing; public and private cross-jurisdictional challenges; and a lack of public accessibility, including a lack of public and private whistleblower support. In assessing the options there should be several guiding principles that should apply across the board. The National Integrity Commission should not just be a carbon copy of state commissions against corruption. At a federal level, we can do better. I understand that many members in this House see flaws in some of the state integrity commissions. That's fine; we can do better—we are the federal parliament. This is a chance for the federal government to lead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I spoke at a rally in support of Witness K and Bernard Collaery, his lawyer—a case that epitomises the importance of effective whistleblower protection for government employees who ventilate serious allegations of government criminality. How can it be, after what we know of this case, that we don't need a federal IBAC? There is a fact: the Australian government at the time in 2004 bugged the East Timor cabinet, and we did that as an Australian government for commercial gain. That to me would be the first matter that a federal IBAC should look at. We need to examine who was involved and who gave the orders. Any possible model that's adopted should also, and I quote from the paper, 'include strong accountability arrangements for the agencies involved, especially those exercising coercive investigation powers.' For example, at a parliamentary level, instead of a collection of specialist parliamentary committees, there would ideally be a single committee that exercises parliamentary oversight of all major integrity agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could talk at considerable length and for considerable time but I'm running out of time. The Australian people demand, expect and deserve more political accountability, and we should give it to them because no-one—and I mean no-one—should be above the law. I seek leave to table the paper referred to: Griffith University's <span style="font-style:italic;">A national integrity commission—options </span><span style="font-style:italic;">for Australia</span>.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  In speaking to this motion, it must be very clearly enunciated from the outset that the Attorney-General is not against this concept. He is very, very clear in saying that, if you are going to develop an IBAC, it has to be done in the correct manner and in the right format. He's listed a litany of New South Wales examples where it seems to have not worked very well, but he's absolutely not ruling out that we should go down this path. What he's saying is that we need to go down this path with caution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example where an IBAC is in place but it doesn't seem to be working very well is in Victoria. With the current government in Victoria they have an absolute litany of examples of frauds and misuse of public money. They have a litany of examples of misuse of resources, of taxpayers' money. We had a minister in Victoria who was using taxpayers' money to have his dogs chauffeured around the state. He thought it was a good use of money for him to organise his own personal chauffeur—that the taxpayer was paying for—to take the dogs out to the weekender and then bring the dogs back into town. The IBAC didn't seem to pick that up. Somehow or other the IBAC didn't have an interest in that sort of misuse of public money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another issue in the Victorian parliament that was a misuse of public money where the Speaker in the Victorian parliament and the Deputy Speaker in the Victorian parliament, both long-term Labor people, both long-term senior Labor figures in Victoria, had made a meticulous decision, a longstanding decision, that they would claim that they were living in a caravan down at the beach, 90 kilometres away from the parliament, as their primary place of residence. Making this claim, for these senior Labor people in Victoria, meant that they were then entitled to about $28,000 per year over a number of years. Both of them misused over $100,000 of the taxpayers' money for their own personal gain, and again the IBAC didn't have anything to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that Labor's lead speaker on this, who himself is a Victorian, happened to just overlook what you might call these errors of judgement—errors of judgement that lasted three years—from these senior Victorian Labor people in his own state. Again, the IBAC didn't inquire into or judge these misuses of Victorian taxpayers' money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we then have the rorts-for-votes scandal, which was another $380,000 rip-off of the Victorian taxpayers. Again the IBAC had nothing to do with this. It was simply raised, and the Labor Party then spent over a million dollars in Victoria fighting to have an inquiry into this issue. The rorts in Victoria, the misuse of the taxpayers' money in Victoria, under a Labor Party government have been absolutely stunning. The theft, effectively, of taxpayers' money for their own purposes has just been incredibly brazen, for everybody to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And this is nothing to do with having to pay back $1.2 billion when you said that you would not cost the Victorian taxpayer one cent. In a sense, the Premier was probably right. He wasn't going to make anyone pay a cent for knocking back the East West Link. He made the Victorian taxpayer pay $1.2 billion for a road that now Infrastructure Victoria has listed as a priority road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the Attorney-General is right that, if we're going to go down this path of putting in place a federal IBAC, we need to make sure it's done in a manner that will have some opportunity to catch some of these incredibly brazen and deceitful members of parliament. We can only beg to understand what was going through those senior Labor figures' minds when they thought it was okay to rip off Victorian taxpayers for the 'red shirts' campaign; it was okay to get your dog chauffeured around the state; and it was okay to tell lies about the fact that where you lived as a primary place of residence was a caravan at the beach.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms McGOWAN:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you very much. I welcome the comments from my colleague and neighbour the member for Murray and absolutely agree with him about the importance of having a national integrity commission to do all the things and address all the issues that need to be done. Like him, I'm a great believer in having fair, open and transparent government. An independent integrity commission is, in my opinion, a really important part of that. In my speech I'll outline what we do to seriously consider an overarching integrity and anticorruption commission and why it matters in my community, and I put a call out to the government to take steps towards strengthening the integrity of all our institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key principles, colleagues, that I use in this place when I'm making decisions and voting is: will it bring good governance? With that background, I don't do deals, and I don't do deals in exchange for confidence or supply, because that's not good governance. I fiercely hold on to my right to vote on every bit of legislation on its merits. The trust and faith of my electorate in this House and the work we do relies on my community trusting and having good faith in the integrity of our system. I support a process where we regularly reassess and strengthen the system of integrity and anticorruption in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why do we need an integrity commission? At the very least, we need a commission to provide coordination and oversight of the many anticorruption efforts of integrity agencies at the Commonwealth level and to link into the work of the state and territory jurisdictions. A federal commission will be in a position to fill the gaps in our current system, to ensure there are investigative powers and to expose corrupt conduct in the federal government and the public sector. We have seen that every state in Australia now has an anticorruption commission that operates alongside other state integrity agencies. They have uncovered many examples of systemic corruption and misconduct that were not found by existing agencies. So I can't be convinced that there's nothing to see here at the Commonwealth level. We only have to look at the impact of the royal commission into the banking sector to see the potential for misconduct to be exposed even when there are existing systems and regulators with oversight. I say let the sun shine in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When compared with state governments, the federal government falls short. No agency can investigate alleged misconduct of members of parliament, ministers or the judiciary. The agencies which do have strong investigative powers, such as the Federal Police, can only use them when investigating criminal charges, and no agency holds regular public hearings. This means corruption and misconduct are not properly exposed to the public and the only avenue for public hearings is through parliament, and this is controlled by the numbers and the major parties. So I think it's no accident today that it's been the Independents and the crossbench that have brought on this MPI.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does it matter for my community? Corruption and misconduct not only undermine the integrity out of our democracy but have a direct impact on the everyday lives of all Australians. It undermines the delivery of government policy and the delivery of services to our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, we are all here at taxpayers' expense and we need to make sure the best interests of Australians are put first and foremost, so today I call upon the government. I call upon the government to take steps towards strengthening the integrity of all our institutions. If they're not willing to support the establishment of an independent integrity commissioner now, today, then tell us how they're going to go about establishing an integrity coordinator—someone or some organisation to work with existing integrity agencies to assess our systems of integrity and anticorruption to at least coordinate what we're already doing. This assessment would identify gaps. It would coordinate activities across government and interaction with the state commissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In bringing my remarks to a close, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I want to commence my remarks in this debate today with a quote: 'The government has no mandate to set up a star chamber. It has no mandate to deprive the citizens of this state of basic civil liberties such as a right to natural justice. It has no right to invade the confidentiality of proper solicitor-client relationships. It has no right to invade the privacy or the confidentiality of the confessional. It has no right to muzzle the media. It has no right to prevent adequate parliamentary scrutiny by the proposed joint parliamentary committee and it has no right to protect the commission from debate and criticism in parliament by abrogating the ancient privileges of this parliament and its members. It has no right to set up an "Australian gestapo", as the President of the New South Wales Bar Association has aptly described it.' Those words are from the distinguished Labor icon and former New South Wales Treasurer Michael Egan in the debate on the first ICAC bill in 1988. Mr Egan's comments have proved prescient in relation to the performance of ICAC over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's with regret that I have to say that a number of the examples that have been given to us by the crossbench and by those opposite have underscored some of the problems of ICAC. Sometimes, to the man with a hammer, every problem is a nail, and so every government problem, it might be said, needs some sort of commission of inquiry or needs a standing ICAC-type body to solve it. Of a couple of the examples that the member for Denison gave us, his first example, the Australian Wheat Board, was, it is to be remembered, the subject of a very extensive royal commission: the oil-for-food inquiry. As for his second main example, in relation to the RBA banknotes scandal, there have now been some prosecutions in relation to that, and on 21 May 2018—a quick Google search demonstrated this—the former RBA officer Clifford Gerathy pleaded guilty to offences relating to that note-printing scandal. So it's not as if things get swept under the carpet. There are proper processes and proper mechanisms at the federal level to deal with such issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Melbourne made much of the case of Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald, and isn't it wonderful that they've gone to jail, and isn't it wonderful that ICAC has done its job in relation to the two of them. I just want to compare and contrast the performance of the New South Wales ICAC inquiry into Ian Macdonald and Eddie Obeid and its performance in relation to two Liberal premiers, Nick Greiner and Barry O'Farrell. Nick Greiner and Barry O'Farrell were as honest as the day is long. They have high reputations in the community today, even having been found in breach by ICAC's particular findings. But all ICAC has managed to do in a political sense is to end the careers of two good, honest Liberal premiers. Yet—despite the fact the Labor Party ran government in New South Wales for 16 years—it was only after the Labor Party had left office that it finally did anything about Eddie Obeid and Ian Macdonald. So there is a complete lack of a level playing field in relation to the performance of ICAC. That's why, in some respects, those on our side of the House are very concerned about a federal facsimile of ICAC—that is, given the highly partisan experience in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David Levine, the former Inspector of ICAC, talked about the undeserved trashing of reputations that happens at ICAC. He said in his report: 'The reality is there's no appeal, in the generally understood meaning of that word, from a finding of "serious corrupt conduct".' Think of the number of people who have been found corrupt at ICAC and have then had those findings overturned, whether it is former SES Commissioner Kear, who was found to have engaged in corrupt conduct by ICAC but was later acquitted by the court; John Booth, the publisher, who was found to have lied to ICAC but then was found not guilty in the local court; or, as the Attorney-General spoke to us of today in his contribution to this debate, the celebrated case—or lamented case—of Margaret Cunneen, the highly regarded New South Wales prosecutor, in which the High Court found that the New South Wales ICAC had exceeded its powers in relation to its findings of corrupt conduct there. The nature of these bodies is that they trash reputations, first, and they overstep their powers. Nick Greiner, who established ICAC, had a few things to say about the nature of ICAC. He said this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The problem from the start was the lack of high-quality commissioners and high-quality counsel assisting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it was former High Court Judge Ian Callinan who once said, 'television cameras and lawyers are not a good mix'. And that's the problem with all of these bodies. The problem is they're often not really about finding corrupt conduct; they're about creating headlines for lawyers, and sensationalism. That's the important thing here. I think we need to be very careful before we go down this route.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been five years, but, finally, this law will enable an equity crowdfunding framework to operate in this country in the right way. It's been five years since Labor first commissioned the initial reviews into how to establish equity crowdfunding in Australia within the confines of the Corporations Act—a way for smart firms and for start-ups to be able to generate capital over the internet to help support their businesses by finding investors willing to support those ideas and back the growth of those new firms. Four years ago, the report of the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee was handed to the coalition government. The government that said it was pro-business, pro-innovation and pro-agility actually took its sweet time to get a legislative framework in place in this place to allow for equity crowdfunding to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might be worth noting that the bill itself, which has been amended in the other place and has come here today for the final tick, was introduced in September 2017. The then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, was told last year that the initial wave of reforms he had put into this place would not be functional, would work against the best interests of start-ups and would hinder the ability to raise capital. He ignored that in the mad pursuit for a headline to say that he had brought in some form of equity crowdfunding. We said to the then Treasurer he would need to reform those laws, and sure enough he had to. He had to come back to that dispatch box and introduce these new arrangements. And then the laws just sat jammed in the parliament, going nowhere. Despite our urging and despite our extension of support to the government to have this happen, it got nowhere. The supposedly pro-FinTech Prime Minister, the person who, as Treasurer, said he would promote innovation in this space, couldn't even find a way to get his own legislation through the Senate to allow for this to occur and, importantly, to allow smaller firms to get access to an alternative capital pathway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, while he couldn't get his legislation through the parliament, we started seeing alternatives arise to this alternative pathway, mainly in the form of initial coin offerings that have been taking off as a way to generate capital for capital-starved start-ups. Fortunately, things changed in all this, after this legislation had been stuck for ages. We couldn't rely on the old Treasurer to ensure that this got moving. It took a new Treasurer to make sure this law actually got put up for a vote in the Senate. I must commend the new Treasurer in agreeing to an amendment by the opposition that we bring forward the start date for this framework. In a collaborative way, both the government and opposition were able to successfully get through an amendment—we proposed it, with government support—to ensure that this new framework takes effect one month after royal assent and that ASIC, which has had time to put the systems in place to support the new framework, do so in an expeditious way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition looks forward to seeing this framework put in place. We support it, and we said to the government we would support them on the ushering in of equity crowdfunding in this country. We look forward to this being a platform to raise money for smart firms to generate strong firms, new jobs and ensure that our country actually gets a framework like this in place. A lot of other countries have managed to get themselves sorted out on this, but we seemed, as always, to lag behind. But at least with a new Treasurer in place, and a new collaborative mindset in place, we've been able to see this equity crowdfunding framework eventually, properly, finally put in place five years after it was first proposed by Labor.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I want to speak briefly on this amendment to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Amendment Bill 2018. This is the third time in two days that I have spoken on a government amendment to its own legislation.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supported the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Bill, which in fact made some new changes that came out of a part of a review of the AIHW, changes to the governance and administration of the AIHW seeking to secure its future as the leading information agency. This came after the government in fact first attempted to merge the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare into the Australian Bureau of Statistics and there was a big fight to try and make sure they didn't actually succeed with that. A review has now, hopefully, protected the AIHW against future raids by this government and its attempts to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill's major provision in fact was to provide for a skills based board, replacing the current board structure in which members are selected based on the groups they represent, and we had no issue with the change. We supported that both here and in the other place. But as I said, this is the third time in just two days that the government has had to amend its own health legislation. Yesterday it was on a fairly non-controversial pathology tax bill and the other one was on a private health insurance bill, both of which required these last-minute amendments because the government is, frankly, incompetent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a pretty sloppy government. As the new Prime Minister has described it, it's been a bit of a muppet show. It's had its eye off the ball when it comes to its legislative program. How can the Australian people have any faith in this government's abilities to govern when it has consistently now, over the last two days, had to amend its own legislation? Maybe if we had the health minister, Minister Hunt, one of the people who was fairly prolific and a part of the plots against the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, concentrating on his day job rather than on tearing down prime ministers and more focused on the work that he had before him, we wouldn't see these sorts of sloppy mistakes being made. This was, frankly, a minor technical amendment to a non-controversial bill in the first place, but still the minister could not actually get it right. Maybe if he was less focused on plotting behind his leader's back, he would not be making so many mistakes when it comes to the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new amendment we have before us is a minor one; it's a date change. We will support the amendment but, as I said, it would be great if the minister and the government could stop their infighting and actually focus on the basics of governing. While the divided Liberals are focused on fighting themselves, they're not focused on Australians and they're certainly not focused on getting their own legislation right in this place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  Slavery is one of the most heinous, most offensive human rights abuses possible. However, shamefully, it is not something consigned to the history books despite the conflicts which featured slavery and anti-slavery forces at their core, including the American Civil War, and despite the high aspirations of the abolitionists of the 19th century. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any time in human history. This has to be a shocking statistic. Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are approximately 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these people are in the Asia-Pacific region, many of them stuck in the global supply chains of products and services that Australians use every day. We, each of us, are part of the problem supporting slavery and we can be instrumental in providing a solution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trafficking and slavery are occurring right here in Australia, in our suburbs and in our communities. The fact that this is happening should not be concealed. According to the Attorney-General's Department, between 2004 and 31 December 2015, the Australian Federal Police took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices. We cannot and should not tolerate either worker exploitation or human rights abuses. Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are thousands of people trapped in slavery right here in Australia that need our help and assistance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The word 'slavery' conjures certain images from long ago, but there is a very modern face of slavery here in Australia that is represented in our communities in a number of ways. Modern slavery can include control of movement; control of a physical environment; psychological control; measures taken to prevent or deter escape; force; threat of force; coercion or deception; assertion of exclusivity; power to use services without commensurate compensation; subjection to cruel treatment and abuse; control of sexuality; and forced labour. We simply must do more to prevent these practices and these types of practices. They need to be reported and called out. An effective, strong, modern slavery act is a key part of that battle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we have before us, the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, would establish a modern slavery reporting requirement to require certain large businesses and other entities in Australia to make an annual public statement on their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. This is a positive development and deserves the support of this House. However, the government has refused to include in this bill penalties for companies that breach the proposed modern slavery act, and have chosen to have what is described as a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commissioner, both of which were contemplated under a Labor policy and the model it proposed. This weak commitment to the most laudable policy objective is disappointing but hardly surprising from a government that has showed itself time and again to be utterly toothless and completely lacking ambition when it comes to regulating big business. Most recently, they've been distracted by their own internal shemozzle and disputes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This weak commitment to this most laudable objective, as I said, is disappointing, but it's particularly disappointing in that over a year ago Labor announced its own modern slavery policy. Our policy announcement included a commitment to establishing a modern slavery act with a transparency in supply chain mechanism which contained penalties for noncompliance and an independent antislavery commissioner. When we announced this policy we called on the government to match our commitment because tackling slavery should be above politics. We all have good reason to make that call-out. Our policy was warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement. As a consequence, we've moved amendments to this bill to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the modern slavery act. We'll be calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor was impressed during the development of our policy with the extensive feedback that we got after an extensive consultation process with business and civil society. Labor continues to be impressed by the genuine passion within both the business community and the broader community, and the commitment to fight slavery. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry tasked with investigating the matter, including the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia and Oxfam, called for penalties to be a key part of this bill. This government can and must do better to tackle this appalling human rights abuse. It is an absolute imperative that any modern slavery act should have penalties for noncompliance. This should be self-evident. It cannot be left to big business alone to police themselves on this important issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are concerns that some companies would not comply with the bill in its current form. There's some instruction from overseas as to that issue. In fact, evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill shows that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that reported—and who supposedly have an obligation to do so—still hovers at around 30 per cent of those. If it's an obligation, it shouldn't be limited to only 30 per cent of people complying. This is not good enough. We have an obligation to do better. Combating slavery should not be optional. There is no excuse for a culture of not looking and not asking. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU, noted that: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The absence of sanctions seriously undermines the effectiveness of the reporting requirements for the purposes of fighting modern slavery. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the ACTU argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In order to make any difference to the lives of workers in Australia and abroad, the Modern Slavery Act must act as a serious motivator for companies to start acting upon the values expressed in their statements and guidelines and provide an effective deterrent for those who fall short of their obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Hence, any Australian legislation enacted should include a strong enforcement mechanism imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with due diligence and reporting requirements. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the organisation Anti Slavery Australia, has said, as to this issue:</span>

Market disclosure is a weak regulatory tool for a variety of reasons, including the fact that consumers may fail to understand the implications of the disclosures, fail to collect the full range of pertinent information, or lack the resources or expertise to fully research issues. Furthermore, consumers’ decisions may continue shaped by economic considerations, rather than adverse human trafficking or slavery disclosures. There is also limited empirical evidence concerning the effect of ethical considerations on consumer behaviour. On the contrary, research has shown that only between 3% and 10% of consumers are willing to modify their purchasing decisions based on social or environmental criteria.  </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, the same organisation continued on to say: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As such, market-regulated disclosure legislation is not appropriate in situations where the risks associated with certain activities is not catastrophic or likely to give rise to grave consequences. Without an adequate penalty or sanction to deter non-compliance with reporting obligations, there is little incentive for organisations to engage with supply chain transparency. The serious risk of criminal slavery and human trafficking being supported and hidden by complex supply chains necessitates a stronger regulatory framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalties for noncompliance of reporting obligations are a key part of Labor's policy, as is the establishment of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims, not just a support unit for big business. I say again: victims deserve an independent commissioner for their assistance, particularly having regard to their weak position. The government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows that their primary concern is, as always, protecting big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, according to the statistics that I've seen, an estimated 4,300 people trapped in slavery in Australia. But, as Senate estimates last year revealed, we only have had seven slavery convictions in half a decade—4,300 people trapped in slavery but only seven convictions. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and to crack down on this sickening crime. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps in enforcement, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU, have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of the independent antislavery commissioner. The Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, for example, in their submission to the Senate inquiry argued that the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner would be vital to securing the cooperation of key stakeholders and increasing successful outcomes. Certainly evidence in the first year after the UK established via legislation its independent antislavery commissioner showed that more victims were identified, more proactive and reactive police investigations were undertaken, more prosecutions and convictions were achieved, judicial awareness was notably increasing and more training was put in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key stakeholders and well-respected independent voices have added powerful support to the proposition advanced by Labor that I'm putting here today. Fiona McLeod SC has stated: 'It is critical that someone independent of government with the capacity to speak to government, NGOs, unions and business holds the office of antislavery commissioner. In-house public servants providing information to the public with no compulsory powers will be inherently weaker and less effective than the creation of an independent officer. Evidence presented through the Modern Slavery Act inquiry process shows that Australia is a world leader in antislavery laws. But the awareness of the laws is low, enforcement is weak—certainly the existence of only seven prosecutions shows that—and there are gaps in communication between civil society and criminal frameworks despite efforts to reduce these.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has set, in my submission, the standard for a policy. The amendments that we propose to this legislation, I think, make right the deficiencies within this bill. Labor will be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a modern slavery act that will actually make a difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd like to add again to the submissions that were made and the public comments that have been made by civil society in connection with this issue of modern slavery. I speak as a former President of the Law Society of Tasmania and a member of the Law Council of Australia. I think that this parliament should listen to the representations made by organisations like the Law Council of Australia. The Law Council of Australia strongly supports the fact that we need tougher penalties in this legislation and we need the independence of that antislavery commissioner. It's vitally important that we consider that this has operation not just within Australia but also within the supply chains that apply to these large corporations. This is something that is a national and international scandal. We have an opportunity to do something about it. We should do it now.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEARNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I'm incredibly proud to rise today to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. As the ACTU president, I had the honour of standing with the member for Hotham to support her announcement over a year ago of Labor's commitment to a modern slavery act. I thank the member for Hotham for the work and time she's put into this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud the Labor Party has led the way with this. Tackling slavery and exploitation is core to our mission. If we are honest, we are only here today debating this bill because the government succumbed to Labor's leadership and pressure. But, like with so many other issues, the government has produced watered-down, less-effective legislation. If the government is going to follow Labor's lead, I wish they'd do it properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to establish a modern slavery reporting requirement to require certain large businesses and other entities in Australia to make public on an annual basis their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. This is long overdue and welcome news, but there are two crucial elements to tackling slavery that this bill is missing: penalties for noncompliance and the introduction of an independent antislavery commissioner. These were put forward by Labor in our modern slavery act, an announcement which was warmly greeted by business, union and civil society stakeholders. Labor is proposing amendments so that the bill includes penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner. These amendments force companies to take seriously their obligations regarding due diligence in their supply chain. If the government won't support them, it will prove they are not serious about tackling the scourge of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my previous role as president of the ACTU I worked with the Labor government on their modern slavery policy. Through this process and my own personal experience in the union movement I learned about the extent and horror of modern slavery. It's not a faraway issue or a distant problem. It's not someone else's issue; it's our issue. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than ever before. The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these poor people are in our region, the Asia-Pacific region, many of them stuck in the global supply chains of products and services which Australians use every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Figures vary with respect to the number of people enslaved in Australia. The Global Slavery Index estimates that there could be around 15,000 people currently trapped in modern slavery right here in Australia. Trafficking and slavery are occurring in our suburbs and communities. That should shock people. When people think of slaves their minds take them to past notions of slavery as an issue which perhaps has been solved. This could not be further from the truth. Research shows that those high-risk areas and industries where workers are most likely to be held in slave-like conditions in Australia are, not surprisingly, industries that engage workers on employer sponsored visa arrangements, where temporary low-skilled migrant workers are trapped far away from home. These workers are vulnerable to forced labour exploitation, starting with exploitation by those who facilitate their journey to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the 2018 Global Slavery Index those industries that are high risk for forced labour include agriculture, construction, domestic work, meat processing, cleaning, hospitality and food services. There are red flags for identifying victims of modern slavery. These include workers being housed in substandard accommodation, illegal pay deductions for food or rent, situations of debt bondage, confiscation of passports and pay well below the minimum wage. There have even been cases of exploitation of domestic workers who have endured and escaped conditions of modern slavery in diplomatic households right here in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Individuals reported withholding of passports, working excessive hours, low wages and threats to themselves or even to their family back home as well as restrictions on their movement. The majority of modern slavery victims identified by authorities to date have been women from Asia who have been exploited within the sex industry. While modern slavery occurs within Australia, the realities of global trade and business make it inevitable that products bought, sold and consumed here have been brought about by enslaved workers just off our shores. The offshore industries most likely to engage in modern slave labour are those involved in making laptops, computers, mobile phones, apparel and clothing, fish products like tinned tuna, and rice and cocoa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a big role to play in fixing this issue. As a country, as a parliament, we simply must do more to prevent this practice. An effective, strong, modern slavery act is a key part of that battle, which is why it is so disappointing that the government has put forward a modern slavery bill without penalties for companies that fail to comply with the act's requirements. This is an incredibly serious misstep, though it's no surprise coming from a government who constantly kowtows to big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially, the government is setting up a scheme that provides a written obligation for companies to do something with no penalties if they don't comply. Companies will be free to decide if they can comply with this or not. That's not good enough. If the royal commission into the financial sector has taught us anything, it is that self-regulation and self-reporting are a farce and don't work. We cannot trust big business to police themselves on slavery within their own business or supply chains. I note with interest that the NAB, one of the star witnesses at the banking royal commission, which has been setting the bar lower and lower every day with allegations of misconduct including charging deceased people fees, does not support the key plank of Labor's amendments—that is, the introduction of an antislavery commissioner. Do we really believe a simple self-report mechanism will work with these big businesses? Evidence provided to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there were no penalties, the percentage of businesses that have reported still hovers around 30 per cent of those who have an obligation to do so. I'm sorry, but that is not good enough. As the ACTU said in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In order to make any difference to the lives of workers in Australia and abroad, the Modern Slavery Act must act as a serious motivator for companies to start acting upon the values expressed in their statements and guidelines and provide an effective deterrent for those who fall short of their obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hence, any Australian legislation enacted should include a strong enforcement mechanism imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with due diligence and reporting requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The risk of noncompliance is real and high and it is obvious that this would severely undermine the effectiveness of the act and the goal to help eliminate modern slavery in supply chains. If the government want to be serious about tackling modern slavery, they must support Labor's amendments. If they do not, they just prove to the Australian people that once again they are utterly toothless when it comes to regulating big business, which brings us to our second point about how the government has completely fluffed this legislation, which lacks the establishment of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. Rather, the government intends to establish a modern slavery business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs. A unit buried deep in the department, charged with engaging with reporting entities, will not be able to fulfil all the tasks that would make the act effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that someone independent of government, with the capacity to speak out to government, NGOs, unions and business, holds the role of the antislavery commissioner. In Senate estimates last year, it was revealed we have only had seven slavery convictions in half a decade. As I mentioned before, the prevalence of modern slavery is far greater than that. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and crackdown on this sickening crime. In the United Kingdom, the independence of the commissioner has been vital in ensuring cooperation from business and in addressing labour exploitation in creative and proactive ways. This has increased reporting of breaches of the act, victim identification and, ultimately, successful prosecutions. The role of the commissioner as someone who can engage with victims of slavery is incredibly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Victims are incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers in wresting themselves free from their situation. They often have a mistrust and fear of police and government authority in general, which is why so many of my colleagues in the union movement have been the ones coming across these workers and trying to advocate for them and for justice. Union organisers are close to the workplace and workers. They build up trust and camaraderie over time, which is vital in helping the victims of forced labour to come forward and speak up. The unions show empathy and compassion and, sadly, often find themselves unable to properly advocate for these workers. In fact, comrades in the CFMEU have been fined for going on site to help workers caught in situations like this. The fact of the matter is the organisers can encourage the use of and provide explanation of the role of an independent commissioner, a concept that hopefully the workers will be more likely to engage with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. As the entrapped victims are mostly from foreign countries, language is a massive issue and interpreters are essential. Many of them have no understanding of their rights as workers, of what their pay and conditions should be, of occupational health and safety, of the industrial relations issues with respect to representation or even joining a union. They have no idea of who to go to for help. They may not even understand the banking system or payment modes or what the employer can charge them for rent or food and so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a responsibility, to workers in this country, for their safety and to ensure they know their rights and can have them enforced. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia. The government's decision to walk away from independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows that their primary concern is, as always, protecting big business with little regard for the real barriers the victims face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Labor's amendments, we propose that the commissioner will also lead our global efforts to fight slavery, including working with other countries and international organisations. It's incredibly important that the government agrees to this. If we are to have any impact on modern slavery in the global supply chains, we will need global cooperation and international instruments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a delegate to the International Labour Conference for many years and had the honour of being elected to the governing body of the ILO. I have seen firsthand the importance of international cooperation and globally negotiated instruments, like standards and conventions, in combating serious issues, like slavery, and in enforcing rights around the world. Indeed, I've had the pleasure and honour of negotiating a number of these with employers and governments, but I also know that working domestically is just as important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I am very proud to speak on this legislation today. It is long overdue. It acknowledges that modern slavery is occurring in our region because of our products and it's our responsibility to fix it. If the government supports Labor's amendments, it will be a bill we can trust will actually go much further to address that responsibility.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  Labor is proud to have led on the issue of modern slavery in Australia. Our proposal for a modern slavery act made by the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, in June 2017, has finally prompted the government to act. We welcome the fact that the government has introduced this bill, the Modern Slavery Bill 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery is a horrific problem that is more prevalent in our society than many realise. It's estimated by the Walk Free Foundation that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of those people are in the Asia-Pacific, where many of the products we buy every day are made. It's fair to say that many Australians would not be aware of the extent of this problem, but modern slavery occurs both in our region and here in Australia—on our streets and in our homes. In fact, there are an estimated 4,300 people trapped in slavery in Australia right now. It's time to do something about that and to take as tough an approach as we can. With this in mind, Labor supports the intent of this bill but believes it can be so much better than it currently is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, this bill imposes a modern slavery reporting requirement which applies to businesses with revenues of more than $100 million a year which are based in Australia or operate in Australia. It requires the company to make a modern slavery statement once a year which details: the entity's structure, operations and supply chains; the modern slavery risks in the entity's operations and supply chains; the actions the entity has taken to assess and address those risks, including due diligence and remediation processes; and how the entity assesses the effectiveness of those actions. This is good detail. However, there is one large problem with the government's proposed bill: this requirement is not enforced in any way. Companies are free to completely ignore this statutory requirement and will face no penalty. In sum, it is a completely toothless law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it says everything about how this government approaches big business. They are too cosy with their big business mates. They are so frightened of standing up to them that they will not even stand up for a cause as important as this. When it comes to regulating big business, this government are just hopeless. We saw it first in their ongoing refusal to hold a royal commission into the financial services sector until the banks asked them for it, and then of course they said yes. They are in the middle of an apparent fight to the death—goodness knows why—to give their big business mates an $80 billion tax cut. Is it surprising that they would commit to the virtue signal of modern slavery reporting requirements without being willing to enforce compliance? Of course not. It's just another part of their pattern of cosying up to their big business mates. On an issue as important as this, we should not leave it to big business to police themselves. Evidence proves it. In the United Kingdom, where they also do not have penalties for not meeting reporting requirements, only 30 per cent of eligible businesses comply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, Labor is committed to strong penalties for noncompliance. Labor wants to see the following added to this bill: firstly, a civil penalty provision for failure to report, with an immediate start date, with 1,000 penalty units to apply; secondly, a civil penalty provision for submitting an inadequate report, with a delayed start date of two years from the date on which the bill receives royal assent, also with 1,000 penalty units to apply; and, thirdly, a requirement that the minister report annually to the parliament on the companies that have failed to comply with the act. We will move amendments to the bill to this effect, and we urge the crossbench to join with us to ensure that the good intent of this bill is made real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another very disappointing element of the government's bill is the absence of an office of an independent antislavery commissioner, as Labor has proposed. Instead, the government is proposing, if you can believe it, something called a modern slavery business engagement unit inside the Department of Home Affairs to support Australian businesses under the new laws. It all sounds very friendly, doesn't it? But it is completely the wrong way around. We want a body to assist victims, not to assist businesses. We want a body that supports victims, not businesses. We want a body to identify issues, if necessary, publicly; not an engagement unit buried within a huge department with, as I understand it, some 23,000 employees. Like so often with the coalition, their priorities are completely wrong. Labor's model of a commissioner would be independent. A commissioner would take a holistic approach to the problem of modern slavery, looking at gaps in law enforcement, encouraging cultural change and examining support services, among other things. A commissioner would play a public advocacy role, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with the former United Kingdom Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, Kevin Hyland OBE, in May this year. Though that position has not been without its problems, Mr Hyland played a vital role in the three years he was commissioner in the United Kingdom. Mr Hyland's position was created, I would note, under a conservative government. Among his achievements, Mr Hyland lists an over 100 per cent increase in the identification of potential victims referred for support, an unprecedented uplift in policing operations, training for the judiciary and a significant increase in public awareness, including a four-month campaign with two newspapers. Mr Hyland also played a regional and global role, including working with the United Kingdom's trading partners and undertaking advocacy at the United Nations. I left my meeting with Mr Hyland in no doubt of the need for Australia to have its own independent antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the government to look at the achievements of Mr Hyland, as I assume they did, and for the government to have looked at the model proposed by Labor for an independent antislavery commissioner and then to suggest that it will be good enough to have a business engagement unit buried in the Department of Home Affairs is simply laughable. Come on! Are they really so blinded by their devotion to big business that they cannot see that their real priorities should be the victims of modern slavery instead? Labor calls on the government, in the strongest possible terms, to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. The bill would be incomplete without it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this government has, oddly and unnecessarily, conflated the issue of forced marriage with modern slavery in this bill. They are related, of course, but entirely separate in terms of how they should be tackled as issues. In fact Labor has an entirely separate policy on tackling the issue of forced marriage. As the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, said when we announced our policy in June this year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Forced marriage is an abuse of human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It can create 'a structure through which subjugation, abuse and sexual assault can occur over decades'. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A failure to adequately prevent, address and respond to this practice is a failure to protect individuals—including young people and children—from crime and abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy to stamp out forced marriage in Australia includes the introduction of forced-marriage protection orders, which will ensure civil protections are available to help all persons at risk of forced marriage, not limited by age. Labor would also provide an additional $2.25 million to civil society groups over four years to adequately resource the key organisations working on the ground to support victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bizarrely, the government has brought forced marriage under the definition of the forms of modern slavery required to be reported on by business. Do not get me wrong: Labor supports efforts to eliminate modern slavery from Australia—it is an abhorrent practice—but requiring businesses to inquire after the marriage status and private lives of their employees is surely not the way to go about it. In fact, this could be completely counterproductive, forcing victims further into hiding. An advocacy group, Good Shepherd, stated in its submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ordinarily it is not the role of business to inquire into the private lives of its employees, contractors or suppliers (or employees of its contractors) in order to identify practices such as forced marriage. If we liken the practice of forced marriage to that of family violence, corporate responsibility lies with supporting the wellbeing of individuals impacted by violence, not in identification and reporting on violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would urge the government to seriously rethink this part of the bill and focus on introducing a separate, strong, forced-marriage policy of its own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In sum, we in Labor are glad the government has finally acted on the issue of modern slavery. It's important that tackling this ghastly problem has bipartisan support. If necessary, we will support even the government's partial solution in the form of this bill. But the government can and must do better. We cannot rely on self-policing in an area as important as this. Penalties are necessary. I urge the government to support our amendments to this bill.</span>

                    <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  I think that, if you spoke to most people about slavery, the perception that they would have is that slavery was something that ended in the 19th century with the abolition of slavery. In 2013, when I was establishing a not-for-profit, non-government organisation, I consulted with Walk Free, which has done some fabulous work in modern slavery, about what some of the challenges were in establishing their not-for-profit. Back then, which is five years ago now, they spoke to me about how increasing awareness of modern slavery and what modern slavery is was probably the first horizon of the work that they needed to do, because there was such a lack of information but also a lack of awareness about what modern slavery actually constitutes. For me to stand up here in parliament five years on and speak in support of a Modern Slavery Act is actually quite momentous when you consider that, just five years ago, it was my very first time to hear about modern slavery, particularly in speaking with a not-for-profit, non-government organisation that dealt in that area. Modern slavery is a term that we use to refer to a whole range of exploitive practices that include slavery and slavery-like conditions such as debt bondage, servitude, forced marriage, forced labour and human trafficking, also referred to as trafficking in persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently a global estimate—and it's only ever an estimate, because it's difficult to collect data on this—of the extent of modern slavery was that on any given day around 40 million people around the world are victims of modern slavery. Compared to this global phenomenon the estimated prevalence of modern slavery in Australia is relatively low, but it does exist here in Australia. There are victims of modern slavery here in Australia, but it is more likely that modern slavery exists in the supply chains for goods and services sold here in Australia and by Australian companies. This bill goes some way in attempting to address this, but I have some reservations, as have been expressed by my other colleagues from this side of the House, about just how far and how effective this bill is, and I'll talk about them in a minute.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill requires that entities based or operating in Australia prepare annual statements on potential modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains and the steps that they've taken to address those risks. Labor's support for this bill is fundamentally about the desperate need for a modern slavery act. As a starting point this bill indicates an awareness of modern slavery and a willingness to at least define modern slavery, but it doesn't go far enough. Several members from this side of the House have spoken about the shortfalls in the bill and the amendments that Labor has put forward to ensure that this bill is impactful and effects much-needed change in addressing modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has a couple of particularly worrying shortfalls. The first is to do with compliance measures. There are no penalties for any of the companies that are found to be utilising modern slavery in their supply chains. On top of that, compliance with the provisions of the bill is voluntary. You don't have to comply, and if you do not comply then there are no penalties for that. Many of the civil society stakeholders have argued that, without any kinds of compliance measures, the supposedly mandatory reporting requirements in the bill are effectively made voluntary. I'll give you some quotes about why this is so important:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Law Council considers that without penalties, a mandatory reporting requirement is rendered merely aspirational—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear a lot about aspiration from that side of the House, don't we? Perhaps this is what they mean—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">as there is no enforcement mechanism, nor any consequence for non-compliance.</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">While the Law Council appreciates that there may be reputational costs for non-compliance, the ability and willingness of civil society to identify non-compliant entities, the media to expose them, and consumers to react appropriately, are easily overstated. In addition, reputational risk does not apply equally to all entities, but mostly to consumer-facing entities.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Law Centre pointed to the low rate of compliance with the UK scheme in making their case for penalties for noncompliance. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the failure to include penalties for non-compliance in the UK has led to extremely low rates of reporting … and even fewer reporting against all of the recommended criteria. It is clear that the threat of reputational damage alone is not a sufficient incentive to ensure compliance, particularly for businesses whose public profile, scale, services or products are not reputation-sensitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the UK's Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner stated in April 2018 that compliance with the UK act's reporting requirements had been 'patchy at best'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While some companies are showing leadership, others are producing generic statements with little substantive detail or failing to produce them at all. In 2017, 43 of the FTSE 100 failed to be compliant with the basic requirements of this legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is the model before us, if this is the example that we have before us, why wouldn't we learn from the mistakes and shortfalls of the UK legislation, really take this seriously and include compliance in this bill?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, what this government has proposed is some kind of fluffy, friendly engagement unit based within the Department of Home Affairs. I'm not quite sure what any kind of engagement unit would do, but I think that several members have spoken quite strongly on the fact that this setting up of an engagement unit shows very much that this government's focus is on appeasing business rather than looking after and looking out for the victims of modern slavery. That's very clear, and I'd like to reiterate that here. The second of those shortfalls is that the bill doesn't provide for an independent antislavery commissioner and doesn't require the government to publish a list of entities required to report, which would actually greatly assist in identifying any entities that failed to report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of the antislavery commissioner, I find it quite interesting because there have been a number of inquiries since I've been in this parliament—at least two that I've found—that make recommendations around a modern slavery act and recommendations about how we should approach this scourge of modern slavery as well as our responsibilities around that. One of them comes out of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which undertook an inquiry into human trafficking as well as antislavery provisions; it was on human trafficking and slavery. They made several recommendations in their report—I'm a member of that committee—I'll go through a couple of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of them is that the committee recommended that the Commonwealth government increase the number of Australian Federal Police officers with specialised human trafficking and antislavery training in all states and territories. Well, I don't see the government doing any of that! It recommended that the government expand training for frontline staff employed by the AFP, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection—which would now be Home Affairs—and the Fair Work Ombudsman with respect to Commonwealth offences, divisions 270 and 271 of the Criminal Code Act 1995.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also recommended that the Commonwealth government considered appointing an antislavery and trafficking commissioner to monitor the implementation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery 2015–19</span>; to provide recommendations, advice and guidance; and to oversee the effectiveness of Commonwealth legislation and policies intended to reduce the prevalence of human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices and respond to corresponding offences. It makes a number of other recommendations, particularly with regard to strengthening visa protections, but, quite interestingly, all of those recommendations are about looking after victims. They have a focus on victims and have a focus on doing something substantive to actually stop modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade had an inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia. The report is called <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in plain sight</span>. Guess what this inquiry recommended? It recommended the introduction of a modern slavery act. Okay. It also recommended provisions for an independent antislavery commissioner; mandatory supply chain reporting that requires certain entities to report on modern slavery risks; measures to support victims of modern slavery, including establishing a national compensation scheme; and measures to improve criminal justice responses to modern slavery. It recommends that the Australian government establish an independent antislavery commissioner under the proposed modern slavery act with powers and resources to undertake several functions, including the overseeing and implementation of a national action plan; investigation and compliance; support services to victims; education guidance and awareness training for government agencies; engaging with government and entities on the implementation and operation of supply chain reporting; collecting and analysing data; undertaking legislated reviews of the proposed modern slavery act at least every three years; improving coordination between criminal justice agencies; providing advice on how to improve the modern slavery act et cetera.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's quite confounding that the government has come up with a modern slavery act that really only touches the tip of the iceberg, that does not go far enough and that does not provide for any kind of substantive action to address the issue of modern slavery—an issue that I earlier said affects 40 million people worldwide and that we know Australian companies are partaking in through their supply chains. It really does nothing to address that at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I reiterate, firstly, our support for the principle of a modern slavery act. It's been a long time coming, and we welcome that. Secondly, I also record my disappointment that this act does not go far enough and that this government hasn't heeded any of the recommendations of inquiries and reports that have been undertaken by this parliament. I reiterate again that, on the amendments put forward by Labor to strengthen the act, including around compliance and for a modern antislavery commissioner, we would be willing to work with the government on achieving those and on achieving real, effective change and effective responses to modern slavery.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  I rise also to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill. When we think about slavery, often this brings to mind images of workers in fields suffering terrible abuse at the hands of their masters and being marched across deserts, and images of chained hands and scars from lashings. Growing up in late 20th century Australia, this is what comes to mind—historical injustices. You wouldn't immediately consider working in a family restaurant in Northbridge as a form of slavery. You wouldn't expect working as a brickie in Southern River as a form of slavery. You certainly wouldn't expect a new marriage in Australia to be shrouding exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is reprehensible that there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are more than 40 million victims of modern slavery in the world today. Right here in Australia, I'm repulsed to say the number of individuals trapped in a cycle of exploitation is estimated to be in the thousands. Human trafficking, slavery and exploitation are occurring in our suburbs behind closed doors. As a country and as a parliament, we are obligated to do more to prevent these practices. A robust modern slavery act is a step in the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill establishes a modern slavery reporting requirement that requires large businesses and other entities to make annual public statements on their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operations and, importantly, in their supply chains. Many of these big companies have already experienced cases of modern slavery in their supply chains and have found them, and are now leading the charge in combatting this deplorable practice once and for all. Even mining magnate and founder of the Walk Free Foundation, Andrew Forrest, discovered slavery in the supply chain of his own Fortescue Metals Group in 2012. Thousands of workers connected to one of our country's biggest companies were earning next to nothing and their passports were being held to ransom by their employer. Upon finding this, Mr Forrest said the supplier claimed no knowledge of these slavery-type practices and their response was instantaneous: passports were returned, illegal recruitment fees were back paid and major overhauls were made to ensure this did not happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's proactivity like this from big business that will ensure modern slavery is then tackled head-on, but we need to support them in doing so; we need to ensure that there is a level playing field for them. This bill will ensure that businesses are constantly reviewing their supply chains and business practices so that they can catch out this dastardly behaviour in their supply chains and bring financial pressure to bear in an effort to eradicate such modern slavery. The bill requires entities with annual revenue of more than $100 million to make a public statement on a yearly annual basis of their actions to address modern slavery risks in their operation and their supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor support this bill, but we feel that this bill doesn't go far enough. Tackling slavery and exploitation is core to Labor's mission and in no way, shape or form do we tolerate worker exploitation or human rights abuses of any kind. We recognise that modern slavery is a hidden problem that won't be discovered without meaningful attempts to expose it and requirements on businesses to check their supply chains to that end. It's why, over a year ago, Labor committed to legislating a modern slavery act with penalties for noncompliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe the bill now before the House should include a strong enforcement mechanism, imposing penalties on those who do not comply with the act. We recognise that the implementation of this reporting obligation will be significant for all companies, so we worry that, without penalties, companies may not be sufficiently incentivised to comply with the bill's requirements. The reason for our scepticism is not unfounded. Last year's Senate inquiry heard that, in the three years since the implementation of the UK's similar antislavery act, only about half of the 11,000 or so organisations that were required to report had produced their slavery and human trafficking statements. Combatting slavery should not be optional. It is an obligation of a progressive society such as ours. We cannot turn our eyes away from what is occurring. Bad things happen when good people say and do nothing. There is simply no excuse for not looking. This is why we are moving amendments to introduce penalties for failing to comply with the modern slavery act provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not alone in this mindset, with the overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to last year's Senate committee inquiry calling for penalties to be included in the bill as well—organisations like the Human Rights Law Centre, who told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill should be amended to include a robust enforcement framework, including penalties for entities that fail to report or provide inadequate, false or misleading information. Penalties should include both financial and non-financial penalties …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sentiments were echoed by Anti-Slavery Australia, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, Oxfam, Stop the Traffik, the Law Council of Australia, the Advisory Committee of the Modern Slavery Registry, the ACTU, the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia—and that is not all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These supply chain reporting requirements must divulge specific information, including information about the company's supply chain where risk has been identified in that supply chain, what steps are being taken to ensure slavery isn't part of that supply chain and how they are training staff to manage all of this appropriately. A list of the companies required to report will be publicly available for the sake of transparency and a central repository of statements will ensure each company is meeting their obligations, or at least allow the public to check. It's only through such steps that this parliament can take the first steps to combating modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conjunction with this, we are calling on the government to remove forced marriage from the reporting requirements. Stakeholders are concerned the inclusion of forced marriage will have unintended consequences. After all, it is not ordinarily the role of business to inquire into the private lives of their employees. It is up to businesses to support employees that might find themselves in family violence situations and possible forced marriage. But we do not believe it is appropriate for this form of modern slavery to be addressed in this particular bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are well aware Australia's current approach to forced marriage is not working. Under the current government, we haven't had a single successful prosecution of forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Of course, that doesn't mean that it's not happening. We instead propose that we should establish a forced marriage unit to provide a one-stop shop to connect victims to the support that they need and to remove the cooperation requirements as part of our forced marriage protection order, among other things. We ask the government to match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment, in order to give these victims the support they need, rather than driving this repulsive practice further underground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also ask that the government go back to the drawing board and propose a second reading amendment in this House to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. This current bill proposes a modern slavery business engagement unit. Essentially, this would be a unit buried in the Department of Home Affairs, focused on assisting business in fulfilling their reporting requirements, but not actively helping victims to get the help that they need. This will not be seen as a solution to the problem and it won't do anything to assist the thousands of people trapped in slavery in Australia now. We call on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner, because we know victims in Australia deserve more than another bureaucratic big business liaison unit. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims and to remedy the current gaps in law enforcement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year's Senate estimates revealed we only had seven slavery convictions in Australia in the last five years. Victims of modern slavery are often some of society's most vulnerable. They are often individuals with cultural, social economic and language disadvantage. An independent commissioner would have the capacity to not only support these victims after the fact, but to work with civil society to prevent and detect this sickening spiral of crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The underground nature of slavery makes it very difficult for authorities to detect and even more complex to investigate and prosecute. The intention would be for the commissioner to work with victims of slavery to resolve inquiries and complaints. In addition, they would have the capacity to assist business to build best-practice structures and to receive inquiries and complaints. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the implementation of an independent commissioner, we would be following in the footsteps of the similar legislation that is currently in place in the United Kingdom, France, California and the European Union. Through this approach, we would expect the commissioner to work with these other countries and international organisations to lead the global effort to fight slavery. A number of consulted key stakeholders are in support of this proposal, including the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans, Anti Slavery Australia and Walk Free. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stop the Traffik told us: 'There are at least six government departments whose engagement and action will be required to implement the act effectively. An independent commissioner would be able to work with these departments in a more effective manner than one department. It is the nature of government departments that they are siloed with different priorities and different ministers. Through an adequately supported and resourced independent commissioner, this matter would be given the priority status that it deserves.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Lawyers Alliance furthered this thought, saying that an independent commissioner would 'strengthen Australia's response to combatting modern slavery'. They said it could undertake the legislated review of the modern slavery act every three years to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the legislation and hold big business to account for compliance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not oppose this bill in the House, as the passage of this bill is vital to combat the scourge of modern slavery. However, we do implore this government to add penalties to the bill, remove forced marriage and re-evaluate the need for an antislavery commissioner. By enacting a robust modern slavery act in Australia with these amendments, this parliament in a bipartisan manner will be ensuring we are doing all that we can, as we should, together, in modern 21st century Australia, to eradicate modern slavery during our lifetime. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. I do so because this is a very important bill being debated here in parliament. Members of parliament should make it our mission to stand up for those who are some of the most vulnerable people in our communities, for those who need us to be their voice, and I couldn't think of a better way to do so than in the debate on this particular bill, which deals with modern slavery in today's world. As we heard from other speakers earlier, you would think that slavery ended in the 19th century. But, unfortunately and sadly, it exists today. It exists all around the world and even here in our own nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill, I suppose, is to establish a reporting requirement that requires certain businesses and other entities in Australia to make annual public statements on their actions to address modern slavery—the modern slavery risks in their operations and supply chains. I'm proud to say that this was a Labor initiative for fighting modern slavery. Over a year ago, Labor committed to a modern slavery act with penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner in an announcement which was warmly greeted by businesses, unions and civil society stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. There are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. As a country, as a parliament, we simply must do more to prevent this horrible, horrendous practice, and an effective modern strong slavery act is a key part of this battle. A year ago, on this side of the House, we committed to a modern slavery act with penalties, as I said, and an independent antislavery commissioner. It was deeply disappointing that the government's put forward this bill, which we'll be supporting because it's a way forward, but without penalties—in other words, a toothless tiger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commission or commissioner—I mean, honestly, a business engagement unit! Let's deal with the victims of modern slavery, not set up a toothless tiger that engages but doesn't enforce. Let's not be fooled here. This isn't the carrot-and-stick approach; it's all carrot. There is no stick—it's enough carrot to embarrass Bugs Bunny! This weak commitment is so disappointing but hardly surprising from this government that has shown itself time after time to be utterly toothless when it comes to regulating big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have an opportunity to actually do something about slavery to ensure that big businesses do have a process or a system in place that ensures that their supply chain doesn't engage in slavery. But if there is no incentive, if there is no stick at the end of it, why go through it? Unfortunately, without any way of enforcing this through fines, et cetera, I just can't see it taking off and being an instrument that will curb slavery. It's a weak commitment. It's disappointing but, as I said, it is hardly surprising from a government which, from time to time, has shown itself to be utterly useless when it comes to regulating big businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absence of penalties in this bill is absolutely baffling. We cannot leave it to big business to police themselves on slavery. We are talking about slavery; we are not talking about something minor. We could take this government's explanation and say: 'Okay, let's see how a no-penalty model goes. Maybe we're the first to do this.' Well, you'd be wrong. We heard other speakers speak on this earlier: evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that have reported, of those that supposedly have an obligation to do so, still hovers around the 30 per cent mark. There it is: no penalty, no difference. It fails the test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Civil society has argued passionately for companies who breach the Modern Slavery Act to be penalised. The overwhelming majority of stakeholders who gave evidence to the Senate inquiry, including the Human Rights Law Centre, the Law Council of Australia, Oxfam and FECCA, all called for penalties to be included in the bill. Labor will be moving amendments to introduce penalties into this bill, because combatting slavery should not be optional. There is simply no excuse for not looking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need an independent commissioner to assist victims who are trapped in slavery in our towns and cities, and to lead our nation's fight against this practice within our region. We heard some examples earlier of how it takes place here in Australia. Women are being sent over from Asia to work in horrendous situations, being told they'll be doing something else, and they are not able to leave because their families may be bonded back home. They're trapped in slavery right here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's estimated that an incredible 4,300 people are currently trapped in slavery here in Australia. These are the victims of modern slavery. Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers, especially when they're away from their own country. There are also significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. An independent antislavery commissioner is urgently needed to deal with these issues, to help remedy these gaps in enforcement, to help the victims and to work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit—the title tells you all. It shows that the government's primary concern is, as always, protecting big business instead of looking at the victims here, who are the vulnerable ones. Key stakeholders, including Anti-Slavery Australia, the ACTU, FECCA and many more, have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we'll be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a modern slavery act that will actually make a difference. We'll also introduce forced marriage protection orders to provide civil protection against forced marriage for all victims, no matter their age. Currently there are no protection orders available for victims or persons at risk of forced marriage who are over the age of 18 years. When a victim or at-risk child turns 18, any pre-existing order is automatically lifted and ceases to protect them. We know that forced marriages don't stop at 18; they still take place well into any age. Many victims of forced marriage are over the age of 18 and victims who are children are likely to continue to face threats right up to early adulthood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Shorten Labor government will overhaul Australia's response to forced marriage. Let's not forget that potentially a thousand young Australians are at risk of forced marriage each and every year. Forced marriage is no different than slavery; you are being forced into a situation that you don't want to be in. Forced marriage is an abuse of human rights. It can create a structure through all sorts of things. Abuse and sexual assault can occur over decades. A failure to adequately prevent, address and respond to this practice is a failure to protect individuals, including young people and children, from crime and abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's current approach to forced marriage isn't working. Under this government, we've not had a single successful prosecution of the forced marriage offences under the Criminal Code. Victims have limited civil protections and struggle to access government funded support. This is a disgrace, and it demonstrates that we need an independent commissioner to provide some teeth to make sure it's taken seriously, because we know that when you allow businesses to self-regulate in most cases it doesn't work. You need an outside, independent body that can come in and ensure that things are being done properly. This is important, because, as I said at the beginning of this speech, slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. There is nothing worse than being held against your will, whether it be in a work situation or in a marriage situation or in any other situation where you're doing things that you don't want to be doing. There are more people trapped in slavery today, in this year, than there ever have been in the history of mankind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a country and as a parliament, we have an absolute duty to do what we can to simply prevent this practice. You need an effective, strong, modern slavery act. It should be part of the battle. It should have an independent commissioner, and it should ensure that we also have fines for people who aren't adhering to this particular instrument. I'm very pleased that we've moved some amendments to this bill, and that a year ago we committed on this side to a modern slavery act with penalties and with an independent anti-slavery commissioner. I know that the announcement that we made was actually warmly greeted by businesses. We heard a great example of a particular mining company earlier. Our announcement was greeted warmly by businesses and civil society and unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm deeply disappointed that the government has put forward this particular bill, a bill with no penalties, and has chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commissioner. It is a weak commitment by this government. It's tokenism and it's disappointing, but hardly surprising, coming from a government who panders continuously to big business. But this is not about whether you're on the side of business or whether you're on the side of unions; this is about human beings and their lives. This is about people who are forced to do things, not of their own free will. I suppose this bill is one way forward. There are the amendments that we've put forward and I know, if we are in government, we will put things in place that will actually ensure that businesses do what they can along their supply chain to ensure that their company isn't involved in any slavery acts whatsoever. We'll also ensure that there is an independent commissioner that can look into these things.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  My wife is American, and earlier this year we took the kids along to the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia. There is a display there that puts in stark relief the experience of slave sales. There is a place in the museum where you can stand on a slave auction block and hear recordings put together by actors. It allows you to visualise what it would be like: the horror of coming off a ship and then being sold. If there's one statistic that sums up the sheer cruelty of the American slavery scheme, it is that one in three slave children were sold before their 10th birthday. We look back at this experience in the United States with horror, but yet there is much slavery still in the world today. The Walk Free Foundation estimates there are 40 million victims of modern slavery worldwide, two-thirds of whom are in the Asia-Pacific region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in Australia, the Attorney-General's Department estimates that between 2004 and 2015 the Australian Federal Police took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices. That's why Labor, last year, recognised the importance of the issue of modern slavery in announcing our modern slavery policy. I pay tribute to the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Isaacs; the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham; Senator Lisa Singh; and many others in Labor who worked to produce this policy. It was a policy warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement. We were joined by representatives from the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU and the Salvation Army. Our policy ensured that there would be penalties for noncompliance and an independent antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has brought forward this bill in large part due to pressure from Labor and other civil society groups that have campaigned on the issue of modern slavery. But it has failed to put in place as part of this bill a regime of penalties and an independent commissioner. Penalties have been called for by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Anti-Slavery Australia, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, Oxfam, Stop the Traffic, the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria, the Advisory Committee of the Modern Slavery Registry, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, the Top End Women's Legal Service and Fiona McLeod SC. An independent commissioner has been called for by Fiona McLeod SC, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Business Council of Australia, Project Respect, the Australian Lawyers Alliance, Anti-Slavery Australia, the synod of Victoria and Tasmania Uniting Church in Australia, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, Good Shepherd Australia and New Zealand, the Top End Women's Legal Service, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Salvation Army, Oxfam and Stop the Traffik. These organisations recognise the importance of a regime which has strong penalties and an independent commissioner. Labor will be moving appropriate amendments to this bill to see those issues better resolved, and we hope the government will support those amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the treatment of domestic workers employed by foreign diplomats in Australia. I will begin with a case study that is highlighted in a report produced the Freedom Partnership to End Modern Slavery—a project of the Salvation Army. It is about Cristina, and I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cristina (pseudonym) was recruited to work for a foreign diplomat in Australia. Cristina had a written contract that said she would be paid $2,150 per month for 40 hours per week as a livein housekeeper. From the time she arrived, Cristina’s conditions and pay were not as agreed. Her employer took her passport, refused to let her go out, and forced her to work seven days per week. She was not paid according to her contract and was forced to sign false declarations about payment of her salary. Cristina’s employer warned there were cameras in the house watching her. Cristina’s employer also threatened that there were many poor people in her country where 'there is a lot of corruption and a man’s life is only worth $100.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She was ultimately able to escape. Other cases of domestic workers indicate Christina's situation was not an anomaly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are challenges in Australian authorities cracking down on the mistreatment of domestic workers employed by foreign diplomats. The Salvation Army notes that, historically, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 'has referred employment disputes to the<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  "> Fair Work Ombudsman, which, in turn, has declined to investigate on the basis of immunity', and if employer sponsorship is revoked—which is a common response to worker complaints—they 'have only 28 days</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:7pt;&#xD;&#xA;  "></span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">before being legally required to leave Australia', which makes it in practice 'impossible to bring a private civil action'. </span>Not all diplomats enjoy the same degree of immunity, but immunity from prosecution does make the resolution of cases involving mistreatment of domestic workers for foreign diplomats more difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Salvation Army, there are approximately 150 private domestic workers currently employed by diplomats and foreign officials—most of them concentrated here in the ACT. The Salvation Army note that they have assisted dozens of workers who have come to them over the years, including at least 11 workers employed by diplomats or foreign officials in Australia. At least four of those cases involved a head of mission. They quote a survivor trafficked into domestic servitude by a foreign diplomat posted to Australia, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For me this is not just about the wages that I am owed and the time that I have lost fighting for my rights. It is bigger than that. It is about justice for a group of people who are not treated as human beings. Their freedom and their labour are being stolen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a significant issue for many in the ACT who want to see proper conditions provided to all workers in the ACT, whether or not they're working for embassies or high commissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Heather Moore of the Salvation Army, who has been a passionate and tireless voice on this issue, has noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The US has made … progress, having amended its federal anti-trafficking laws to enable trafficking victims of diplomats and employees of international organisations to pursue civil lawsuits without fear of deportation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Moore notes:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The US based Human Trafficking Pro Bono Legal Centre and others have brought 25 civil suits against diplomats.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not all of those have been resolved in favour of the plaintiff, but there have been a number of out-of-court settlements. She also notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In Switzerland, the Protocols section offers mediation services for employment disputes and refers workers to NGOs for support when more serious allegations are made. In Ireland, workers must report … for welfare checks and diplomats are now required to permit labour inspections and allow workers to attend workshops on their rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that we in Australia ensure that those who are working at foreign embassies are treated according to Australian law. They may technically be on foreign soil, but they are our responsibility. Because they are workers performing work in Australia, it is the moral responsibility of the Australian government to see that those workers are not subjected to a form of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This mistreatment of domestic workers in foreign embassies and high commissions must receive stronger attention from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I urge that department to work more constructively with organisations such as the Salvation Army to ensure that those who are affected by modern slavery in diplomatic missions here in Canberra don't slip through the legal cracks and that their rights are upheld.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is welcomed by this side of the House. As I noted in my opening remarks, we would have liked to have seen it sooner, and we would like to see it include an independent commissioner and penalties. Beyond that, we urge the government to take all reasonable steps to also ensure that they work with diplomatic missions to ensure that there is no domestic worker in an Australian diplomatic mission subject to modern slavery.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018, because the fact is that there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. That's a very disturbing fact. It seems unbelievable, but it is true. I rise to speak on this bill very proudly, because many of my constituents in my electorate of Wills have a very strong social conscience and many have been writing to me about the implementation of a modern slavery act for many, many months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Walk Free Foundation estimates that there are 40.3 million victims of modern slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of these are in the Asia-Pacific region. We have come so far on so many things, and yet in our own region, in our own suburbs and in our own communities trafficking and slavery are still occurring. It's true to say, and I think the previous speakers have touched on this, that Australia has a critical role, frankly, to play in fighting modern slavery. Trafficking and modern slavery are hidden problems that will not be eradicated without meaningful attempts to expose them. It is our responsibility to do so. It is our responsibility to do everything in our power to prevent human trafficking and exploitation, so a strong, effective modern slavery act as an integral part of that responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's our moral responsibility to our fellow human beings to do whatever we can to prevent human rights abuses and exploitation. That is why tackling slavery and exploitation is core to Labor's mission to protect the vulnerable, to protect workers and to implement and enforce human rights. I'm proud to stand with a party that is so committed to doing so. That's why last year the Labor Party announced our modern slavery policy, a policy that was welcomed by business, civil society and the union movement. I want to acknowledge all the work that was done by our shadow minister for justice, Clare O'Neil, and the commitment that she's shown to this policy in introducing it and announcing it publicly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But tackling slavery must be above politics. That is why Labor has called on the government to match our commitment in establishing the act. We further called on the government to match the commitment to a transparency-in-supply-chain mechanism that contains penalties for noncompliance and to an independent antislavery commissioner. In putting forward this particular bill, the government have finally agreed—they caved in, if you want to put it that way—but have neglected to include the penalties for companies that breach the proposed act. They have also chosen to have what's called a business engagement unit rather than have an independent antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A modern slavery act must have penalties for noncompliance. It's a no-brainer. The coalition had an opportunity during the Turnbull government and now under the Morrison government to work with us in a bipartisan fashion on this bill and to match the commitments that we made when we announced our policy. Frankly, the government's commitment is weak, and we can't afford to be weak on human rights abuses. The government can and must do better. Combating slavery cannot be optional—there is no excuse for that—but unfortunately it's not very surprising coming from a government that has continued to prove itself really useless at regulating big business. We should not be leaving it to big business to police themselves on slavery.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalties, therefore, are vital to the success of this act. The experts know this and have been absolutely clear about it. In submissions to the Senate inquiry, the ACTU, Anti-Slavery Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, Oxfam and many other organisations all spoke of the importance of penalties in effectively exposing and preventing human trafficking and exploitation. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU, said in their submission:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The absence of sanctions seriously undermines the effectiveness of the reporting requirements for the purposes of fighting modern slavery.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overwhelming majority of stakeholders have called for penalties to be included in this bill. It is on this clear advice that we will be moving amendments to introduce penalties for failing to comply with any modern slavery act. It is also on the advice of these independent experts that we move amendments to institute an independent antislavery commissioner. A commissioner will work with victims, assist businesses to establish and protect transparency in supply chains and work to prevent and detect slavery in Australia. A commissioner will provide independent assessments, uninfluenced by other interests, on the effectiveness of the government's actions to fight slavery. It will scrutinise the government's work to tackle modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government has once again prioritised protecting big business over the estimated 4,300 people who are trapped in slavery in Australia today. This decision, against all advice, to propose a business engagement unit in place of an independent commissioner, makes it perfectly clear that protecting themselves and protecting big business is their primary concern when their primary concern should be the thousands of people in Australia who are trapped in slavery and exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We call on the government to establish an independent antislavery commissioner. We call on the government to prioritise the victims, not a support unit for big business. It has been seen in the United Kingdom that the institution of an independent commissioner meant more victims identified, more proactive police investigations undertaken, more prosecutions and convictions achieved—substantive results. It has been seen in similar legislation in France, in the US state of California and across the European Union that the evidence backs in the importance and the critical role of an independent commissioner. The stakes, frankly, are too high to ignore those facts. It is clear that a modern slavery act will be weaker without an independent antislavery commissioner, and a business engagement unit is an utterly inadequate alternative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have before them an opportunity to markedly strengthen the accountability framework of the bill and they are missing it. The victims of slavery in Australia deserve better. These amendments cannot be optional if this bill is to be effective. It is a complex and nuanced issue; we all know that. It cannot be taken lightly or without the proper advice. That is exactly why Labor took the time to consult with stakeholders about concerns the bill includes forced marriage as one of the forms of exploitation required to be reported on by business. It is also why Labor has committed to overhauling Australia's response to forced marriage. I want to acknowledge the work of our shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham, Clare O'Neil, on this particular aspect of the policy work as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forced marriage is an issue that needs to be dealt with properly, not flippantly, so if the government want to actually address it, they should match Labor's forced marriage policy commitment to establish forced marriage protection orders and a forced marriage unit to connect victims with the appropriate services and agencies that can assist them. Clearly, Australia's current approach to forced marriage is not working. Something has to change. But the inclusion of forced marriage in the modern slavery act may drive forced marriage underground, so it needs to be handled with care and in consultation with the experts, just as Labor's comprehensive commitment does. A Shorten Labor government, if elected, will ensure we lead a coordinated national response to combatting the practice of forced marriage. It will ensure that an overhaul of Australia's response to modern slavery, trafficking, human rights abuses and forced marriage. Our policy commits us to stamping out these atrocious practices. It is focused on prevention and on the support of vulnerable victims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I speak to this bill and, as many of the previous speakers on our side have, call on the Morrison government to match the Labor Party's commitments in this policy area. Again, I call on the government to listen to the advice of expert stakeholders who know firsthand what is necessary for real and effective change. We all, I know, speak on this bill because there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history, a terrible statistic. An Australian modern slavery act will ensure that Australia is at the forefront in the fight against modern slavery.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I rise to place on record and, like many of my colleagues and those opposite, to show my support for eradicating modern slavery. My remarks tonight probably will be in a similar theme to most speakers on this issue tonight. Whilst it probably won't make the news tonight or even be talked about across dinner tables while people are picking up their groceries on their way home or sitting in transport, waiting to get home to their loved ones, it is indeed a serious issue. After researching in preparation for this legislation and reading some of the evidence, it's a far bigger problem than most Australians and people across the globe would expect it to be. I know I was one of those people who was genuinely horrified and shocked about the true nature of modern slavery. As MPs in this place, we have a duty to stand up for those who find themselves in vulnerable circumstances—I certainly pride myself on that as an elected representative in this chamber—and the sad issue of modern slavery certainly fits this category.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modern slavery is a term that can be used to describe a range of extreme labour rights abuses including: slavery, servitude, human trafficking and forced or compulsory labour. If you were to ask someone out on the street or across Australia whether slavery still exists today, the answer you'd get, no doubt, would be no. There's no denying that slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. But there are more people trapped in slavery in the world today than there have been at any other time in human history. Let's just unpack that for a minute. Across our history, across this world, there are more people trapped in slavery than there have ever been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though almost every country in the world has laws against slavery and the practice was banned globally by the United Nations in 1926 and again in 1953, modern slavery continues as an issue of huge proportions. Indeed, the Human Rights Law Centre estimates that there are currently in excess of 25 million slaves worldwide, including almost 5,000 right here in Australia. It's hard to believe, and it's hard to understand. According to the Attorney-General's Department, between 2004 and 31 December 2015 the AFP took 619 referrals for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like practices, meaning that there are many more who go unnoticed and without the help they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that the Labor Party has been at the forefront of this fight. We continue that fight here today because all of us, in this chamber and outside this chamber, do not tolerate human rights abuses. We recognise that modern slavery continues to be a hidden problem that will not be resolved without meaningful attempts to expose it. That's why last year, after months and months of consultation with stakeholders, Labor announced our modern slavery policy. We met with not only not-for-profit organisations working at the coalface against modern slavery but businesses and groups such as the BCA; ACCI, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Wesfarmers; Rio Tinto; BHP Billiton; Woolworths; Ernst &amp; Young; and Fortescue Metals Group, just to name a few. That is because we are serious about an inclusive policy that works alongside the not-for-profits, the business sector, advocacy groups and community to stop modern slavery. What resulted was a constructed and strategic policy to help the thousands of victims right here in Australia and the millions and millions of people trapped in slavery worldwide, many of whom are victims of exploitation in private sector activities such as manufacturing, construction and agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has an important leadership role to play in fighting modern slavery. Two-thirds of people trapped in slavery worldwide are reported to be in the Asia-Pacific region. I was pleased at the time to see our policy warmly greeted by business, civil society and the union movement, and we were joined by representatives from the BCA, the Business Council; the ACTU; and the Salvation Army. Our policy announcement included a commitment to establishing a Modern Slavery Act with transparency in a supply-chain mechanism which contained penalties for noncompliance and, most importantly, the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to be here today with members of the government—I note there were five government members who spoke on this important bill today—and join with the government, who are now following Labor's crackdown on modern slavery. I applaud them for that, and I recognise the government's response to strengthen Australia's response to modern slavery by establishing a modern slavery reporting requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, like most things this government produces, it falls well short of what I believe is required and is accepted. This includes the government refusing, as we've just heard from the member from Wills and other speakers—and no doubt the member for Canberra and the member for Bendigo, who are in the chamber tonight, will endorse this—to include penalties for companies that breach the proposed Modern Slavery Act. Yes, it seems there's no piece of legislation where this government wants to offend big business. I simply ask the question tonight: what's the purpose of this legislation if it doesn't have the teeth needed to impose penalties on businesses which continue to flout it and, dare I say, profit from modern slavery?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any modern slavery act must have penalties for noncompliance. We should not be leaving big business to police themselves on slavery. In the three years since the United Kingdom implemented a similar ban only approximately half of the 9,000 to 11,000 organisations the UK government estimates are required to report have produced a slavery and human-trafficking statement. The evidence is clear: this type of self-reporting system simply does not work, so why has the government chosen to have a business engagement unit instead of an independent antislavery commission? According to an ABC report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Adeline Lambert is the director of analytics and customer experience at Made In A Free World, an organisation that works with businesses to stop human trafficking and modern slavery in supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As it stands, the bill does not impose any penalties, financial or otherwise, on companies who fail to report slavery risks in their supply chain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because of this, Adeline Lambert said "companies could look at this bill and say 'there's a way we can get around this'."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Keren Adams, a Director of Legal Advocacy at the Australian Human Rights Law Centre, agrees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"A mandatory reporting scheme is not really mandatory if there are no consequences for companies that fail to comply," she said in a statement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I ask members of the government: what's the point of this bill if there are no penalties? Without financial penalties and an independent commissioner to help enforce them, these new laws lack the necessary teeth to ensure the worst offenders lift their game. The list of stakeholders who support the introduction of penalties in this bill is long and wide. I read into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> a number of these, including, unsurprisingly, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Law Council of Australia, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Queensland University of Technology Faculty of Law, Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and the Australian Lawyers Alliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to see that Labor is moving amendments to this bill to introduce penalties for companies that fail to comply with the modern slavery act and is calling on the government to establish an office of an independent antislavery commissioner. We need an independent commissioner to assist victims, not just a support unit for big business. They are not the victims in this horrendous modern slavery trade. The support for an independent antislavery commissioner is strong out in the community, including in the following submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Law Council is concerned that the Bill does not establish an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner (<span style="font-weight:bold;">Commissioner</span>). In the Law Council's view, the case for an Anti-Slavery Commissioner was well-made in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in Plain Sight </span>report, which notes that it would complement the existing roles of the Attorney-General's Department and the Ambassador for People Smuggling and Human Trafficking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Lawyers Alliance added, with reference to that same report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee was clearly of the view that an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner could play a vital role in strengthening Australia's response to combatting modern slavery. In particular, the Committee envisaged that the Commissioner would undertake a legislated review of the Modern Slavery Act every three years after its commencement, to assess the effectiveness of the Act, the level of public awareness of modern slavery and the effectiveness of the operation of the proposed supply chain reporting requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the Business Council of Australia said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are open to any form of independent oversight, like the UK Anti-Slavery Commissioner model, if it works constructively with businesses to lift performance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead the government's decision to walk away from an independent commissioner in exchange for a business engagement unit shows in my view where their primary concern is. Good Shepherd Australia New Zealand noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Business Engagement Unit is not an adequate alternative to a Commissioner particularly given their own reporting requirements under the law—and their necessary relationships with business outside of the context of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor's modern slavery act would require large companies to report annually to the government on the steps they've taken to ensure modern slavery is not occurring in their business or supply chain through a slavery and human-trafficking statement. Each statement must include specific information about the company's supply chain, where a risk has been identified in that supply chain, what steps are being undertaken to ensure slavery is not part of the supply chain, what training is provided to staff on these matters, whether slavery has been found in the supply chain and then what action has been taken subsequently. Despite the huge numbers I read out earlier that indicate we have almost 5,000 modern slaves in Australia tonight at this very moment in time, recent Senate estimates revealed that we've had only seven slavery convictions in half a decade. Simply put, that's unacceptable. We urgently need a commissioner to help victims and crack down on this sickening crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Victims of modern slavery are often incredibly vulnerable and face cultural, social, economic and language barriers. There have also been significant gaps in the support services we provide for victims of modern slavery. A commissioner would assist to remedy these gaps in enforcement, help victims and work with civil society to help prevent and detect slavery in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was reported earlier this year, Australia is not alone in proposing such laws. Business reporting on human rights is a growing trend, with a large number of jurisdictions having introduced reporting or due diligence requirements in recent years. Some Australian companies already report under the UK act. In addition, comparable laws have been introduced across the European Union and in some states and sectors in the United States. Denmark has laws requiring corporate social responsibility reporting, and in Brazil there is a 'dirty list' enabling public shaming of businesses using forced labour. In 2017 the French parliament introduced a new due diligence law on Human Rights and the environment for businesses. Other European countries are also in the process of developing comparable laws, such as the Netherlands' child labour due diligence laws, and I believe Australia must and should follow suit. Before us today we have that opportunity to do so and play a lead role in eradicating modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the minister said in his second reading speech on this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2018 is a landmark year in terms of tackling modern slavery within Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have a moral imperative to eradicate this practice from our supply chains and our businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to those opposite that we have an opportunity to do just that, just as the minister said in his second reading speech. If we support the amendments in this bill moved by Labor and get serious about eradicating modern slavery, we can get this done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, tonight I do want to acknowledge the bipartisan nature of the way that this issue has been handled, even though we have moved amendments tonight. In particular, on this side of the chamber I acknowledge the dedication and hard work of our shadow justice minister, the member for Hotham, but also the work of Senator Lisa Singh and Senator Louise Pratt, who have been at the forefront, championing this issue and making sure that it is in the public arena and that those people who are trapped in slavery in Australia and across the world do have a voice and do have an opportunity to be freed from the situation they're in. That is the hard work of many members on this side of the chamber but also across the government as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the offer of bipartisanship on this stands, we must work together to strengthen the penalties against modern slavery and to ensure that there is adequate oversight against this cruel measure to make it end once and for all.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  Slavery isn't something that most Australians associate with the 21st century. They have those images from what they've read and from what they've heard. There are really powerful songs that we're all familiar with, and there is what we've seen on television or at the movies. It is something very much associated with the past, with hundreds of years ago. There is that sense that, in a way, it is a thing of the past and not a modern phenomenon, but the extent of human trafficking, of slavery, of forced labour, of child labour, of the removal of organs and of other slavery-like practises in our region and within our borders is appalling. It is happening right now here in Australia, in our region and in Canberra in 2018. It is very much hidden in plain sight, as my colleague mentioned today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The numbers are horrifying. There are reportedly 48.5 million people in slavery worldwide, many of whom are victims of exploitation in private sector activities like manufacturing, like construction and like agriculture. As we've heard from this side throughout the course of this debate tonight and this afternoon, about two-thirds of people trapped in slavery are reported to be in our own region, in the Asia-Pacific region, in 2018. Many of these people are stuck in the global supply chain of products and services that Australians use each and every day. Victims of exploitation are in private sector activities like manufacturing, construction and agriculture—as I said, in the supply chain of products that either create what we use every day or are used every day. It is estimated that thousands of people are currently trapped in slavery right here in Australia. Those current estimates place around 4,300 people in slavery or slavery-like conditions here in Australia, which is simply horrific in a nation such as ours in the 21st century.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's particularly distressing that it is happening here in Canberra, in our nation's capital, as I speak. Just recently—in fact, in the last few months—we heard about police raids here in the ACT where women were discovered having been trafficked into the country from Thailand to forcibly work in the ACT sex industry. One woman claimed she was subject to a $50,000 debt, while others were working illegally on tourist visas. This case is still ongoing and before the courts. We've heard about the Filipino workers who were exploited at local massage parlours, forced to work long hours, underpaid, discriminated against and allegedly threatened that their families back home in the Philippines would be killed if they complained to anyone. Imagine the lives that those Filipino workers were living, being exploited in terms of working long hours and being underpaid and discriminated against. Imagine the fear they were living in each and every day about the fact that their family members were going to be killed should they speak out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That people engage in this activity just outrages me so much. I find I am speechless. I just cannot believe that one individual, individuals, consortia or gangs could actually do this to other human beings—exploit someone and instil that fear in someone. I find it absolutely appalling. I find it horrifying that it is actually happening here in the ACT today, as I speak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these workers worked 12 hours a day, six days a week, and were paid for only 38 hours per week. They were brought into Australia on 457 visas with the promise of an annual salary of $52,000. Some had their pay docked by $800 per fortnight over a nine-month period because the massage parlour owner deemed the shop was not getting enough income and not getting enough customers. Last year, thanks to the involvement of the AFP and the Fair Work Ombudsman, the workers were each back paid a fraction of what they were owed. Some of these workers are still owed individual amounts ranging from $92,000 to $125,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what about the employers? Deputy Speaker, do you know what they did to avoid all this liability? Those dirty dogs—that's the only term that you can use for the employers exploiting these people so appallingly—actually put the company into voluntary administration. That means that these workers who were being exploited, who were living with fear each and every day that their families were going to be killed, are unlikely to receive everything that they are owed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the 20 or so domestic workers who were kept in slavery-like conditions in embassies here in Canberra. They were being forced to work 12- to 18-hour days for a fraction of the minimum wage, with no weekends off, no holidays and no time off in lieu of overtime. They were forbidden to leave the premises. Again, they were locked away, living in fear, and being exploited in the process. While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requires all domestic staff in diplomatic residences to hold onto their passports at all times, some of the workers had theirs taken away. The then foreign minister said in a statement that her department 'treats allegations of mistreatment of domestic workers by foreign diplomats very seriously and are a matter for the police'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the issue here is the issue of diplomatic immunity. Australian authorities, when there is diplomatic immunity, are powerless to act. I know from having been a diplomat that the requirement is that, when you go and live in someone else's country, yes, there is diplomatic immunity, but you live by the laws. You abide by the laws and you respect the laws of the country in which you are living. So there is a kind of agreement that that's how you go about it if you are being decent. The fact that people are hiding behind diplomatic immunity and making it very difficult for Australian authorities to address these issues of incidents of exploitation and fearmongering is absolutely appalling. If we can't address this through legal means, what political or values based pressure can or should we bring to bear?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard a few weeks ago about the chef working 12-hour shifts in a restaurant six days a week. He had not only been working in those appalling conditions but had also been asked by his boss to pay the boss's tax bill. When I was in Melbourne when I heard this story, I was in a taxi and heading into a conference. The story came up on the radio, and the taxi driver turned to me and said, 'This is an issue that is far more widespread than people are talking about.' He said, 'I know of many instances of this happening.' The fact that this person was getting so badly exploited with 12-hour days six days a week, being underpaid and then being asked to pay the boss's tax bill was not news to the driver. Again, what human being does that to another human being? It's just breathtaking this is actually happening in Australia and we have got these incidents in Canberra in this day and age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Already we have ratified a number of international legal instruments to combat this exploitation—as we should, because slavery is one of the most heinous human rights abuses possible. We've ratified the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery; the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention. As a country and as a parliament, we must do more to prevent this practice. We must be ever-vigilant, and an effective, strong modern slavery act is a key part of that battle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August this year, along with another 65 of my colleagues, I met with representatives from the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans to discuss aspects and recommendations of this bill. We talked about what the face of modern slavery looks like: sex trafficking, child sex trafficking, forced labour, bonded labour or debt bondage, domestic servitude, unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers. We talked about the issue of forced marriage. There have been 173 referrals of forced marriage to the AFP, with the number growing steadily since 2013. The 2018 <span style="font-style:italic;">Trafficking in persons report: June 2018</span> from the Department of State in the United States highlights the actions signatory countries are taking to address modern slavery. Australia is a signatory, but there are still 18 countries that haven't become part of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. The protocol supplements the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. That's 18 countries, and within our own region there are at least six countries that haven't signed up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2018 <span style="font-style:italic;">Trafficking in </span><span style="font-style:italic;">persons</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> report</span>, Australia's own country narrative shows we are committed to addressing modern slavery, but it also shows us where we can focus our attention in the future. According to the report, in 2017 we investigated 166 suspected cases of trafficking; prosecuted six defendants; convicted five traffickers, one sex trafficker and four labour traffickers; and investigated one case of domestic slavery in a diplomatic household but were unable to prosecute due to the diplomatic immunity I mentioned before. We prosecuted four defendants for allegedly travelling overseas for child sex tourism, but no convictions were reported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the observations made in the report about Australia's legal framework was the apparent preference to pursue labour and employment charges over trafficking charges. It was noted that the labour and employment charges attract a lesser sentence or penalty than trafficking charges. It is hoped the introduction of the framework outlined in this bill will help address this. It is important to remember that we have come a long way and it has taken some time for us to get to this point where we are even looking at legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a Labor government back in 2013 that first recognised the need to consider the risks of slavery-like conditions in Australian supply chains and noted the actions that other countries where taking or were going to undertake in response. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended the government undertake a review to establish antitrafficking and antislavery mechanisms, including legislation to improve transparency and supply chains, increasing the prominence of fair trade, and the development of a labelling and certification strategy for products and services produced ethically. Noting the hard work and the involvement of non-government organisations in vulnerable communities where slavery-like conditions are able to be identified, the committee also recommended that contracts for these NGOs be refunded one year ahead of the current contract's conclusion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from my conversations with ACRATH that there is some concern about funding certainty from many NGOs working in this area. The current 12-month funding cycle is competitive, meaning many organisations are competing against each other for funding rather than working in a cooperative and collaborative way, the approach that is needed for their work on crime prevention and advocacy and support of trafficked persons. ACRATH has sought a three- to five-year funding cycle from the Department of Home Affairs budget as part of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Slavery. I will be watching this space carefully to see what steps the government takes to move this plan forward in collaboration with the people working on the ground—that is, the NGOs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One year ago, Labor committed to a modern slavery act with penalties and an independent antislavery commissioner. That's how seriously Labor takes this issue; we put the role of an independent antislavery commissioner front and centre of our act. The commissioner would work with victims of slavery, receive inquiries and complaints and assist business in building best practices that protect their supply chains. The commissioner would also work with civil society to help detect and prevent slavery in Australia, as well as lead our global efforts to fight slavery, including working with other countries and international organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor sought to work in a bipartisan way on this issue to develop this legislation, so you can imagine our frustration and disappointment with the current bill. It is without penalties, and evidence provided to the Senate inquiry into this bill showed that in the UK, where there are no penalties, the percentage of businesses that are reported still hovers at around 30 per cent of those that supposedly have an obligation to report. That is just not good enough. The absence of penalties in this bill is baffling. We cannot leave it to these absolutely dirty dogs to police themselves on slavery. We cannot leave it to them. Key stakeholders, including ACRATH, Anti-Slavery Australia and the ACTU have joined Labor in the call for the establishment of an independent antislavery commissioner, and we will be fighting to ensure that Australia gets a slavery act that will actually make a difference.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I would like to commend this bill to the House. Slavery has, of course, been a persistent evil throughout human history and, as we know, it remains; there are still 25 million victims of modern slavery who are exploited in global supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My first contact with people who were slavery victims was actually on 24 December 2014. I was deployed with the Australian Defence Force to a Middle Eastern country and some of my colleagues and I ended up at a Christmas Eve service. We came into contact with some women working at a women's refuge which was helping to get women who had been the victims of slavery back to their home country. I don't want to go into too much detail because I think that refuge continues to operate and continues to look after women from a certain country, but women were coming to that country and finding work, then they would have their passports stripped from them and then they would be forced into sex slavery. The refuge where these women could flee to was established, and then, through their home country, they would be recovered and reunited with their families. It really did emphasise that slavery is a problem, and that's why I'm so heartened that this government is taking action to make sure that Australian businesses have no place for slavery and to ensure that we have transparency in our supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The central objective of the bill is to combat modern slavery in the supply chains of our goods and services. As I said, the UN estimates that up to 25 million modern slavery victims are exploited in global supply chains. The government has worked very hard, through a range of consultations with stakeholders, on the key features of the bill to ensure that the bill is practical to implement for business and is consistent with community expectations. Under the reporting requirement, for example, over 3,000 corporations, trusts, partnerships and other entities will need to publish annual modern slavery statements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will set a $100 million threshold for reporting. This ensures that it focuses on entities that have the capacity to meaningfully comply and the market influence to clean up global supply chains. Statements will need to address mandatory criteria set out in the bill, including identifying the entity's key modern slavery risks and describing its actions to address these risks. These criteria will provide certainty for business about how to report and will ensure statements can be easily compared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't go on because many have spoken on this bill already. I just wanted to lend my voice to it, and also to commend my colleague the member for Dunkley, who's done a lot of hard work in getting the bill to this point. I acknowledge the support we've received from those opposite, although we disagree on key features of the bill. This bill is a really important historic step by Australia in its fight against modern slavery. It's sensible, it's practical and perhaps over time we can enhance it once we get a sense of how the incentives embedded in the bill work to eradicate slavery from goods and services in our supply chains.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I support the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. More particularly, I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for justice, the member for Hotham. Clearly, there's broad support for this bill because we want a legislative framework in place to combat the scourge of modern slavery. I particularly support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for justice because it adds some sensible, constructive changes that will ensure that this bill and its framework will implement stronger and more effective action. It's the sort of thing that I'd like to think the government would consider. I'll come to the detail of some of that in a moment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme of what I have to say is almost in the vein of 'so close and yet so far'. It's great that we've finally reached this point, but it's a shame that there are some very significant shortcomings. Labor has pushed for action to combat modern slavery for some time. It was more than a year ago that we committed to a modern slavery act. It's good that the government has seen fit to follow along, although not in the way that it could if it were really serious about getting some sort of change, both within Australia and other countries that Australian companies use for the purposes of their supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As others have said, the government's bill imposes a reporting requirement on entities with consolidated revenue of more than $100 million. It includes an obligation to make public on an annual basis action taken to address modern slavery risks by companies in their operations and supply chains. It also creates a modern slavery business engagement unit within the Department of Home Affairs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill follows in the wake, to some degree, of the commitment that Labor made. More particularly, it follows from the inquiry undertaken by the Foreign Affairs and Aid Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Like the member for Canning, I recognise that work. The report of the inquiry was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in plain sight</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n inquiry into establishing a Modern Slavery Act in</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span>. I congratulate the chair, the member for Dunkley, and the deputy chair, the member for Wakefield.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth thinking carefully and closely about what addressing modern slavery really means. 'Modern slavery' describes circumstances in which a person is compelled to work through some kind of coercion or is trafficked for work and in other ways exploited for their labour. It describes circumstances in which a person is inevitably deprived of their liberty, deprived of their basic human rights and often—I would say in many cases—subjected to abuse, mistreatment, violence, danger and of course the denial of proper wages and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's estimated that modern slavery could be the circumstances that face somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 people in Australia. Worldwide, it affects more than 40 million—some estimate close to 50 million. It is sobering to think that more people are trapped in slavery today than there have been at any other time in human history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not hard to imagine the kinds of people who are typically prey to those who practise and profit from modern slavery. They're people who are vulnerable. They're people who are subject to coercion and can be threatened, who can be motivated by the application of force or some other kind of advantage. Children, women, migrants, refugees, people in seasonal work, people in regional and remote areas, seafarers—these are the kinds of people who are at risk of experiencing modern slavery. People in countries without effective governance and regulation, people in countries without strong unions and other civil society organisations—these are the kinds of people who are at risk of being victims of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all those reasons, our response has to look well beyond our own shores. As I said, it may be 5,000 to 10,000 people here; it's more than 40 million people elsewhere. That's why there needs to be an appropriate obligation on Australian companies to interrogate and be vigilant about the reality of the work practice in their supply chains. I note one of the comments from the Human Rights Law Centre in relation to the parliamentary inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've heard horrific stories of abuse linked to some of Australia's biggest brands. Burmese migrants chained … to Thai fishing boats supplying the seafood we eat. Australian surf wear made in North Korean sweatshops.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are just two examples of the way in which Australian companies can unwittingly be involved in and effectively support practices that constitute modern slavery. It picks up the title of the committee inquiry report, which was <span style="font-style:italic;">Hidden in plain sight</span>. I think very few Australians as they go about their lives, when they get dressed and put on a T-shirt that's made in Thailand or open a can of tuna that is sourced from somewhere else, would think that, inherent in that aspect of their daily life, is quite extraordinary suffering of someone else; that, in order for them to get the tuna at the price they get it or the unbelievably cheap cotton T-shirt, the value is extracted from another human being, a value in terms of their labour and worse—that their liberty is infringed upon; that they suffer in all of the kinds of ways that humans can bring other humans to suffer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do need to recognise that, as the world becomes more globally interlinked and companies seek to make extended supply chains part of how they are competitive and successful in our country, the push to be competitive and efficient and to take advantage of those kinds of global opportunities does come with an inherent risk. If, as an Australian company, you come to know of an opportunity that is attractive to you because the labour costs involved seem to be too good to be true, or part of your product or enterprise relies on a good or a service that is labour-intensive and the price of that good or service seems too good to be true, it probably is. It probably is too good to be true, in the sense that it may well rely on the kinds of practices that we regard as modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just make a side observation, separate to this bill. I think if we are serious about modern slavery, we have to go well beyond the reporting requirements that this bill places on Australian companies—and the extent to which they actually place those on Australian companies is something I'll come back to—and look at things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, as a modern trade and investment agreement, does include some labour standards and environmental standards—but they are weak. They are standards that are not capable of being enforced. There are mechanisms within those agreements that provide oversight, transparency and compliance but the consequences for noncompliance are non-existent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to think about the fact that Australia doesn't presently have a debarment policy that operates at the national level. It's not just private companies that are involved in contracting with foreign companies and having access to sort of foreign labour. Australian governments typically do that through their procurement and other contracting arrangements, yet we don't have in place the debarment architecture that would mean that, where a company or an operation overseas has been found to engage in exploitive practices or modern slavery, they would be prevented from being involved in Australian procurement processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having talked about the way modern slavery occurs overseas and the way Australian companies are at risk of being complicit in that kind of conduct, we shouldn't think it doesn't happen in Australia—it does. There have been some examples in my home state of Western Australia. It was not that long ago that we had a live export ship, known as <span style="font-style:italic;">Bader III</span>, where, in addition to the mistreatment of animals that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bader III</span> delivered, it also involved the mistreatment of humans. It involved the mistreatment of its crew, who hadn't been paid for six months, who weren't allowed to go ashore, who were owed, in sum, about half a million dollars, and who had been forced to sign contracts under which, if they were injured or ill, they would pay for their own repatriation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also agricultural operations in Carabooda and Pemberton in Western Australia that came to the attention of authorities and seemed to constitute a practice of modern slavery in the agricultural setting. When you looked at the Fair Work Commission's assessment of those circumstances, it was interesting to note the elements that they identified that made the employment of the people involved akin to modern slavery. They were migrant workers; their movements were controlled; their basic liberty was compromised; they lived under the threat of further jeopardy; they lived in substandard conditions; and they were required to work for unacceptable pay in unacceptable conditions. That is essentially the definition of modern slavery, and it was happening in Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning, it's a bit of a case of so close and yet so far. It's disappointing that this bill and the mechanism or the structure it puts in place doesn't apply any penalties for a failure to comply. I think it's pretty obvious to people out there in the community that, if you put in place a requirement and you say that people have an obligation to report and they do not comply and nothing happens, there's a big question mark over exactly how effective that would be. This bill does not create or fund an independent anti-slavery commissioner. Instead, it has this sort of unit within the Department of Home Affairs. It seems that that unit will focus on helping businesses to undertake their compliance work. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I'm not saying that assistance shouldn't be provided. But an independent antislavery commissioner would ensure that there would be some focus on victims, that there would be some perhaps investigative capacity or at least the capacity to work with and advise other kinds of law enforcement bodies. It's not as if that's just something that the opposition and the shadow minister for justice had been calling for; that's the unanimous recommendation of the foreign affairs subcommittee, which had, as its recommendation No. 6, the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner precisely to 'ensure victims of modern slavery, including children, have access to appropriate support services', and also under a separate bullet point 'to work with various agencies, law enforcement bodies, prosecutors and others to increase the identification and reporting of modern slavery crimes and to bolster the prosecution rates for modern slavery offences'. That won't occur because there is no independent antislavery commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the bill in some respects takes the UK's Modern Slavery Act, which was introduced in 2015, as something of a model but, again, it doesn't really follow that closely enough. One of the best examples is in the threshold that's been set for Australian companies. At $100 million, it's considerably higher than the threshold in the UK. The committee, again, unanimously recommended a $50 million threshold. Civil society organisations suggested the threshold be the same as ASIC's definition of a large corporation, which would be $25 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, it's a welcome step forward; we support it. We particularly support the amendment, which would make it even better. It's a shame we've come so far and yet fall short. If we are going to do these things—they are important regulatory steps—why not get them right? Why not follow the process? You task a committee with doing it, it's led by a member of the government, it produces a unanimous report that follows international best practice and civil society advice, and yet we don't take it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  There are two key components, I believe, in this bill, and two key purposes, I believe, in this bill introducing a modern slavery act here in Australia. The first is that it will say that, here in this country, we will require companies to look at their supply chain. As previous speakers have said, that's the international supply chain. That means requiring companies who import goods into our country, whether they be used in manufacturing or whether they go straight to sales, to look to see if there is modern slavery occurring in their supply chain. As others have said, it is critical that Australia be involved and take this lead given that two-thirds of the victims, it's estimated, are in our region of South-East Asia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all seen the modern slavery horror stories. We have all heard of the horror stories when they have been exposed via the media. And we do only have estimates because it is hard to quantify unless we actually start requiring multinationals, large companies, to start to do this work. So that's the first important part of this bill. As a country, Australia will join countries like the UK and say: if you wish to do business in Australia then we want to know that your business is doing everything it can to stop acts of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other key part to this bill makes us look at ourselves as a country and ask: are we doing all we can to stop modern slavery in our own country? One estimate is that there's roughly 4,300 victims of modern slavery today in Australia. Other estimates have it as high as 15,000. And it's quite confronting, I think, for some Australians to learn that we have victims of slavery in our country, because many thought that this was dealt with centuries ago. But it wasn't. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have one example of modern slavery here in our country that I wish to raise. The industries that are most at risk are well established. We've spoken about what's going on in agriculture, in our hospitality industry, in beauty and massage services, in construction and in other areas of our economy. A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet with some farm workers. The member for Blair and the member for Hotham were there. One young woman told us her story. She's Indonesian and she first entered the country on a tourist visa. She was coming here to study. She'd received some bad advice from the agency who'd recruited her. She had entered the country and was immediately put on a minivan with blacked-out windows. She was basically driven from Melbourne Airport to rural New South Wales, where she was dropped off at a caravan park and stayed in shared accommodation that was quite substandard with about 10 men whom she'd never met before. She was then forced to pick fruit for long hours of the day and was paid very little, if anything. She was told she had a debt that she had to pay back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She was completely scared, completely isolated. This could be an example of modern slavery. She was scared to speak up because she knew that what was happening was wrong. She was scared to speak to police because she wasn't sure, first of all, how to access them or whom to speak to. And she was very scared by what her employer, if you can call them that, was saying. She feared for her family back home, she feared being deported and she also feared the debt that was hanging over her head. Fast-forward five years and she's now seeking help through the NUW about her circumstance and about how to go forward. But, if we had some sort of amnesty for this particular work, then we might be able to start to go down the path of prosecution for her experience. Unfortunately, this particular worker is not alone. When she spoke to us, there were, in fact, eight other workers in similar situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not saying that all cases of worker exploitation are cases of modern slavery. There is a degree of worker exploitation in our country that is unprecedented, that we have never seen before. Some of those really extreme cases could be cases for modern slavery, hence the reason for this bill to come before us so we can start exposing that. It is also about the importance of penalties and the importance of having an independent antislavery commissioner established here in this country so that they can make recommendations on how to prosecute and how to toughen up the laws to crack down on this behaviour. That is one of the reasons why the amendments that Labor has put forward should really be considered by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill doesn't have penalties. This bill should include strong enforcement mechanisms imposing penalties on companies that do not comply with the act. A failure to include penalties in the bill renders the reporting requirement optional. We know that the worst offenders won't report if it is optional. We know that because that's how corporates behave. Companies like McDonald's have already proudly said: 'We've already done this. We're already doing this.' They have actually met several MPs to say, 'This is what we're doing.' Part of what triggered it for them as a multinational corporation is the UK's version of the modern slavery act. So there are some companies in our country that are already acting, but they've taken that first step. It's the ones that don't do it that are the problem, and that's why there need to be penalties: to ensure we force the companies that don't actually report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for the independent antislavery commissioner is to assist with compliance to ensure that the bill has a unit that works within the department. It's also to help suggest how we can continue to strengthen and prosecute throughout the supply chain to ensure that we are doing our bit to crack down on modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time I drive past one of those massage parlours, in an old converted house with the neon signs, I do fear for the women who could be working in there. We know from faith based organisations who reach out to these women that there are cases that could constitute modern slavery—women who are locked into these massage parlours, having their passports taken, being forced to work long hours and, in some cases, being forced to work as sex workers. Prosecutions in this space have been low, because of the fear and the intimidation. That is why we need to do more. We need to do more to crack down on modern slavery in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just in that sector or in agriculture that we're seeing it. We're also starting to see gross examples of worker exploitation in the construction industry. As we stand here today, there are over 100 guest workers or temporary workers who've come here from China that are working as plasterers in Hobart at the Hobart Hospital site who haven't been paid. They haven't been paid for nine weeks now. At a very basic level you would say that that is a case of underpayment; it is a case of worker exploitation. Yes, it is, and it needs to be resolved. However, once you start that prosecution and start exploring and unpacking what has happened, you may find that their passports have been taken. You may find that they have a bonded debt that they have to pay back to the agency or the company that's recruited them. You may find that there are threats against their family back home in their country of origin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fair Work has a critical role to play in this, in that that could be the entry point where people first start to seek help. We know this because it's appeared in a number of reports that the Fair Work Ombudsman has released into the treatment of temporary workers, people who are here on visa arrangements. That's why I think that what the government are trying to do is a bit tokenistic. It's about saying, 'Yes, we want to tick the box to say that we are doing something about modern slavery.' But in some ways what they have put forward is bit of window-dressing—it's optional whether you comply. It also doesn't have enough steps in place to act on that very good step of saying, 'We are taking modern slavery seriously,' by building the links back to where someone might be a victim of modern slavery but they have entered through, say, an underpayment case or through the Migrant Workers Centre which has just opened up in Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others in this place have spoken about cases of domestic servants—people who have entered the country, maybe on a tourist visa, who are now working as domestic servants. There have been cases in Melbourne and Canberra where they have actually said that they could constitute a form of modern slavery—passports taken; not paid; underpaid; locked in and unable to leave the premises; and threats being made against their person or against family members. It is just unacceptable that that is happening here in Australia in plain sight. We know that it is a problem in the cleaning industry, the construction industry and the hotel industry—practically, wherever there are workers who are here on a temporary arrangement, they could be victims of modern slavery. The government needs to be doing more to support them where they have been underpaid and doing more to investigate and to ensure that we've got that practical support for people going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I held a modern slavery discussion forum in my electorate, in both Woodend and Kyneton, where the shadow minister, Clare O'Neil, and I discussed with the local community how it is our human rights obligation to start acting up and speaking up about this issue. We need to make sure that any bill that is put forward on this issue isn't just tokenistic, that we are genuinely trying to change and make a real effort towards cracking down on modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the forum, people asked several questions. At the forum, there was a bit of surprise at the statistics that at this point in time we have more people trapped in slave-like conditions than ever before in our modern history and that two-thirds of the people are in our region. They talked about how as consumers they want to be more aware—aware of the companies that are trying to crack down on modern slavery—so they can use their purchasing power to ensure that they, as good global citizens, are buying products and securing services from companies which are committed to cracking down on and ending the scourge of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An interesting sort of development with one of our multinational companies is that CUB, which is part of a global beer beverage company, has moved in a number of its workplaces here in Australia to start using Australian-made bottles, labels and cartons. Therefore there's an opportunity within this, when we ask major companies to look at their supply chain, for these companies to potentially say, 'Well, if I have to comply with the Modern Slavery Act and the work that's involved in that and the fact that it is quite hard to police what's happening in other countries—it can get complicated and it can get costly—maybe the cost-benefit analysis says that it's actually easier and more affordable to start using Australian based products.' That is something that could be also a positive outcome when we start to ask companies to ethically look at how they are procuring product, whether it be for sale in this country or to be used in further manufacturing.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  The Modern Slavery Bill 2018 is what I would describe as inadequate legislation that purports to respond to a very serious global problem. The previous speaker, the member for Bendigo—and I commend her remarks—referred to it as 'tokenistic' legislation, and I agree with her.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For millions of people around the world, human slavery didn't end in the early 19th century, despite William Wilberforce's commendable efforts and the British parliament, I think, in 1833 passing legislation outlawing slavery. It simply pushed slavery underground, screened by a veneer of conventions and laws that gave hope to those enslaved at the time and those who were fighting to have slavery stopped. In reality, it didn't end the slavery but simply changed the modus operandi of those who still use people as slaves to profit from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As other speakers on this side have also made clear—and it follows the comments about it being inadequate legislation or tokenistic legislation—we only have the legislation before us because of the efforts of those on this side of the House, who have continued to raise this issue, as have so many other groups in society. Indeed, I can recall, as a member of the joint standing committee that looked into procurement, in our discussions and in listening to witnesses who appeared before that committee, stressing the point that one of the first things the government itself should do as part of its procurement obligations is ensure that any government procurement did not come from a place where slavery of any kind or indeed any kind of worker exploitation had been used at the time. So it's an issue that's been before this parliament for some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I say that the legislation is inadequate, at least the legislation is a step in the right direction. More importantly, it actually acknowledges that there is a real problem out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others have talked about figures of somewhere between 40 and 50 million people around the world being enslaved today. I've seen figures that go up to perhaps 70 million. The truth of the matter is that we don't know how many people are enslaved in the world today, because those people who operate this way are not likely to report the number of people that they have working for them and whom they are exploiting. But, regardless of what the figures are, we do know that the figures are quite revealing. Indeed, as others have made clear, there are more people in slavery today than at any other time before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're aware from reports that we've had from within this country and from overseas that people are working in mines, brick kilns, garment factories, farms, shipping boats, brothels and other places as slaves. What's even more concerning is that in some cases they are working from within their own homes. We've heard of terms like bonded slavery, forced migrant labour, sex slavery or even early forced marriages, child labour and so on. These are terms that arise again because there is an acknowledgement that the problem exists, but it's always dealt with in a very simplistic way where we might deal with one particular problem over here and another over there. It's never been looked at as the problem that it really is, and that is a problem of people working as slaves right around the world. Their work and their exploitation is taking place not only from those who have got them under their control but from everyone else who deals with those firms and people that abuse slaves to make a profit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other concerns—and I'll be speaking about this when we come back next week—is the concern I have about people who are in slave camps today under oppressive governments that imprison people because they are dissidents to the regime and then use them from within those camps as slave labour to manufacture products and goods for their state. But I'll have a bit more to say about that next week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also the case that, as inequality across the world widens, including here in Australia, more and more people are enslaved by extreme poverty and shackled not by chains but by their needs and their commitment to their families. They work as slaves in order to ensure a living for themselves and the people who depend on them. As others have also said, they become vulnerable to heartless employers who exploit them in way that I personally cannot understand. I cannot understand how one person is willing to profit from the harm they do to another in the way that we know is occurring perhaps in Australia and certainly in other parts of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, what is also of concern is that governments in so-called respectable countries, including our own, have not only looked the other way when we know this is possibly happening but have at times, through deregulation policies such as the shipping legislation this government brought in this parliament only a few weeks ago, enabled those people who want to exploit others to do so and to do so much more easily. The member for Fremantle talked about those people on the ships that take away our live animals. I've no doubt that they are exploited, if not enslaved. But I'm aware of others who work in the shipping industry who are treated equally badly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the minister's second reading speech, I picked several phrases which I'm going to quote because, quite frankly, they highlight why this is inadequate legislation and why this legislation will not address the issue as it could have. The minister said, 'This legislation will shine a light.' He went on to say: 'It will require large business to be transparent to address modern slavery by establishing a flexible, risk based reporting framework. It will transform the way the Australian business community responds to modern slavery. It will create a level playing field, and businesses that fail to take action will be penalised by the market and consumers and severely tarnish their reputations.' What nonsense! Who out of the people who are currently exploiting their labour or enslaving people would do so if they had any conscience at all? If they have any conscience at all, are they going to declare what they are doing to the government every time the government asks them to annually prepare their reports? Of course they won't. It is the very people who are allowing this to happen who are the ones who are the most likely to have the lowest standards of morality and who will be the people who are not law abiding. If we're asking them to effectively turn themselves in and tell you what they are doing, it's not going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the matter is that right now people around this country are buying products from businesses that bring them in from countries where they know that the products have been made by slave labour. Again, even consumers are prepared to say: 'I'm not responsible for where the product comes from. I will buy what I can afford.' So it happens, and it happens under our very eyes. The fact that the government will publish an annual modern slavery statement is not going to resolve this problem, because the statement will rely on the information provided to it by the businesses that are expected to report, and those businesses are not going to declare anything that will harm their reputation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government wants industries to comply, then the truth of the matter is that we need several other aspects to this legislation, which members of this side of the House have talked about. Firstly, there needs to be real penalties in place, and the government needs to set up an agency that is able to monitor the situation and carry out its own investigations should any reports of exploitation or slavery arise. If you have those two things together, it will mean that businesses will comply, because it is not up to them to simply report—there is another authority that's being established to ensure that they comply. If they don't, then they will be penalised accordingly, and the penalties should be severe enough to prevent exploitation taking place in the first instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also have some sort of independent authority, whether it's a commissioner or something of a similar nature, to ensure that the intent of this legislation is carried out. That person or that department should not only have the ability to ensure that the legislation or the intent of it is carried out and that the bad practices are stopped but also be a person or a department with real authority—the authority to go in, the authority to audit and inspect books if need be, and the authority to make the relevant inquiries and get the information that it needs in order to, again, ascertain whether there has been any exploitation taking place of any kind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last matter that concerns me about this legislation as it currently stands is that it only applies to businesses with a turnover of $100 million or more. My view is that that figure is too high, and my view is that there are many, many businesses in Australia today that already deal with overseas companies who in turn make products by using slave labour. Those companies will be left out of the net that this legislation hopes to capture. I suspect that there is as much of the slavery products resold through those companies as there is through the companies that have got a $100 million or more turnover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this legislation will not address the issue adequately. It could easily be fixed by reducing the dollar amount of companies' turnover that requires them to report annually. It could be fixed by having an independent commissioner of some sort. It could be fixed by having much higher penalties. These are matters that I would hope the government—whether it's this government or a future government—would look at, because the reality is that, rather than reducing the number of people around the world that are being treated as slaves today, we're going backwards and the figures are rising with each and every report that is prepared.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I rise to speak on the Modern Slavery Bill 2018. I say up-front that I wholeheartedly welcome the introduction of a modern slavery bill into this parliament. I had the idea of bringing in this legislation with some contacts put to me by a former senator from Western Australia, Chris Evans, in London a few years ago, the idea being that we copy the UK model. We have taken aspects of the United Kingdom's legislation—sadly, not all of it. It's long past time that our laws addressed the horrific reality of modern slavery and slavery-like practices. People don't need to have an image of some slave ships with manacles; there are now sweatshops and workshops where people are in slave-like conditions. Sadly, we have people enduring slavery-like practices even in our own suburbs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor announced its policy to address this scourge last year. It was a policy formed after extensive consultation with stakeholders, as all good policies should be. Labor's policy received support from business, civil society and the union movement. When you have the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU and the Salvation Army all coming together to say that this is good legislation and that they're supportive of it, you know that you're consulting with stakeholders appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wants to see an end to modern slavery, so it has called on the government to match its commitment. After pressure from all corners—Labor, parliamentary committees and stakeholders—the government has finally introduced this bill. But don't be fooled; unfortunately, this is not exactly the same policy put forward by the Shorten-led Australian Labor Party. Sadly, this is a much watered down version. Labor's proposed modern slavery act included transparency and supply chain mechanisms, which, importantly, contained penalties for non-compliance. Labor's policy also proposed the creation of an independent antislavery commissioner, much like the commissioner in the United Kingdom. It is disappointing that the Morrison-McCormack government has stopped short of Labor's proposal, although it is not surprising that the Morrison-McCormack government is not prepared to be tough on big business. Labor will be moving amendments to this bill to make sure it is not a toothless tiger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm horrified that human trafficking, forced labour, sexual slavery, child labour and trafficking, domestic servitude, forced marriage, bonded labour—including debt bondage—and slavery are still being inflicted on our fellow human beings in the 21st century. But that is the reality. This piece of legislation is important in that it sends the message that we will not tolerate this anymore. It is drawing a line in the sand and saying 'no more' to this insidious practice of modern slavery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are estimated to be around 48.5 million people in slavery worldwide. Two-thirds of those trapped in slavery are in our own neighbourhood, in the Asia-Pacific region—an area where we are seen to be a beacon, a healthy democracy, as one of the five oldest democracies on the planet. We can be a role model by engaging with many of these countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, even on our shores here in Australia, there are estimated to be around 4,300 people who are trapped in slavery right now. Many of those are victims of exploitation in private sector activities, even in things like manufacturing, construction and agriculture—activities that we can support as Australian consumers. Some Australian companies, such as Fortescue Metals and Wesfarmers, have acknowledged that they have found forms of forced labour in their own company supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Products that we consume regularly are linked to this horrifying exploitation. One is chocolate. Australians consume three million tonnes of chocolate every year. We need to be very careful when it comes to consuming chocolate to make sure that the supply chains are appropriate, and that workers are appropriately remunerated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Melbourne's west is the fastest-growing region in Australia's fastest-growing city. This growth is reshaping our city, and we need Melbourne's infrastructure to evolve with it. The Andrews Labor government has made tremendous progress on this front, both by committing real government funding for critical infrastructure projects and by bringing a long-term vision to infrastructure planning in Victoria. It's finally broken ground on the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel—an absolutely crucial investment to expand rail capacity from the west. It's picked a route and started the process of building the Melbourne Airport rail link through the Sunshine-Albion corridor. It's done this despite a federal coalition government that has largely abandoned Victorian infrastructure investment. It's done this despite a coalition government that, upon coming to office, withdrew $3 billion in funding for the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel, delaying the single most important infrastructure project in Victoria by years and, after that, invested less than nine per cent in federal infrastructure funding in Victoria, despite the fact that Victoria represents around a quarter of the country's population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of this rapid population growth, inaction and delay on infrastructure investment can have long-term consequences. The need for long-term planning on infrastructure investment is particularly acute in Melbourne's west. The population of Melbourne's west has grown at twice the rate of the rest of Victoria during the last decade. Unsurprisingly, during this time, the rail lines serving Melbourne's west have seen the highest growth in rail patronage of any lines in the state. Passenger numbers on the Werribee, Williamstown and Sunbury lines—all running through my electorate—have increased by more than 100 per cent during the last decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Metro's 2016 strategic operational plan warned that the Werribee and Sunbury lines would be at capacity by 2019, underlying the costs of the federal coalition government's delay of the Melbourne Metro Tunnel. Major investments from the Andrews government in upgrades to power, track, stations and modern signalling along these lines will increase capacity in the short term. When it's completed, the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel will provide even more capacity, which is why it's such a relief that—thanks to the Andrews government's management of the project—it's on track to be completed a year early.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we need to be doing the long-term planning now to ensure that the next big investments in expanding rail capacity to these corridors of rapid population growth are well in train before we again reach the crush point. This is why it is important that detailed planning for Melbourne Metro 2 is happening now. Melbourne Metro 2 would create another Metro rail tunnel, connecting the Werribee line in Melbourne's west via a tunnel from Newport to Fishermans Bend and then on to Parkville and Clifton Hill, joining the Mernda-South Morang line in the north-east. Experts argue that Melbourne Metro 2 could quadruple passenger rail capacity for the Werribee line corridor, creating a vital new link to the city for the area's booming population. The Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel could also free up capacity on other lines in the inner west, allowing much needed higher service frequencies on the Altona and Williamstown lines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Victoria CEO Michel Masson has been calling for planning on the Melbourne Metro 2 tunnel to commence within 12 months, recently telling <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When it comes to additional capacity on public transport, there is absolutely no doubt that Melbourne Metro 2 has got a very important role to play.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Rail Futures Institute has argued the Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel should be built by 2030. Again, the Andrews Labor government has shown long-term thinking in making allowances for the Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel in its existing rail construction and planning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Public Transport, for the state of Victoria, in parliament last week underlined that the design and delivery of the current Metro tunnel project would allow for future expansion of the underground network, including Melbourne Metro 2. If we get to work on the difficult work of planning, surveying, soil testing and property acquisition for the Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel now, we could be in a position to start work on it immediately upon completion of the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel, utilising the Victorian government's investments in tunnel boring expertise, as well as the equipment used on the current project. Given this, it's important that detailed cost-benefit analysis of the Melbourne Metro 2 rail project is able to be undertaken in parallel with other major infrastructure investments planned in Victoria over the coming decade to ensure that infrastructure funding can be allocated where the returns to the public are greatest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Andrews government has a proud record on urban public transport infrastructure investment. It's done the hard yards in allocating real money for public transport infrastructure projects and on delivering them for the public. It's provided real leadership and vision in the long-term plan for public transport, infrastructure and investment in Melbourne. I look forward to the Melbourne Metro 2 rail tunnel being delivered by this visionary government in the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="18661" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BANKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Recently, the context of a moment of reflection struck me. It occurred in a quintessential Australian setting. I was walking along the beach, a girl skipped past me in the opposite direction and she was wearing a T-shirt which had emblazed on it 'Equality always wins'. In the business and political world, sometimes you have to take action against appalling behaviour. Appalling behaviour is an umbrella descriptor for bullying, intimidation, harassment—sexual or otherwise—or a lack of integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my political journey, a culture of appalling behaviour has been widespread, pervasive and undermining, like white ants. Sometimes the most effective and palatable action is to walk away. That's not the same as saying you are walking past the behaviour. Walking away is very powerful and there are many men, but particularly many women, in the workplace who've done this. Similarly, there are thousands who'd love to but can't afford to for a raft of reasons, including fear of reprisals or possible financial and career detriment. These are usually the same reasons that prevent women from calling out or from filing official reports of the behaviour. To all those women, this speech is for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My experience has taught me that the importance of having a job outside the political world cannot be underestimated. My husband and I, the dual working couple in the private sector with two young children and ageing parents, manage the juggles and joys of life in this our beautiful country as millions of Australian men and women do every day. There was a problem though in the business world—that was the lack of women in leadership positions. The business world addressed this issue years ago—I know; I was there. The political world is five to 10 years behind business in so many ways. The business world embraced this need for change in a multitude of ways but there's still a way to go. This included using targets. Targets work in business because they are tied to KPIs and incentives. Targets are a measure that work in business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reaction to my statement two weeks ago today stunned me for so many reasons. From across the political divide, there was both the groundswell of heart-warming support received from both in and outside this place to the reprisals and retribution—the old nothing to see here, no formal complaints, no evidence, name and shame et cetera cetera—and to the Labor Party bizarrely trying to argue their behaviour within their ranks is squeaky clean, as campaigned and role modelled by union thugs. Australians have bought none of it. In fact, this reaction has just made the support from Australian men and women even more emboldened. I'm reading all their emails, thank you. The support has come from Australians from all walks of life, men and women who want real change and who are fed up with the major parties treating such issues as either something they want to be swept under the carpet, to be managed as a media or crisis management optics issue, or for political point scoring as the Labor Party have attempted to do. How do we fix this? There is no panacea to fix this but a good start is to increase the representation of women in our parliament. This creates a level playing field. Only gender quotas will work in politics, not targets, because you cannot tie political office to salary or incentives as you can in business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that quotas are only resisted when they are related to gender. Quotas are not demeaning to women and nor will women will regarded as a 'quota girl'. The concept that this will begin that path to destruction of micro quotas depending on people's sexuality or ethnicity is ludicrous. We are talking about quotas for women, who represent more than half our population. The meritocracy argument is completely and utterly flawed. There are an equal number of meritorious women out there in the real world as there are men, but they won't come if the barriers to entry and mountains to climb are too high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liberalism embraces freedoms, individual enterprise, reward for effort, strong economic management and equal opportunity for all. Liberalism is underpinned by pragmatism and should move with change. Quotas would be a reset mechanism. They would create a level playing field. We already have a quota system with our coalition partners and we use the principle of quotas to ensure geographical state based distribution on the frontbench. An equal number of men and women should run for preselection. It's really simple. If you only have a man running and you can't find a woman, find one; they are out there. They represent half the population and so should a modern Liberal Party. Before that little girl on the beach is an adult, this parliament must be represented by a 50/50 split of men and women in both major parties, a parliament which truly represents the principle that equality always wins. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  Last month I attended the official opening of the Migrant Workers Centre at the Victorian Trades Hall in Carlton. The centre was established after continued calls from the migrant working community about their exploitation in the workforce. Migrant Workers Centre was established to assist and help migrant workers understand their employment rights and to empower them to enforce them. Migrant workers face language and cultural barriers and precarious employment arrangements, and they are incredibly vulnerable to unscrupulous employers. Some of the horrific conditions they have to face include employers stealing wages, unsafe working conditions, being forced to work long hours without a break, and threats, intimidation and bullying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that night, I got the opportunity to meet some of the workers and hear their stories. The disturbing accounts of exploitation by labour hire companies was an all-too-familiar story. One such worker, a cleaner, Olisa Heard, told of her experiences of poor treatment and intimidation by her employer. She spoke of no proper training for her in her role. Wage theft was a common occurrence for her and other migrant workers, who were treated differently from the other employees. Olisa was eventually fortunate, she says, to meet a union organiser from United Voice, who assisted and empowered her to speak out against her employer. Olisa soon discovered that she had rights and learnt to fight for them. She is now helping other migrant workers to do the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Andrews Labor government and Robin Scott, the Victorian Minister for Multiculturalism, for funding this much needed resource for migrant workers; Luke Hilakari, the secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall; and inaugural chair, George Lekakis, for initiating and supporting the Migrant Workers Centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate some amazing women in my electorate who have been recognised for their service to our local community. I want to congratulate Helena Gillies, the chair of Brite Services, who received a lifetime award at the Victorian Disability Awards for her unwavering support of people with disability. I have known Helena for close to 20 years and I am very familiar with the enormous contribution she has made to the community in the north-west of Melbourne, particularly in support of people with disabilities and their families. While Helena has devoted many volunteer hours and expertise to a range of community organisations within the fields of health, education, rehabilitation and employment, it is her more than 20 years of service to Brite Services and Brite Industries that stand out the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brite has become a well-known and highly regarded organisation within my electorate of Calwell, delivering a supported employment service and vocational training to people with disabilities. The remarkable success and growth of this enterprise is largely due to the passion and dedication of its volunteer board of directors over the years, and in particular to the drive and leadership of Helena Gillies. Another commendation for Brite Services went to its teaching staff, Patricia Niceforo, who received a 2018 Victorian Learn Local Awards for the continued work she has done since completing the introduction to catering courses at Brite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here in this chamber tonight, back in my home state of Melbourne and at Government House, Eugenia Pavlopoulou, senior journalist at <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span>, is accepting a Victorian multicultural commission award for excellence in the ethnic media from the Victorian Governor, an award I can proudly say I nominated her for. Representing a culturally diverse electorate, I know how pivotal ethnic media is and how important it is to my communities. Ethnic media informs and engages Australia's multicultural communities, who are vulnerable to isolation and disconnection because of a lack of education, a lack of English language, age and location. It provides a touch point to them to hear news from their homeland and to discuss mainstream Australian news in their mother tongue. It's a means to distributing important information about education, employment, health, social services, legal services and other services. It keeps them informed. Particularly for newer migrants and refugees, ethnic media assists in a smoother integration process.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For almost two decades, Eugenia Pavlopoulou has committed herself to Melbourne's Greek-speaking community, firstly as a radio journalist on 3AB in the early 2000s and now at <span style="font-style:italic;">Neos Kosmos</span>, where she has worked as editor, online editor and senior journalist for the last 16 years. As a bilingual journalist, she continues to produce important work that has increased awareness and understanding of multicultural affairs in Victoria and driven change in Melbourne's Greek-Australian community at a national level. I want to congratulate Eugenia for the work that she does. The award she receives tonight is highly deserved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Michael Gordon died in February of this year, competing as he loved to compete. The Melbourne Press Club has launched a national fellowship program for social justice journalism to honour the memory of Michael Gordon. Applications will open in October for the program of annual grants totalling as much as $30,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Michael, the much-loved and widely respected former political editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span>, died suddenly in an event. To encourage and enable the kind of journalism he exemplified, the Michael Gordon Fellowships will fund reporting projects in the field of social justice journalism in Australia and internationally, covering areas such as Indigenous affairs, migration policy, human rights and Third World development. The award will fund reporting projects in the field as envisaged: as much as $30,000 will be awarded to fund multiple reporting projects proposed by individuals and organisations, covering costs such as labour, travel and accommodation for those who receive the award.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foundation supporters of the program include the Copyright Agency's Cultural Fund, the National Press Club, Fairfax Media, the ABC, Sky News, Hawthorn Football Club and Grant Rule and Sophie Oh. The fellowships will be open to salaried and recognised freelance journalists working in all media across Australia and to accomplished university journalism students, covering the costs that I said before. They will be administered and promoted by the Melbourne Press Club and awarded by an independent panel appointed by the club and the Gordon family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Melbourne Press Club chief executive, Mark Baker, said that the club was proud to host a program that would enable important journalism at a time when journalists and media organisations are struggling with funding. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Michael was a fearless and compassionate journalist whose reporting on social justice issues made a real difference to our understanding in areas such as indigenous affairs and migration policy. We hope these fellowship grants will help continue some of that vital work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes someone steps out of your life as Michael stepped out of my life—and he's stepped out of the life of the parliament when he left <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> and was doing some work that would've been just an absolute pleasure for him in some freelance areas. I didn't know it at the time, but you've probably worked out that Michael and I were very close. He was as close a friend as I've had. There wasn't a week that went by in a year that we didn't speak—sometimes at length, sometimes over the projects he was working on and sometimes over just general issues of life, living and the transition that he was making from one area of his life to the next part. I've had this <span style="font-style:italic;">A question of leadership</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: Paul Keating, political fighter</span> by Michael Gordon in my office for a long time. He wrote a note in the front of it, which I won't read out because it's very personal. All of a sudden something becomes some treasured gift, something very special, that you never thought needed to be special.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm reminded that I'm probably not on my own. When people lose a neighbour or a loved one or a family member—the loss of a child from the parent's point of view must be just something incalculable in their grief, and the loss of a loved one, any loved one, a husband, a wife and even when your parents go—it's horrible. When someone's taken so early, when they had so much to give and so much to offer—we all have dreams that we want to do with our mates together. 'We're going to be doing this.' On the very morning that Michael was about to run in the event and then swim, we were driving down the street to go to breakfast at madcowes at Phillip Island. Here's Michael, walking along the footpath and, greasing full bore all these friends and mates that he meets at this competitions. Bron said, 'Pull over and talk to him.' I said: 'He'll be around at the house soon. I don't have to talk to him now.' I wouldn't want to interrupt one of the happiest moments of his life when he was walking amongst those competitors.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Michael Gordon Fellowships will be of great benefit to a whole lot of young people for a long time to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Last week the South Australian Marshall government delivered its first South Australian budget. It was delivered by the same Treasurer who delivered South Australian Liberal government budgets nearly two decades ago. For those of us who can remember those budgets, it was like groundhog day—the same Treasurer delivering a budget that cuts public service jobs, privatises public entities, shuts down government services, ultimately will result in the sale of public assets, and increases government charges that hurt the most vulnerable the most. As expected, the justification for the cuts and tough measures was that the state finances were left in a worse state than expected and the cuts were necessary. It's the usual spin and the same mantra conservative governments always use when they come to office as an excuse to implement their ideology of privatisation and outsourcing. More dishonestly, however, is that none of the cuts were flagged in the election campaign or during the years the Marshall government was in opposition. Is it any wonder that trust in politicians is lower than ever before or that, with its first budget, the Marshall government has managed to even further diminish that trust and has provoked hundreds of prison officers into a protest rally at Parliament House over the plan to privatise the Adelaide remand centre management?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is also clear from the Marshall government's budget is that the federal coalition has given up on South Australia in the next federal election, because this budget will not help their vote and, other than some rogue funding to sandbag a couple of coalition federal seats, I expect little other interest from their federal counterparts come the next federal election. We saw further evidence of that with revelations only today about Prime Minister Morrison's alleged comments about Tasmania, from which it is evident that the new Prime Minister has little time for the smaller states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget had some serious ramifications for residents of Adelaide's north-eastern and northern communities. Firstly, the Tea Tree Gully TAFE, adjacent to the Tea Tree Gully Plaza shopping centre, is to close. This closure comes at a time when public vocational training, through the damage caused by shonky training providers over recent years, needs to have public confidence restored in it—and there is no better way of doing that than by backing TAFE, not by tearing it down. Contrast the South Australian Liberal decision with that of federal Labor, which, if elected, has committed to rebuilding TAFE and providing 100,000 cost-free courses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the closure of Tea Tree Gully TAFE will inevitably cause the loss of local jobs that are directly or indirectly linked and supported by the TAFE campus. For local young people it will mean less accessible training opportunities, because travel to other TAFE campuses outside the region comes at a cost that not everyone can afford. Likewise, with the closure of the Modbury Service Centre, access to state government services will, for so many people, be made much more difficult and more costly. This is a busy service centre for which there is no defendable case for closure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In another blow, the Marshall government has deferred plans to increase the Park and Ride facility that is critical to the use of the O-Bahn Busway that links the north-east to the Adelaide CBD. In a particularly harsh measure, Housing SA tenants living in bedsits and one-bedroom cottage flats, many of whom are single pensioners already doing it tough, will be slugged with rent increases. Finally, if that were not enough, the Liberals are so driven by extreme ideology that they even want to privatise the Modbury Hospital patient transfers. This proposal was described by the Ambulance Employees Association as a significant drop in patient care. Clearly, this is a case of cutting costs at the expense of patient care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Marshall government's budget also highlighted that, in their first real public test, the newly elected Liberal members for the state electorates of Newland and King, Richard Harvey and Paula Luethen, have failed the people of the north-east as they stood by and watched the Marshall government cut these essential services to the local communities they represent. Not only have they let down their communities, but it's clear that the South Australian Liberals are not interested in the people living in the north and north-east of Adelaide. No other region of metropolitan Adelaide has been treated so shabbily by the Marshall government, and I've no doubt that the people of that region will remember that in future elections.</span>

                  <a href="230485" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  Around the country, there's a lot of focus on our farmers, and rightly so. Agriculture has been the central pillar of our economy. Much of Queensland and New South Wales in particular are in drought. While we've seen some rains, we need to see a whole lot more. Although my electorate is not drought declared, it has been extremely dry, particularly around the Burdekin, where sugar cane farmers are paying extraordinary power bills pumping water for irrigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any kind of farming is a tough job. Farmers are always at the mercy of the weather. They're often at the mercy of market prices, and, because 85 per cent of Queensland sugar is exported, cane farmers are at the mercy of world prices. They are sometimes at the mercy of government policies and even the policies of governments in other countries when they impact on subsidisation or foreign exports. Right now, for instance, sugar cane farmers in Australia are suffering because the world price is lower than the cost of harvesting. That comes about because other countries—India and Pakistan, for instance—have subsidised their farmers to overproduce and then dumped the excess sugar on the world market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers are also often at the mercy of a monopoly, as is the case in the sugar industry. Cane farmers must have a mill to send their sugar cane to in order for it to be milled, and normally there is only one mill that they can send it to. That gives milling companies, most of which in my electorate are owned by foreign multinationals, an unhealthy level of power when it comes to negotiation on matters such as price. The power that was wielded ruthlessly by Singaporean multinational Wilmar, when it announced in 2014 that it would sell all of its crushed sugar cane through its own marketing arm, was immense. Farmers feared, rightly, that the prospect of this multinational selling their sugar on the world market, when the company that owned the mill was itself the dominant player in the trading exercise, could mean lower prices for their crop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I raised those concerns with the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, he asked me to set up a sugar marketing task force. I was the chair of that task force, which conducted consultations extensively with farmers, milling companies and other stakeholders in the industry, and we made recommendations to the government, which included establishing a code of conduct for the sugar industry. The government then went about creating that code and set a date for its operation to be reviewed, with the view that, if it needed to continue, it could be enshrined in legislation. This is where we are now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the government held briefings in the Burdekin and in Mackay, the two largest sugar-growing districts in Australia, both in my electorate. As it is the middle of the crushing season, I was surprised by the large number of farmers who took the time out of their busy schedule to attend these forums. That just highlights the importance of this code of conduct to their future. The feedback from those farmers was that the code was essential for the survival of their industry. In addition to the briefings, other stakeholders have presented their views in submissions to the review process. One such submission, and a very important one, is from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. I say this submission is important because critics of the code have argued against it on the grounds of its effect on competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC has confirmed what farmers already knew: that the code should be kept in place because it's an appropriate means of addressing the lack of competition and the unfair power that these foreign-owned milling companies actually wield in negotiations. The ACCC's recommendations are that the obligation upon mill operators to provide sugar cane growers with grower choice be activated in the code and that civil pecuniary penalties and, thereby, infringement notices be introduced for all breaches of the code. The department will take heed of the ACCC's submission and, indeed, all submissions made through the review process, and they're going to present their recommendations to the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources in November. The minister will then take the appropriate actions, and I understand the minister intends to complete that process without delay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who first brought this issue to Canberra and who oversaw the initial consultation process with farmers through the task force, I'm very proud to say that the Liberal-National government listened to the concerns of the community and of farmers and took action. I'm now seeing the positive response that action has received on farms around my electorate and around the state of Queensland, in particular. I have confidence that the success of the sugar code of conduct will see it remain as the chief mechanism to bring fairness back to the farms and to give sugar cane farmers a fighting chance for their future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  The distance between Canberra and Sydney is 286 kilometres and the distance between Canberra and Melbourne is almost three times that at 662 kilometres, so it's understandable to ask why on earth the price of a flight between Sydney and Canberra is up to four times higher than that of a flight between Sydney and Melbourne. A last-minute flight from Canberra to Sydney tomorrow will cost you $263 at best, with no luggage and no flexibility, but tomorrow you can get from Sydney to Melbourne for just $80—less than one-third of the price. This is absolutely outrageous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month I received a letter from Canberran Monica Millgate, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are constantly shocked by the cost of airfares to and from Canberra in comparison to the rest of the country and wonder why this is happening. I work for a charity organisation and my partner is a motor mechanic, like many others in Canberra we are not high earners. The cost of airfares really puts my family at a disadvantage.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Monica is not alone. Since I started this campaign, countless Canberrans have told me about their expensive experiences, especially last-minute trips for funerals, so I wrote to the CEOs of Qantas and Virgin Australia asking them to please explain—'Please tell me why these airfares are so expensive.' The response was completely underwhelming. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Qantas told me that $23.97 goes directly to Canberra Airport, which is by far the most expensive capital city airport in the country, according to them. Other than that, their advice was to book early. That was all of the advice. It failed to get to the nub of the question as to why so many Canberrans are paying $300-plus to fly from Canberra to Sydney. I wrote to them again because I was not satisfied with the answer. I asked for a breakdown of their fares. I'm happy to report that I'll be meeting with the Qantas government relations team this afternoon for an update. So, Canberrans, watch this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Virgin Australia are yet to reply to my letter, so last week I wrote to them again asking for them to please explain. Once again, I'm yet to see a reply. On top of these outrageous prices, my community is still seeing flight cancellations almost double the national average. Just this week six flights have been cancelled and, as we speak, two flights are delayed at Canberra Airport. I feel sorry for anyone relying on getting to Sydney today. That's a regular story for Canberrans. This is simply unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to popular belief, not all Canberrans are politicians. Contrary to popular belief, many of them are not on high incomes. I've started this campaign. I encourage all Canberrans to get in touch with me to share their experience. I'll continue to fight for my community for fair fares for Canberra.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  Just a few moments ago in this place the inquiry into the National Road Safety Strategy was launched. I want to congratulate Professor Jeremy Woolley and Dr John Crozier for the work that they've done on behalf of the government to look at the National Road Safety Strategy and to establish what steps they believe the government needs to take to reduce the impact of road trauma on our nation. The target obviously is zero deaths and zero injuries on our roads. When I met with colleagues in my previous role as the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport I was touched by the number of colleagues who have had direct experience of road trauma—in their own families, amongst their own friends and in their own electorates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I simply don't accept that 1,200 Australians have to die on our roads each and every year—that 100 people have to die every month on Australian roads. There are those of us who live in rural and regional communities, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan. A disproportionate number of those people who are killed or injured on our roads are from our regional communities. Less than one-third of all Australians live in regional areas, but they make up more than two-thirds of our road trauma statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's a very important report that was received today by Deputy Prime Minister McCormack. It is also very important that the shadow minister, Anthony Albanese, was there for the launch and that the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Road Safety were there as well. The Parliamentary Friends of Road Safety is an organisation I helped establish with Senator Alex Gallacher in the other place, who is a man who has a deep conviction and a passion for reducing road trauma in our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the keys to the inquiry's reports relates to the need for a national approach to road safety. While we have at the moment quite a disjointed system where each of the state jurisdictions has primary responsibility for road safety, I believe that there is capacity for the federal government to play more of a coordinating role and to bring the states together. The reason I say that is that there can't be more than one best practice in Australia. Each of the states thinks they are doing best practice, but they're all quite different in the way they approach the issue. Take, for example, the approach to learner drivers and the number of hours they need to achieve before they can apply for a probation licence—it varies across jurisdictions. We have road laws that vary across state jurisdictions. Some states are prepared to implement point-to-point cameras to detect speeding drivers and others are not prepared to do that for light-vehicle operators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage the states to work in a collegiate and collaborative manner with the federal government. I'd encourage the Deputy Prime Minister to look closely at the report, which I know he intends to do, and encourage those opposite, particularly the shadow minister, to work in a constructive way with the government—as they always have done—in relation to road safety matters. It's an important report. It's one that I sincerely want to thank Jeremy Woolley and John Crozier for undertaking on behalf of the Australian people. I look forward to working with the Deputy Prime Minister as we achieve our target of zero deaths and trauma related to road safety.</span>

Day is a national day of action. It's held each year to remind people to ask those around them—their friends, their family, their work colleagues, their neighbours—the simple question: 'Are you okay?' It's a small question, a very simple question, but it can mean a lot to someone who might be struggling. It's not just about the question; it's about the conversation that it starts. It gives people an opportunity to talk about what might be weighing on their mind and about strategies to better manage the load. It gives the asker an opportunity to really listen and, importantly, it gives people an opportunity to ask for support. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I visited a school in my community, St Eugene's at Burpengary, where years 6 and 7 students made an important link between R U OK? Day and the mental health issues that drought-stricken farmers have been enduring in recent times. While I was there, we discussed the issues that farmers are facing, the impact the drought is having on some farmers' mental health and the strategies to help them get back on their feet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also presented with letters from a number of the students that I met, like Khiana in year 6 and Sarah in year 7. They outlined their concerns and proposed some really good policy ideas to ease the pressures caused by the drought. In some of their letters, like Ilkut's or Jackson's that I have here, the students asked me to take their message to Canberra so they can have their voices heard. True to my word, I have done exactly that: I have their letters right here with me. I raised some of the issues in these letters with my parliamentary colleagues and I intend to discuss them with shadow ministers who can consider some of the messages and some of the proposals that these students have written. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In one of these letters, Sofie, from grade 6, noted that her grade will be here in Canberra tomorrow for R U OK? Day. Sofie, I'm hoping to meet you and your friends from St Eugene's tomorrow so I can directly hear from you what you think we, as politicians, should be doing, what the Australian parliament should be doing. I know that, as young people, it can sometimes feel like your voices aren't being heard, but I will say to you, your friends and all of the other young people in Longman: I want you to know that I'm listening. I'm listening. I want to hear from you, and I'm really looking forward to hearing from the St Eugene students here tomorrow in Parliament House about some of the solutions you have.</span>

It's a fabulous time of year. It's even nice and warm here in Canberra. The temperature was in double digits this morning, which is certainly tropical for this time of year. It's a wonderful time of year for the weather but also it's a fabulous time of year as we see the changeover from our winter sports season to our summer sports season. At this time of year, we see our football finals, and I want to give a big shout-out to Beenleigh Buffaloes Australian Football Club and Park Ridge Pirates Australian Football Club, who are contesting the grand final in their competition this Sunday. Both teams have had a fabulous season, and it's terrific to see two local teams in the grand final. I'm pleased to say they both succeeded at the expense of Gold Coast based teams, so I'm very happy about that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, I want to give a shout-out to all of the winter sporting clubs, because they all have demonstrated the value of sport to our community over the past five or six months. That includes my AFL clubs at Ormeau, Beenleigh and Park Ridge; my football clubs—as in soccer, the world game—at Loganholme, Ormeau, Park Ridge and Bethania, and not just the seniors in these clubs but, importantly, also the juniors; and my rugby league clubs at Ormeau, Eagleby, Beenleigh (juniors and seniors), Waterford, Logan City (the Hawks) and Chambers Flat (the Mustangs). All of these clubs survive, day in and day out, because of the enormous work and contribution of the volunteers at the clubs. They are all clubs that each and every season put teams on the park in a variety of divisions to ensure that there are opportunities for kids who want to play sport at the level that they are capable of playing at.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been really heartening over the past few years has been to see the growth of women's sport in my electorate, across all of the codes that I've mentioned today—AFL, soccer and rugby league. It would be fair to say that I actually enjoy watching the women's games more, particularly in AFL and rugby league. The ladies get stuck in, and the matches are really entertaining games of AFL, soccer and rugby league to watch. Loganholme FC's team in the women's NPL this year struggled, sadly, but it was their first year there, and I'm sure they'll go on to bigger and better things next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  It was a great pleasure to host Prime Minister Scott Morrison in Townsville last week, where he made an important announcement for the local economy: the Liberal-National government has committed $75 million to a channel capacity upgrade at the Townsville port. The Prime Minister, as Treasurer, also visited Townsville after the 2018 budget. In addition to visiting the construction site of the Townsville stadium, we discussed the channel upgrade at the port of Townsville with the Townsville port CEO, Ranee Crosby. The federal government had previously introduced laws that meant capital dredge spoil had to be disposed of on land, which added a massive financial burden onto the port with its upgrade project. The Prime Minister listened, understood the issues and appreciated the value that the channel upgrade would bring to Townsville and to North Queensland more widely, including 120 jobs during construction and 245 ongoing jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The port upgrade will be funded with part of the $150 million that the federal Liberal-National government had previously committed to the Townsville Eastern Access Rail Corridor project, the TEARC project, which had been shelved because of a business case; it will be picked up again when that project is more commercially viable. The PM wanted to ensure that the money originally committed to Townsville stayed in Townsville, and I've got to say that the port project was the perfect way to keep that money invested in the local economy. That was my view and that was the view of the Herbert LNP candidate, Phillip Thompson. It is through port investment and the increased economic activity that it will bring that the Townsville Eastern Access Rail Corridor will become viable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Townsville region has done it tough economically through the downturn in the resources sector, with the housing market heading south, along with many workers losing their jobs, such as at Yabulu. Unemployment, particularly for young people, has been far too high. That's why I fought hard for investment in job-creating projects in the north—so we can reach our full potential and continue to be an economic driver for the rest of the state. That's why we're committing funds to studies and planning for Hell's Gate Dam, which can provide greater water security agriculturally for the region and new economic opportunities. That's why we as a government are so keen for the Singapore defence deal to bring benefits to local small businesses in the north. Townsville's a defence town, and the presence of the Defence Force barracks in the town drives a lot of local business. The Department of Defence recently briefed local businesses on how they can benefit from defence projects worth more than $2 billion through construction works on military bases in North Queensland and the Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative. I have pushed hard for fast-tracking the construction of the Haughton River bridge between Townsville and Ayr, which is creating 544 jobs. Not only will that make the Bruce Highway safer; those jobs are important. We're committing 750 jobs towards the construction of the Townsville stadium, where the PM's most-beloved Sharks will be handed a football lesson from the Cowboys in years to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  On 26 August, on a Sunday afternoon, I had the great joy to attend Tournament of Minds in the Hope Theatre at the University of Wollongong in my electorate. I thank the university for their support of this great program. Tournament of Minds is a problem-solving, challenge based program for primary and secondary students. It's designed to foster creative, collaborative and critical thinking. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this occasion there were 650 students, aged six to 16 years old, participating from 46 schools across our region. The program's open to all education sectors, but I would like to acknowledge that our public schools made up 83 per cent of those participating this year—38 out of the 46 schools. But all of the schools did a tremendous job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales South Coast region is one of 11 regions in the Tournament of Minds New South Wales, and over 350 students participated across New South Wales in 2018. It's a single event which is the culmination of weeks and months of high-quality extension, enrichment learning and exploration of the challenges that they're addressing. It's run at a regional level by volunteers. It was tremendous to see the Hope Theatre packed with hundreds of students, parents, teachers and volunteers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to present awards, and I congratulate all of the schools who won awards on the day. They were very excited and still being creative when having their photo taken with their award, doing all sorts of performances—they were obviously still pumped and enjoying themselves at the end of what had been a long session. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The schools that won in some sections had the opportunity to go on and compete at the state finals, and I want to particularly congratulate Warilla High School, who got honours in secondary STEM; Smith's Hill High School, who got honours in secondary Arts, and Smith's Hill High School, again, who were the winners of secondary Language Literature. This now means that the Smith's Hill High School team will travel to Darwin in October to represent the South Coast region and New South Wales at the international final. I think their facilitators Bryan Cutler and Amy Kang will be as thrilled as we are. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate and thank David Wassink and the team of volunteers who put innumerable hours in to make this opportunity for our students. You could see on the day that everyone had a tremendous time, and our future is in very good hands if they're the problem-solvers of the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  Very rarely do I use these speeches to vent my spleen, but I need to set the record straight and start calling out the Queensland state Labor government. Cairns port and the Cairns shipping development project has been a hot topic now for many, many years. Sadly, there are those in my community that have drunk the Kool Aid dished out to them by others whose only interest is throwing mud. However, I am one that likes to deal with real facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Queensland Labor government has made a big song and dance about the fact that they own the Cairns port. Given this, it's high time that they were held accountable. Cairns Port and associated dredging is wholly and solely the responsibility of the Queensland Labor government. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk held a press conference on 5 November 2015 where she announced Queensland's four strategic ports, and her announcement ultimately consigned the Cairns port to boutique status. She said at the time that the four Labor members in my seat were all consulted and totally supported this decision. It was then announced on 12 December 2015 that the Sustainable Ports Development Bill had been passed by the Queensland Labor parliament. I note Katter's Australian Party state MPs, who held the balance of power at the time, did absolutely nothing to stop the Cairns port being delegated to boutique status. I might also add that the Queensland government can change Cairns port's status at any time it wants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, the Queensland laws did not capture the Cairns shipping development project and the associated environmental impact statement as it was underway before the legislation was introduced. Fast forward three years and the likes of Curtis Pitt and Michael Healy made all sorts of promises during the 2017 state election about dredging funds for the Cairns shipping development project. However, six months later, the Queensland government did not allocate a single cent towards the dredging project in their 2018 state budget despite all of those promises. However, they did give the Townsville port $75 million for dredging and expansion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that the Queensland government is doing everything in its power to stifle millions, if not billions, of dollars worth of investment in Cairns? Why does the Queensland government continually neglect Cairns in favour of Townsville? The answer is quite simple: they're doing Bill Shorten's bidding for him. The Queensland Labor government is making a conscious decision to withdraw funding and support not just on this project but on others—strategic roads and water security projects—in my electorate. If Bill Shorten can fly in and make a grandiose announcement in a bid to embarrass the federal government, I fully intend to start calling out this morally corrupt and abhorrent behaviour on the part of the Queensland Labor government for what it is. It's about time the Queensland Labor government started putting the interests of Cairns and Far North Queensland ahead of its mates in Canberra. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  Western Australia is home to some incredible talent, skill and innovation, and nowhere more so than in the electorate of Cowan. I want to talk today about two very impressive small businesses that operate within my electorate. The first one is Sunvertec, which is run by a father-and-son duo, Kevin and Alex Davies. It's a high-technology company specialising in power conversion between isolated DC power sources and AC power. They've got years of experience, research and development and have produced a device called a direct drive inverter. These inverters are smaller and lighter and make installation quicker and easier. As a result of that, they can be manufactured through low-cost production techniques, enabling a general lowering of power costs to the end user. Sunvertec are currently working with power companies to discover additional controls over the digitally controlled storage inverter that can be used to enable increased penetration of distributed energy resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another amazing small business operating out of my electorate is Top EV Innovations, which is run by Michael Fragomeni. I've had the privilege of meeting with Michael on several occasions and going out and having a look at his operation. He works in partnership both locally and globally with electric vehicles, power technologies, industrial processes and commercial applications, looking at advanced propulsion systems and clean energy engineering. Top EV Innovations are actually building a drag car that is completely solar powered. Michael is also looking at graphene nanotechnology and leading-edge developments in production and infrastructure and advanced coatings for ultrahigh-power handling and lossless electrical components. So there is some really innovative work that has been showcased in several media by Engineers Australia and Regional Development Australia et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do these two amazing organisations in my electorate have in common? They're two exemplary small businesses at the cutting edge of renewable and sustainable energy solutions. Western Australia is set to triple its rooftop solar capacity by 2030, with more than 40 per cent of its energy mix to come from renewable energy. This is reported by Energy Networks Australia—ENA—and the CSIRO. I quote the CEO of ENA, John Bradley, who said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Western Australia is set to lead the edge-of-grid energy transformation in the coming decade and beyond as more customers continue to take up distributed energy resources like solar and batteries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I wish all of the organisations in my electorate the best of luck.</span>

It might seem surprising that someone who lives in Broken Hill is actually part of the sailing team at the Invictus Games. Marcus Wilson is the manager of the Royal Flying Doctor Service base in Broken Hill, which itself is an iconic location and an iconic base. His work there is very much appreciated.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marcus Wilson joined the Australian Army in 1988 and was discharged in 2002, having served as both a gunner and a medic. He was deployed in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, and in 1998 he was awarded the Nursing Service Cross there. In 2000, Mr Wilson was part of the Joint Incident Response Unit working to secure the Sydney Olympic Games. But, since suffering numerous musculoskeletal injuries and a damaged spinal cord, Mr Wilson says sport has quickly become part of his rehabilitation. Marcus Wilson said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Before putting my hand up for the Invictus Games, it was easier to stay at home and not exercise or socialise, which isn't a healthy strategy for anyone.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Up until now he claims that his greatest achievement has been being awarded the Bravery Medal. In Kabul in Afghanistan Mr Wilson helped rescue five passengers from a crashed helicopter. He was awarded the Bravery Medal for doing that.

He will be here with his wife, Meghan. I'm pleased to say that the royal couple will be visiting Dubbo, the only inland centre that they will be visiting. There are various reasons why this is an excellent choice. Dubbo is a thriving city. It's the capital of western New South Wales. It has a vibrant education sector. It is the service centre for a large agricultural region. It undertakes internationally acclaimed conservation work through the Taronga Western Plains Zoo. Dubbo is a wonderful example of a thriving community in western New South Wales. At the moment the city of Dubbo and its surrounds are in the grips of a drought, but I'm sure a visit by Prince Harry and his wife will be much appreciated.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Just how out of touch are the Liberals and Nationals when it comes to skilled workers and temporary work visas? News reports this week again show that the government have completely exited the space of making sure that locals get local jobs first. They are issuing more temporary work visas—like the 457 visa—to occupations which they previously slashed from the skilled occupations list. This is a demonstration that they have failed to invest properly in TAFE, and that they've failed to make sure that young Australians get the skills for the jobs that exist in Australia. It's scandalous that we have young people looking for work, older workers trying to retrain and can't get the TAFE courses they require and, as a result of not having enough skilled people locally, the government again looking to import these workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have to put the call out to the government: what are you doing to crack down on the exploitation of the temporary guest workers who are here in this country? Right now, as we speak, there are over 100 Chinese plasterers who are here as guest workers in our country. They are sitting in a shed in Hobart waiting to be paid. They have not been paid for over nine weeks now and counting. This isn't the first time that overseas workers have been so badly treated by employers in this country. It also happened at the Bendigo Hospital, where some workers were left as much as $20,000 out of pocket. This is what's happening on this government's watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than cracking down on the exploitation of temporary migrant workers, rather than ensuring that local kids get a start, and rather than limiting the use of 457 visas, this government goes after the unions. Instead, it bullies and picks on unions. It's hard to believe that it issued fines against the CFMEU for the issue at the Bendigo Hospital and not against the company which didn't pay its workers. It is disgraceful that again in question time we'll hear this government get up and bag out the CFMEU, who are the only people standing up for the workers in Hobart who haven't been paid.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this government's watch it is scandal after scandal. These workers come here in good faith to do a job, yet they are not being paid. When will this government crack down on the exploitation of temporary workers? And when will this government properly invest in TAFE so that we don't need to rely on temporary workers in this country and we give Australian kids and Australian workers a better go?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  There's nothing more thrilling in this job than when you get to see an almost magical change occur in someone's life as a result of something that a government has done. At the top of my mind right now is the recent decision by the government to list the medicine Orkambi on the PBS for children over the age of six years with the most common strain of cystic fibrosis. This medicine will provide over 1,200 people across Australia with a longer and better quality of life. The official line is that will be saving their families about a quarter of a million dollars a year each, but, of course, the reality is that but for this medicine being listed on the PBS almost none of these patients would have been able to afford it or receive it. So it's life changing for the patients and their families. That's what government should be all about: delivering these essential services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met with many people and many families over the past two years and heard their impactful stories about the daily and long-term challenges they face with cystic fibrosis. I remember one lady in particular who came up to my mobile office—I think it was at Teneriffe—on the side of the road and told me about how being involved in a clinical trial for Orkambi had enabled not just her but also her partner to return to the workforce. That's two people who have regained the security and dignity of work and, more importantly, regained their independence and their lives. I think that's what the Prime Minister probably means when he talks about a fair go for those who have a go. So congratulations to the entire cystic fibrosis community, who've worked so hard over many years to achieve this result. I'm thinking in particular of the tireless advocacy of Petrina Fraccaro, who's the CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Queensland. She and her team have done a lot of work to make this landmark PBS listing a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Orkambi is not the only instance where the federal government has stepped up and committed to funding life-changing medicines. Yesterday, the Minister For Health advised the House that two new medicines have been listed—one for 22,000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and another for the 140,000 Australian families who have a child affected by ADHD. Other recent examples include medicines for patients with neck and head cancer and rare types of leukaemia, new medicines for hepatitis C and diabetes and new treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and spinal muscular atrophy. Without all these medicines being listed on the PBS patients would only be able to obtain their benefits if they could afford the often hugely significant costs, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. That's a total of 1,870 new medicines that have been listed or amended under this government. That's one a day, and that is a great track record for this government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  On this day two years ago I stood in the House of Reps and gave my first speech, as the 1,152nd member elected to this parliament. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve the people of my community for the last two years. When I look back on that first speech that I gave, on the things that I've stood for and said I would serve, I look back with pride, having honoured the things that I said that I would do. I came in here, and I have been the person I said I was going to be. I continue to advocate for the things I believe in, and I do so with the integrity and the passion that I promised I would on behalf of the community that I represent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said, when I came in here, that we needed more women in this place, and I have stood by that. I've become the secretary for the Status of Women Caucus Committee and held consultations all over the country, talking about how we can better serve the women of this country. I instituted the Women of Lindsay Awards, recognising and honouring the women in my electorate who make things better for everybody. I stood up for women, mentoring and supporting them—young women in my electorate. I made sure that I didn't pull the ladder up after myself when I'd finally reached a position but stood there and held it while they continue to climb. I used my position in this House to smash the stereotype that DV only happens in certain communities and is limited to a certain stereotype. I made sure that I opened the women's community shelter in my electorate, with the women's community shelter network, and opened The Haven refuge, and I made sure that I fought for and continue to fight for DV leave so that women and children who need it are given that access. I continue to fight for ensuring that cross-examination in our family court system ends.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my first speech, I talked about making sure that kids with special needs were supported. I stood up for that, making sure that kids knew that not every parliamentarian held the view of some over in the Senate. I've served the inquiry into adoption and the low rates of local adoption: we've got 315 adoptions happening in a year but 48,000 kids in out-of-home care. I made sure that I served the inquiry into the family law court and the impact that family violence has on families. Now we're fighting the inadequate decisions that are being made on the other side to collapse the family law court into the Federal Circuit Court, which actually won't serve anybody, other than to save more money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said in my first speech that I would advocate for organ and tissue donors. I am proud that I've helped secure the event for the organ and tissue donor games in Brisbane in the next couple of years, and I will go to the launch event in Sydney in a few weeks time. I'm on the NDIS committee, and I continue to serve the committee, listening and working towards a better outcome. I have honoured everything that I said that I would. I finished my first speech with this quote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If you're going to be passionate about something, be passionate about learning. If you're going to fight something, fight for those in need. If you're going to question something, question authority. If you're going to lose something, lose your inhibitions. If you're going to gain something, gain respect and confidence. And if you're going to hate something, hate the false idea that you are not capable of your dreams.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="188315" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise and speak about one of the great community success stories in my electorate of Forde. The Beenleigh Theatre Group is, indeed, the quintessential acorn that's grown into a sturdy oak and this year is celebrating its 40th year of bringing entertainment to our community. On 29 May 1978, Beenleigh residents Dan and Margaret Gregory called a meeting at their home to gauge interest in forming a theatre group. The response was immediate and positive, and the house on Main Street was packed to overflowing. The Beenleigh Theatre Group, or BTG as it has become known, was born that night. The first production of the Beenleigh Theatre group was staged in November of that year, 1978, at the Memorial Hall in Beenleigh, but only after negotiations with the local Quota club, who, in an act of generosity, kindly gave over one of their highly prized booked nights, allowing the group to offer a hugely successful two-night season. That production was <span style="font-style:italic;">Oklahoma!</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Beenleigh Theatre Group has had a remarkable history, surviving the limitations of a very small community when it launched. The population in Beenleigh at the time was some 4,000, but the group has flourished since and is now a fixture in a much larger community, hosting booked-out seasons year after year. Since 1993, the Beenleigh Theatre Group has called the Crete Street Theatre home, and the group now offers something for all ages. It has expanded its operation to including the highly popular Junior Entertainers Theatre School, or JETS, which teaches young people from five to 18 years of age all aspects of theatre craft, including theatre etiquette, audition technique, singing, dancing and acting. In 2007, the Beenleigh Theatre Group formed the community choir, A-Chord, open to anyone with a passion for singing, and, in 2011, the inclusion of a community based orchestra was also finalised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 40 years of success of the Beenleigh Theatre Group is no fluke. It's a result of selfless dedication and tireless commitment by scores of local residents from my community of Forde. This same volunteer spirit offered by thousands of Australians across hundreds of communities, large and small, is part of the backbone of our nation, and it's one of the features that makes our nation the envy of the rest of the world. On November 16, this year, the Beenleigh Theatre group's season of <span style="font-style:italic;">Oklahoma!</span>, a celebration of their very first production 40 years ago, will open at the Crete Street Theatre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commend to the House the Beenleigh Theatre Group and the scores of volunteers who have contributed to its success over four decades, including its current president, the well-known and highly respected Ian Maurice, and his very able committee.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  Something very special happened this week. Beginning on sunset, 10 September, and ending at nightfall on 11 September, which was yesterday, we marked the beginning of the Islamic new year, also known as Arabic new year or Hijri new year. Islamic new year marks the al-Hijrah of the Prophet Mohammed from Mecca to Medina in 1622 CE. The evening of Sunday, September 9, just past, to the evening of September 11 marks Rosh Hashana, the beginning of the Jewish new year, and it so happens that the Coptic Orthodox Christian new year also falls on 11 September, which was yesterday. It is incredible that these three faiths are all celebrating new year in this week. The fact that these three different sets of belief with common origins intersect on the same day reminds us all of the beautiful diversity of the electorate of Barton and that of modern multicultural Australia. The Arabic, Jewish and Coptic communities are major and valued communities in the electorate of Barton, and I am very proud to represent them. I wish all of the people in those three communities and their families a very happy new year this week.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 3 September in Barton, we also held a health forum. Over 100 residents and healthcare practitioners gathered at Hurstville Club Central, joined by the member for Ballarat, Catherine King, the shadow minister, for a forum on health and hospitals. Many residents expressed concern about rising medical costs, including out-of-pocket expenses and private health insurance, while local healthcare practitioners spoke of their frustrations about the government's cut to hospitals. From 2017 to 2020, the Liberal government will have cut $700 million from public hospitals across Australia, including $5.46 million from St George Hospital. St George Hospital has over 500 beds. It is a very important hospital for surgeries, and wait times for those surgeries have increased. St George Hospital's median wait time for category 1 surgery is also two days above the national median of 11 days. Labor has announced an investment of $80 million in MRIs and Medicare licences, something that St George Hospital is very frustrated about not having.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  On 5 September, I was delighted to officially launch the ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Innovation and Biomedical Imaging Technology, also known as CIBIT, at the University of Queensland. Through the Australian Research Council Industrial Transformation Training Centres scheme, the Australian government fosters close partnerships between university based researchers and other research end users to provide a high degree of innovation through research and postdoctoral training vital to Australia's future. The University of Queensland was awarded $4.7 million to establish this ARC training centre, which will build multidisciplinary links between researchers and within industry to develop smart probes and smart scanning, harnessing the digital revolution for better, more cost-effective diagnostic imaging and improved health outcomes. The ARC centre, located within the Centre for Advanced Imaging at the University of Queensland, expects to train 20 industry-ready innovation scientists, who will undertake industry-driven research to overcome bottlenecks in the development and application of novel diagnostics, therapeutics and theranostics and to inform changes in regulatory policy that support industry growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you consider that the radiopharmaceutical market is expected to reach $9 billion by 2020 and Asia's diagnostic market is the fastest growing, it is pleasing that such instrumental research and collaboration is being achieved in our own backyard. By establishing collaborations within the biomedical imaging technology industry, both UQ and this training centre are placed at the nexus of a significant collaborative research network. The coalition government recognises the integral and significant part that science, research and innovation play in our economy. Science, technology and innovation are key drivers of our government's plan for a stronger economy. They help to generate jobs and higher living standards for all Australians and others worldwide. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017-18, the coalition government invested $10.3 billion in Australia's research, science and technology capabilities, underscored by a $1.9 billion investment to update our national research infrastructure in this year's budget. The research, development and commercialisation being undertaken and achieved at UQ are a credit to the many painstaking hours of dedication by everyone involved. Congratulations, University of Queensland. I look forward to the medical advances and breakthroughs from your facility which will bring improved healthcare benefits to Queenslanders and, indeed, all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  Colleagues, can I have your attention, because I want to tell you about one of the most exciting, innovative projects being undertaken in Australia. It's in my electorate of Indi and it's called Towards a Totally Renewable Indi. It's a unique plan; it's a first mover. It's about distributed energy and it's about a partnership all along the supply chain—bottom up, inside out and top down—and I believe we've got a template that can be applied right across Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let me give you some statistics, colleagues. In Yackandandah, the epicentre of this project, 50 per cent of the community of 1,200 households are on solar. There are 170 smart-controlled devices, Ubis, that are managing voltage. We've got two commercial minigrids—in Yackandandah, funded by Mondo, and in Osbornes Flat, funded by ARENA. These wonderful microgrids combine poles and wire, storage, generation, smart-controlled devices and, of course, people and customers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, colleagues, the real aspect of this that's so important is our community retailer. The community retailer is what actually makes this so special. In my electorate of Indi we've got 650 people who have signed up to a locally owned and locally operated retailer. So let's talk a bit about community retailer objectives for north-east Victoria. We have a number of things that we're trying to do. We're talking about a really effective transition to renewables, prototypes of sharing electricity around a community and setting up a trading platform in this way, locally generated electricity, social and economic development and empowering local communities. I know this is something every member of this parliament wants to see. So let me give you a bit more detail. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the wonderful things that have happened in my electorate is we've got the community engaged in renewables, in having effective, efficient and price-sensitive electricity in a sustainable way. So I say to the Prime Minister, these are not and/or; we can do this together. My community has worked so hard, and I need to acknowledge that. I want to say to the people from Yackandandah who are here today: terrific work. To our previous Prime Minister, the former member for Wentworth: what a fantastic job you did for this country with your work on the NEG. I'm so sad it hasn't got where it needs to go. To the member for Kooyong: thank you for visiting Yackandandah and giving your support to what we know is going to be the way of the future for community controlled energy, sustainability, price sensitivity and, most importantly, for giving customers the ability to choose where they want to go with their energy. It's a prototype that I put out to all my colleagues. Pay attention to what's happening in Indi.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  Throughout my term in parliament I've been a proud supporter of the Frankston Football Club, the VFL's Dolphins, and I am also a proud 2018 member. A couple of months ago Frankston City Council in my electorate put $650,000, which they upped to $850,000, towards a new $2.5 million television broadcast lighting project for SkyBus Stadium for night VFL and VFLW games and hopefully also an AFL and AFLW game. They then sought both state and federal funding. Michael Lamb, the Liberal candidate for Frankston, Matthew Guy and the state Liberal opposition took the lead, committing $650,000 down in Frankston. This was matched by the state government. This brought total local and state funding to $1.5 million, leaving $1 million more needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the community knows, I have been fighting for budgeted federal funding for many months, so I was pleased to recently announce that I had secured costed and budgeted federal funding of $850,000 towards this lighting project. Frankston City Council have promised to secure the other $150,000 needed. This means $1 million extra, which means the lights are fully funded. This promise is not reliant on a future election; it is budgeted funding. This means that the council can get started as soon as the season is finished so we can hopefully have new lights up and running for the 2019 football season. This is fantastic and will mean night VFL Dolphins games and night VFLW Southern Saints games, as well as night games for local league teams, can be held. I have also recently talked to and written to Gil McLachlan, CEO of the AFL, about securing a night AFL and AFLW game in the 2019 season. I'll keep up this conversation, and with your support and the support of the community perhaps we can secure this for next season. This will really help local small business and put Frankston on the national stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also congratulate the Frankston Football Club on their first year back in the VFL. They have now put in place a strong board, processes, fundraising, a coach and a team, as well as membership and community support, that will see them stronger and better than ever not only off the field but also hopefully on the field in future. I clearly remember the turmoil of a couple of years ago when they lost their VFL licence. I remember driving down to the city to meet with AFL management, which secured an initial delay in their decision. I remember working with Peter Geddes and Ken Rowe to call together the first steering committee meetings to bring the Dolphins back into the VFL, with the first meeting held in my old office. The steering committee and the board put strong processes in place, and politicians of all colours got together. I'm also thankful to the federal government, who put $200,000 into building a function centre, which was critical to their fundraising last year to get their licence back as well as to their fundraising this year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  On Thursday 30 August my constituents awoke to the largest industrial fire in Melbourne in over two decades. The massive black plume of smoke billowing from the West Footscray warehouse was visible from all over Melbourne's west. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to stay indoors as toxic smoke filled the air. Over 50 schools and childcare centres were closed, and businesses and roads were shut. Hundreds of firefighters battled the blaze for over 17 hours before it was contained, and the fire continued to burn for a week after this. The fire devastated the local environment in my electorate. The vast volume of water needed to contain the fire carried dangerous chemicals stored on the site to the nearby Stony Creek, a waterway that flows through residential areas and urban reserves such as Cruikshank Park on its way to the Yarra River at the West Gate Bridge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stony Creek has been reclaimed and restored through the efforts of the Friends of Stony Creek, a community group, over a period of decades. Through their hard work Stony Creek and Cruikshank Park have become much-loved urban oases in my community. They have now been rendered desolate. Wildlife is non-existent, and people have been told to avoid contact with the water at the site. A black deposit now lines the creek, and a strong stench remains. People living in houses overlooking Stony Creek are still reporting health effects such as headaches, nausea and respiratory issues from these chemical fumes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents want answers. Many have gathered at a series of town hall meetings to ask how this could have happened. It beggars belief that dangerous chemicals able to fuel such an inferno could have been stored so close to residential areas entirely unbeknownst to authorities. Following the fire a WorkSafe and EPA blitz of nearby industrial sites found an astonishing 68 infractions relating to the handling and storage of dangerous goods in the area. It is not good enough, and these agencies have their work cut out for them to restore community confidence in their regulatory oversight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community expects that those who are responsible for the fire and its consequences are held accountable</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A police investigation into the circumstances of the fire is currently ongoing, and I will not pre-empt that process. I do, however, note that the sole director of the company that owns the site of the fire had been raided recently by the ATO as part of a crackdown on illegal phoenixing operations—and he is, in fact, currently a director of 26 companies and a former director of 106 companies. Labor has been campaigning for stronger measures to prevent phoenix activities being used by companies to avoid their obligations, and higher penalties for those involved in such activities. I'll be watching the aftermath of the fire closely in this context. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the focus shifts to recovery, we must also ensure appropriate resources are made available to rehabilitate the local environment. We all have a responsibility to ensure that the community regains its vibrant green spaces as soon as possible. Government agencies will lead the effort, but our local volunteer groups are eager to contribute.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services, Housing and Disability Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  In the face of another grossly misleading campaign by Labor, I rise to reiterate my strong support for a phase-out of the long-haul live sheep trade. I want to make clear what happened in the House of Representatives two days ago. The bill passed by the Senate this week was co-sponsored by the Greens and Senator Hinch, and was similar in terms to the private member's bill introduced by the member for Farrer and me on 21 May: this was a motion to debate the bill only. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Labor won't tell you is that our private members' bill to phase out the export of live sheep to the Middle East over five years is currently being debated in this very Chamber. The games by Labor—to bring on a motion to debate this bill passed by the Senate on a date to be fixed—on the very first day of parliament under a new Prime Minister were a disingenuous attempt to disrupt parliament, masquerading behind the cause of animal welfare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Combined with the advocacy from so many thousands of Australians, we are pleased that our strong stand so far and the minister for agriculture's determination to hold the regulator to account have resulted in the shutting down of the industry's biggest offender. As a member of the ministry, it is no longer open to me to vote against government policy which includes any private members' bill. But I make one thing very clear: where were the member for Corio, the member for Hunter and the other Labor MPs when it was Labor policy to support the long-haul export of live sheep? They were nowhere to be seen. They did not have the courage to take a stand. People are suggesting that, had the vote been different in the House of Representatives, we would have had the bill as a reality. Now, that's not actually possible. Firstly, the motion was simply to debate the bill, not to pass it; and, secondly, all of the crossbench would have been required to support the bill, and they don't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What our actions have done is shine a light on this awful trade and on the need for major reform. No shipment of live sheep has left Australia since 6 June, and it's likely there won't be another until October. There has been no trade during the current northern summer, a critical time when sheep are under enormous stress. Let's not forget that the science makes it clear, from no less than the Australian Veterinary Association, that export during the northern summer should be banned because of the very high risk to animal welfare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impending release of the Moss review provides the government with a further opportunity to impose tough new laws. I expect that this report will be scathing, and will expose that the exporters have been operating unlawfully and the regulator has failed dismally for years. My personal conviction on this issue remains and, on behalf of the people of Corangamite, I will continue to advocate for a change in coalition policy and for a phase-out of this awful trade.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I rise to once again condemn the lack of appropriate planning and the lack of proper community consultation by the New South Wales Liberal government when it comes to the WestConnex project. The fact is that this project will be studied in history as how not to plan a project—a project that began with the recommendation from Infrastructure New South Wales to increase access to the port at Botany by duplicating the M5, as the No.1 priority that they identified. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a road costing $16.8 billion on the surface—but, of course, a lot more than that in reality—which doesn't go to the port, doesn't go to the airport and doesn't go to the city. It is becoming a road to more roads and, what's more, a toll road which will impose severe financial hardship on people in Western Sydney and other people who use this road. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Half the share of this road was last week, extraordinarily, sold off to a consortium led by Transurban, for some $9.3 billion. It is extraordinary that a road that is still halfway through construction, for which the Rozelle Interchange has still not been approved and properly planned, has been sold off to a private consortium for that price. What that does is ensure that there will have to be compensation for the private owner of WestConnex if any changes are made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we find that the New South Wales government have announced that $2.6 billion will be required to build the Sydney Gateway project from the St Peters Interchange through to the airport. That's further taxpayers' money going towards this project. We know that it's also proposed to have an F6 through to the Sutherland Shire, and a Northern Beaches Tunnel from the Rozelle Interchange, under Sydney Harbour, at the cost of many more tens of billions of dollars, if you add all this up. This is why the planning has been so appalling for this project, with real consequences for all of the people of Sydney.</span>

I want to note that it is Greens policy to ban the live cattle trade. Maybe it wasn't in that bill, but it is Greens policy and therefore more likely to become Labor Party policy. It has never been ours. Our bill is about removing the unnecessary and cruel toll taken on livestock, sheep, being moved to the Middle East.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, by its association with the crossbench bill, is backing the supporters of a ban on the live trade of cattle. Labor and the Greens have taken what I saw as a critical animal welfare issue and turned it into a base, crass political opportunity. Do we really believe that the side opposite care about farmers, a sensible transition policy and the future of jobs, particularly in Western Australia? By their recent actions, it would appear not. People are suggesting that, had the vote been different in the lower house yesterday, we would have had that bill as a reality. That's actually not possible, for a number of reasons. Crossbench support for bringing on a vote does not mean crossbench support for the bill itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we haven't seen a shipment of live sheep leave Australia since 6 June—and I can't see one now on the horizon until October at least—I'm confident that our private member's bill and the debate surrounding that bill, and the actions taken to date, are already having an effect. There has been no trade during the current northern summer, the critical time when sheep are under enormous stress.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two different ways of arguing your case, and it's important to distinguish between the two. I didn't necessarily expect my private member's bill to pass the House. This is very similar to the gay marriage debate. The gay marriage debate saw many private members' bills, for a range of different circumstances, sponsored by different members of parliament, but they all helped on the road to the result. A private member's bill causes discussion and debate. That marker on the road to reform has been very strong and very important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over this week, the minister will receive a review about his own department and the regulator. I believe that will demonstrate that the regulator has been approving shipments for years and years that should never have been approved. I commend the minister for his strong action with the Moss review of his own department and the implementation of the McCarthy reforms, which will make a vital difference in measuring not just mortality in sheep shipments but welfare, because this has always been about animal welfare, the economics of the sheep industry and the future of Western Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise in support of a constituency that's been consistently left out in the cold by the coalition government and by some of this country's biggest businesses. As a proud member of the Australian Workers Union for nearly all of my adult life, I stand in solidarity with the 1,600 AWU members working at Alcoa in Western Australia. The employees of Alcoa at five sites across Western Australia are the latest casualties of the merge, purge and gouge mentality of some multinationals. Following more than 20 months of enterprise bargaining negotiations, Alcoa's workers have taken indefinite industrial action against their multinational employer. The workers are simply asking the company to preserve existing workplace conditions. Instead, Alcoa wants to terminate the current employment contract and force workers to accept an inferior offer, an offer which introduces forced redundancies, keeps casual workers casualised and locks in a real pay cut for thousands of employees. When this substandard workplace agreement was put to Alcoa's 1,600 strong workforce, some of whom have worked for the company for more than 30 years, over 80 per cent voted it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody enjoys a strike. It's not just the act of standing out in the cold, wind and rain—an appropriate metaphor for the contempt that this government and some of its big business backers have for working people—and it's not just the loss of income. Each Australian worker in Western Australia has already given up thousands of dollars in pay. The Alcoa workers simply want secure jobs and fair conditions, the jobs and conditions that they fought for decades to establish. The coalition government claims to hate regulation, but it's the first to break out the red-tape dispenser if it can be used to restrict the right of workers to take industrial action against unfair conditions. The truth is that when it comes to driving down wages and ripping up workplace conditions, this government and their multinational backers like Alcoa are joined at the hip. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alcoa is known to have made hundreds of millions of dollars in corrupt payments to officials in Bahrain for over 20 years but hasn't been able to guarantee its loyal workers the same pay and conditions for the last 20 months. What does it say about industrial relations in this country when a multinational can pay bribes, but it can't pay its workforce? Alcoa is firmly engaged in a sick race to the bottom against other multinationals, where each company competes to minimise tax, suppress wages and casualise its workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I lend my strongest support and solidarity to the AWU members at Alcoa in Western Australia. I applaud them for their courage, and I wish them a speedy and satisfactory resolution to this industrial action.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I rise to discuss the cashless welfare card legislation, which passed the House and the Senate yesterday to roll out the fourth trial area in this country in the Hinkler electorate. I want to thank a few community members. It has taken 18 months of consultation, debate, legislation and discussions. It couldn't have been done without the strong support in the community from people like Faye Whiffin, who runs the local community centre in the small town of Howard; Brian Courtice, the former Labor member for Hinkler, who stood on his feet and supported the cashless debit card publicly and very, very vocally; John Russo, in Childers; Tim Sayre, from the Bundaberg Chamber of Commerce; Jan Carlson, from We Care 2, a charity in Hervey Bay; Steve Beer and Tanya O'Shea, from IMPACT; Pastor Ross Davie, from Hervey Bay; and our two local newspapers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not often that you go out and give a rap to your local media, but on this occasion I have to absolutely give my support to the <span style="font-style:italic;">News Mail </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fraser Coast Chronicle</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>who took the initiative to pay for a ReachTEL poll to prove there was very strong community support for the cashless debit card in the Hinkler electorate. That poll came back with less than 28 per cent against and, in terms of policies, that is as good as it gets. It was very strongly supported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It couldn't have been done without our local welfare workers, church volunteers, pastors, nurses, doctors, teachers and principals who spoke out and sent letters of support to my office. The police spoke out, and, I have to say, to their detriment. They were attacked by their employers, the Queensland Labor government, for simply stating the facts, in their view. Those police had to attend protests and sit in my office while people who were shipped in from other places as activists stood out the front and protested. It is very important that the ambulance officers and, in particular, an emergency ward nurse who put forward her view in an email very strongly are recognised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both of our chambers of commerce, in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg, and the Childers chamber and all of their business owners, were attacked for simply standing up and giving their point of view. Would you believe that there were people on social media actually declaring these businesses should be boycotted because they support something which will make a huge difference to our electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Social Services has been on the ground for around 18 months and running extensive consultation. I thank Ministers Tudge, Tehan and Fletcher—it took three ministers to get this done over a period of 18 months. To my staff, who have put up with the threats, the abuse and the really difficult job of going through all the social media posts—which they then had to delete because of the horrible language used; directed not only against me but also against others and individuals in the community—I thank them very much for their support. Finally, I thank the people of Hinkler, because they stood up for change in their region, which is a tough thing to do. It is a difficult policy but a necessary policy, and we will deliver.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to my friend Mary Day who passed away recently and so unexpectedly from liver cancer. Mary was a country girl from Warrnambool, a Labor activist, and long-time staffer to state and senior federal Labor MPs—the former members for Melbourne, Gerry Hand and Lindsay Tanner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although I have known Mary throughout my own involvement with the Labor Party, it was during our time here in Canberra, and especially during the Rudd Labor government years, that she and I became good friends. We shared accommodation for some years, especially during those exciting and what were to become tumultuous years of the Rudd Labor government and the night of 23 June 2010. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary and I developed our own way of dealing with the pace and atmosphere in this place, that all too often can be punishing and unforgiving. We really looked forward to getting back to the apartment each night, sitting on the couch and watching Tony Jones and <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>—Tony Jones was a bit of a circuit-breaker. In what we called our nightly debriefs, we'd analyse the day's events, pass judgements on the various shenanigans of this place, commiserate with each other about being away from home and talk about our families. She was so proud of her son, Nicholas. My daughter, Stella, looked forward to spending time with Mary when she came to Canberra. Mary had a way with kids. In fact Mem's shenanigans—as she was called by her family—were fondly recalled at her memorial service last Friday at the Kensington bowling club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary was a fierce and shrewd political operative. Many people feared her, but that's because she did not suffer fools lightly. She simply could not tolerate those who did not have the courage of their convictions or those who betrayed the collective. In the rough and tumble of politics, Mary Day was a formidable opponent. Very few people crossed Mary and escaped unscathed, but she was a loyal friend and a loyal comrade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary was a member of the Australian Labor Party because she had a fierce sense of social justice. Her electorate and parliamentary work allowed her to work very closely with the community she served and was committed to. In particular, she made it her mission to help and assist women and migrants. Working for a minister of immigration gave her an opportunity to help newly arrived migrants as they settled into our community. She was loyal to the parliamentarians she worked for, and always acutely aware of the need to protect them. She was loyal to her many friends and she was loved by her Labor family. Many aspiring young Labor activists sought Mary's counsel, and she relished guiding them through their political journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mary died suddenly of liver cancer, leaving many of us shocked and deeply saddened. She was such an important part of the history of this place during her many years here. She will be missed by everyone—no-one more than her son, Nicholas, to whom she was devoted. She was remembered last Friday by family and friends, with good humour and much love.</span>

Woolgoolga High School and Casino High School both made it into the final 16 from nearly 90 schools that entered the knockout competition. After a hard-fought grand final match, Woolgoolga High School came out victorious, winning the gold medal. The winning team consisted of captain Riley Saban, Billy Sutherland, Ciarnah Robertson and Matilda Mariringer. The team was managed by Kayla McIntosh and Joe Rees. The Casino team consisted of captain Onica Gaudry, Aleah Gaudry, Cameron Bell, Josiah Thomas and Bailey Quinn. Given that this was the first competition for several of the team to make the top 16, it was a great achievement. The team managers were Michelle Thompson and David Heath. I would also like to thank the Cerebral Palsy Alliance for their involvement with this tournament and for the opportunity it gives students across the state and in my electorate. Again, congratulations to all the competitors. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From when he was 12 years old, Tony Darragh knew he wanted to be a barber, and at 16 years of age he began his apprenticeship at Bill and Audrey Stephen Hairdressers in Lismore. Now, 50 years down the track, Tony celebrated five decades in the industry last month and is still cutting and trimming hair and offering shaves to his clients. For the past 35 years, Tony has been established in his own shop in the Lismore CBD, Tony Darragh Hair Cutting For Men. Customers even get to sit in a 1930's barber's chair. For Tony, cutting hair is very therapeutic, and his regulars will be happy to know he has no plans to retire, believing he will still be cutting hair in 10 years time. Tony, married to Loretta, is a stalwart in the community. Congratulations on 50 years of barbering, Tony. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kwong Sing's is celebrating 90 years of trading in general retail in Casino next year. It has sold everything from hosiery, crockery, glassware, groceries to footwear and just about everything in between. Frank Fatt worked in the Glen Innes store for over 27 years before he and his wife and their children moved to Casino to open his own Kwong Sing's in early 1929. As the store prepared to celebrate its first Christmas in Casino, the local paper wrote that, despite its short time in the town, Kwong Sing's had become a prominent store. Today, Frank's grandson Hilton owns and runs the business, which is still located in Barker Street, and now sells lingerie, clothing and shoes. Hilton's partner, Marie, and his daughters, Eliza and Sabina, have also been involved. Hilton's brother is also the famous purple member of The Wiggles, Jeff. Congratulations to Kwong Sing's on reaching 90 years in business.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  Last weekend I attended the Darwin Malayalee Association fundraiser, raising money for the victims of the devastating floods in Kerala in southern India. My family proudly donated to this important cause. I want to acknowledge the great work of the Darwin Malayalee Association, along with the Darwin Malayalee Forum, Tatvamasi, Syro Malabar community, the Jacobite orthodox community, the Darwin Strikers Soccer Club and others, including CAS Spices in Nakara and many others, who collected or donated money for the victims of the floods. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would especially like to acknowledge the contributions of the president, Rajeev Thayil, and Salas Abraham from the Darwin Malayalee Association and thank all the performers and volunteers who made the night such a great success. I want to thank Shyju, Jomon, Binu Paikadan, Matthew Mattam, Monsi Thomas, Robin Mathew, Sanju, Shajahan, Baby Abraham, Roy Joseph and all the families who prepared such delicious food for the evening. I also want to acknowledge the great contribution of the Malayalee community to Darwin and Palmerston in my electorate. Many members here probably don't realise that in Royal Darwin Hospital about 50 per cent of the nurses are from the Malayalee community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The flooding in Kerala, the worst in the area since 1924, has claimed close to 500 lives, with another 50 missing, while close to one million persons have been displaced. Kerala is a state with a population of around 35 million people, and its state government estimates that at least one-sixth of the total population of Kerala has been directly affected by the flooding and related incidents. The heartbreak suffered by the people of Kerala is exacerbated by the fact that this tragedy occurred at a time when they normally come together to celebrate the Hindu festival of Onam, an important celebration offering thanks for a great harvest. It's a situation that I know many of us have been monitoring closely. Many people in Darwin and Palmerston have been personally affected by the tragedy. I want to thank Dr Edwin Joseph and acknowledge his work with the Indian community and many organisations and committees in Darwin. He is a tireless community worker. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to remind everyone back in the Top End that if you've been affected by the flooding in Kerala—I know of someone who has been—my office is available to help in any way we can. God bless all those affected. You are not only in our thoughts and prayers; you are backed by our actions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  Businesses in our region are never shy to showcase themselves or have a well-deserved event to celebrate. The 2018 Shoalhaven Business Awards winners were absolutely no exception. In fact, it has become quite a tradition, and this year we saw many new names added to the list of outstanding excellence. Due to family reasons I was not able to attend. However, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate each one of the winners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Terry Rayner of ANZ Mobile Lending, South Coast and Southern Highlands, was named the Business Leader of the Year. Elise Gooda of Think Tank Business Services won Outstanding Young Employee of the Year. Our champion Young Entrepreneur is Dale Berry of Peak Fitness Huskisson. Cupitt's is on fire with accolades from so many sources, but locally gained awards for Excellence in Tourism and Hospitality, Excellence in Sustainability and Business of the Year. The team at My Travel Expert were awarded for Excellence in Small Business. Nowra Farmers Market was the winner for Excellence in Business and Excellence in Retail and Personal Services. Avalon Bourne with her foundation of Sonder Youth was listed as the winner for the Start Up Superstar award. Natalie Allan Consulting won Excellence in Innovation. The Employer of Choice was won by Hotondo Southcoast Pty Ltd, and a very good choice that was. They do amazing work for some groups and causes who just don't have the money for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Excellence in Community Service was won by Cullunghutti Aboriginal Child and Family Centre, and they are a game changer for cultural immersion and care for children and country. Pepperell &amp; Associates won the Excellence in Professional and Commercial Enterprise award. The Outstanding Home-Based Business was Think Tank Business Services. The Flagstaff Group, one of the many amazing disability employers, won Excellence in Workplace Safety. The Employee of the Year is Sarah Tebbutt, working at Eliza's Lighting. Kimberlie &amp; Co Cleaning were the winners of Excellence in Workplace Inclusion. Excellence in Social Responsibility was won by Nowchem. This company is quite exemplary in all that it does: sponsoring trainees, apprentices, youth activities, youth leadership enterprise, participating in local CBD events, attending a raft of business forums and employment forums, and the list just goes on. Frankly, if every business were in a position to echo this, the whole of Gilmore would be up in lights for excellence in achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to all these local businesses who have demonstrated excellence in their unique and wonderful ways. Not only that, they are all helping to reduce the unemployment levels in Gilmore. We've dropped from almost 30 per cent youth unemployment, when I was first elected in 2013, and we are now down to just over 14 per cent. I have to thank all of the organisations and all of the businesses in Gilmore who have been part of this game changer by employing youth in my region.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  One of the great highlights of being a representative in this place is celebrating the great sporting achievements of my electorate of Shortland, and I was pleased to host a presentation for Shortland's most recent Local Sporting Champions. Congratulations go to Megan Nay, Cameron Howard, Kaitlyn Klein, Abbey Taylor, Kurt Donoghoe, Bronson Romani, Colby Robins, Rosanna Jennings, Jonah Anderson, Joshua Redd, Zoe Peden, Jorgie Hills, Tahlie Park, Fergus Tayler, Michael Walker, Jude Jennings, Sienna Eve, Edan Shorten, Jessica Pickering, Remy Lovett, Jonah Pezet, Benjamin Harding, Chloe Smith, Leia Puxty, Ella Spicer, Cooper Severino, Annalee Grove, Callum Sharman, Lailah Clarke, Koby Hall, Josie Allan and Madison Mueller.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a pleasure meeting these fantastic young ambassadors for their various sports. While there are a variety of champions participating in sports such as basketball, athletics and netball, I was also pleased to recognise excellence in the less common disciplines, such as petanque, fencing and trampolining. Bronson Romani recently returned from New Zealand where he represented Australia in the men's open petanque team. He will be travelling to Canada this week to compete in the Petanque World Championships, and has already represented Australia on three separate occasions, the last as team captain and flag-bearer. Colby Robins is another great example of the calibre of sportspeople we have in Shortland. Colby is a member of the Newcastle Fencing Club, where this year he finished as the No. 1 under-13 epee fencer in New South Wales. Considering Colby has only been fencing for three years, that's quite an achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jessica Pickering is a member of the Eastlake Trampoline Sports team. Not only did Jessica compete in Melbourne in the national Australian Gymnastics Championships in June, where she won a silver medal in synchronised trampoline and came fourth in individual trampoline, but she also competed in New Zealand at the Trampoline Championships and Trans-Tasman Challenge in Auckland, where she won the gold medal in individual trampoline, and silver medals in both synchronised trampoline and their team event. She is also the New South Wales state CHS springboard diving champion. She recently placed third in the New South Wales all-schools championships, gaining her selection to represent New South Wales at the national school diving championships in Perth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The youth of Shortland certainly excel in many different areas. I congratulate the champions and their families and supporters on their well-deserved achievements. I also want to thank all the parents, guardians, aunts, uncles, grandmas and grandads who spend their weekends and their early mornings driving the kids to training. All these champions are fine athletes and they're great young people. They know how to set goals and work towards their goals. They excel not only in sport but also in their schoolwork and within their community. I congratulate all of them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  On Monday in the business section of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> the Chairman of Anglo American mining, Mark Cutifani, denigrated democratic systems in Australia and around the world by saying that leadership in Australia was incompetent compared to the leadership that he has seen in China. That's a very unfortunate remark, no matter how badly behaved people here were a couple of weeks ago. It does not reflect well on a major Australian businessman, born in Wollongong, to prefer the authoritarian system in China to the system here. I'm sure his view doesn't reflect the views of most people in Australian business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has brought to mind yesterday's well-written column by the international editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span>, Mr Peter Hartcher. He pointed out that former Treasurer of Australia Mr Hockey had been importuned by a very arrogant Beijing-based businessman, Lou Jiwei, who lit up a cigarette in his presence without permission—another put his feet on the chair—and demanded the right to buy Rio Tinto and a number of other leading Australian companies. The theme of Mr Hartcher's column was that there is an atmosphere of hubris in the Australian political sphere and that in the Pacific and East Asia we are witnessing the arrogance of the regime in Beijing. Of course, we've seen the incredibly cruel crackdown on a million Muslim people in East Kazakhstan. They are virtually living in concentration camps. They are forced to eat pork products and drink alcohol, which is not au fait with their religion. That's extremely regrettable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hartcher pointed out that, at the Pacific Islands Forum, the President of Nauru, Baron Waqa, had to actively sit down an official of Beijing who wanted to interpose himself and demanded to speak before ministers of the Pacific Islands Forum who were there on an invited basis. I and Mr Hartcher have noted that a leading Chinese academic in Beijing, Luo Jianbo, has said that Beijing's diplomacy needs to be improved. We in Australia have a good commercial, trading and economic relationship with the People's Republic of China. We've had in the last five years $200 billion of Chinese direct investment, according to the Foreign Investment Review Board. We should cling to that good trading and economic relationship. But, as the Beijing academic observed, they need to improve their diplomacy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  on indulgence—I rise to mark the passing of United States Senator John McCain. He was a man who gave a lifetime of service to his country in times of war and peace. He will be remembered here as a true friend of Australia. The McCain family's relationship with our nation has spanned the generations—from John McCain's grandfather, who sailed here in the early 1900s and then in the Second World War commanded US air forces in the South Pacific and later aircraft carriers, to his father, who was a submarine commander out of Perth during that war and then commanded US forces in the Pacific theatre during the Vietnam conflict, to the senator's own service in Vietnam and, more recently, the service of Senator McCain's sons in Iraq and Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the common threads is Australians and Americans serving together, and that shared service and sacrifice is something John McCain understood and valued. His time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam is well documented. It was undoubtedly a dark and excruciatingly painful time, both physically and mentally. And yet, having gone through that hellish period, after the war he supported the normalisation of relations between the United States and Vietnam. John McCain said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have looked back in anger at Vietnam for too long. I cannot allow whatever resentments I incurred during my time in Vietnam to hold me from doing what is so clearly my duty. I believe it is my duty to encourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes of our tragic war in Vietnam a better peace for both the American and the Vietnamese people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That generosity of spirit marked his time in politics as well. He was a man who was able to put aside partisan politics to serve the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no question that Senator McCain possessed a maverick streak. I think it could be said that he possessed a larrikin streak as well. And he was a straight talker. Those qualities are no doubt why Australians viewed him with such affection. They are sometimes said to be Australian qualities. But it was more than that. He understood the depth of the relationship between the United States and Australia, how important the Pacific is to global security and how important our alliance is to global security as well. Standing by your mates when the chips are down is another Australian characteristic, and Senator McCain was certainly the first to stand by Australia whenever he thought the relationship between our nations was threatened or imperilled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of briefly meeting Senator McCain when he was in Australia last year. During his visit he spoke of the bonds between our nations and how we are an alliance of free countries with shared values and a shared commitment to a safer, freer and better world. Australians will remember his courage, service, sacrifice and, above all, friendship. With John McCain's passing, we have lost a great friend, a great mate. We honour our mate in this House today. I extend the condolences of the Calare electorate to his family and to his country.</span>
