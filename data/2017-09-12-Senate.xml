                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  It is a delight to be able to contribute to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. Like many of those who have spoken on the debate already, it is important to start off by pointing out that the reforms we're debating here that are included in this legislation are indeed landmark reforms, not only in respect of the changes that they make to the legislative regime that applies to this part of the economy and to this form of communication, but also the fact—and I think this is more important—that they have the unanimous support of the Australian media industry. That in itself is a massive achievement. I have to commend the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield, for his amazing efforts in being able to secure this agreement and support right across industry. Without that, these reforms would not be the landmark set of reforms that they are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In debating this, we have to recognise that the Australian media landscape has indeed changed significantly over recent years, and also over the longer term as well. It's important that regulation that was designed for a specific set of circumstances and a specific type of technology that was available at the time keeps pace with the technology that has evolved since laws were put into place. The rules, the laws and the regulations need to be dynamic, like the technology available to the media sector itself is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important point, going back to the ability to achieve consensus in the industry on this legislation, is the fact that the government has been listening and has undertaken extensive consultation with industry and the community in preparing this legislation. I think that is an excellent example to be set in terms of how to bring about landmark reforms. The fact that we have listened means we do now have a package that will genuinely modernise regulation for this industry. As I've stated, given that technology has changed and, therefore, the laws need to now reflect that, it's important that, looking forward, we ensure we have legislation that is able to keep up with changes into the future. This is not a static thing; it's a case of being able to manage the dynamic environment, the changing environment, and the changing technologies in this sector into the future. We can't just make laws for now; they have to be futureproofed as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the elements of the package of legislation in the broader media reforms, these are the abolition of broadcasting licence fees for TV and radio, the introduction of spectrum use pricing, the ban on gambling advertising during sports broadcasts and children's shows, the anti-siphoning amendments scheme and list, the review of the Australian and children's content, and the $30 million fund for broadcasting women's and niche sports, which I was delighted to hear Senator Macdonald speak at length about just yesterday. He spoke about the importance of investing in both of those areas to develop both women's sports and niche sports, which don't receive the media attention they otherwise could. That is an exceptionally important part of this entire package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill goes to abolishing two of the five media cross-ownership rules and providing stronger local content protections for regional TV. Australia's media cross-ownership and control rules date back to the 1980s, a period when many great things occurred—including my birth!—but they haven't been substantially updated since 2006. That is why this piece of legislation today is so important. The laws as they stand, unamended, reflect the historic media environment, the traditional mediums and platforms available to media—TV, radio and print media—which of course are still important; no-one can deny that. But the laws as they stand today don't reflect the current environment, which now encompasses a great many more technologies in the way of social media, internet and the like. So we need to take stock of that and, again, this is why this legislation is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen massive changes in the ways Australians access information. The online world is where most people seem to turn to access their news, and social media is a significant part of that. Even many in this chamber would turn to Facebook and Twitter for breaking news rather than the TV and radio of days gone by, because it is more instantaneous, it is unfiltered and it is direct. That is a reality we have to accept, and that's why the amendments being proposed are important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges that face traditional media and how revenue is generated on audience shares is placing a burden on traditional media, which is leading to an uncompetitive situation. The ways in which our traditional providers of media operate and use of the existing platforms in this field do need updating so that they can remain competitive with these new and emerging technologies that are competing with traditional forms of media. A little bit later on I will come to the importance of these traditional mediums to regional Australia. Most of Tasmania is considered to be regional—almost its entirety. That's why they're important to my home state of Tasmania. Another reason it's important that this bill is passed is that it ensures that Australian media companies can compete against global media giants and maintain the local jobs, which is of particular importance, especially when you look at some of the smaller entities around Australia, and so that these companies can continue to provide the local content—again, something I will touch on in more detail when reflecting on the importance of local media to regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will, as is the government's intention, strengthen regional local content requirements to ensure that communities continue to have access to local news and content that is relevant to their communities and to their lives and to ensure that the information they're receiving actually does provide some benefit to their daily lives. That's something regional media has been able to do over many years and will, under these laws, continue to be able to do. It's important, though, that we do strengthen the operating environment for regional broadcasters to uphold the regional content requirements, and, as I said, the bill before us is something that goes a long way to doing just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the media ownership and control rules and the current situation, we currently have five rules in place that limit the control of commercial broadcasting, being TV, radio and newspapers. These rules are somewhat outdated and don't reflect, as I've said before, the contemporary digital media environment which we now operate in. All of us have these great things, these smartphones and tablets, which provide us with so much more information. But the rules, while they need changing, also need to ensure that the traditional forms of media are protected and supported as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rules as they stand, though, were developed in an analog environment that was dominated by only three platforms, as I've mentioned—free-to-air TV, free-to-air radio, and print. This was a time before smart TVs, internet radio and the technology of smartphones and tablets. The current control regime and the ownership rules regulate only those three platforms and are based on geographical areas, boundaries that have since been broken with the advent of the internet and the many other channels used to distribute and access online content. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will repeal two of the five current rules, the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. The 75 per cent reach rule applies to TV and prevents a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, from exercising control of commercial TV broadcasting licences whose combined licence area exceeds 75 per cent of the population of Australia. The rule was first introduced in 1987 as a 60 per cent rule and later increased in 1995 to a 75 per cent rule, obviously to reflect the changes at that time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As at October of last year, the figures for combined audiences were as follows: Channel 7 covered 74.51 per cent of the population; Channel 9, 73.96 per cent; and Channel 10, 67.31 per cent. For regional networks, which are generally affiliated with these larger metropolitan counterparts, the audience coverage in 2014 was, for the Prime network, 24.33 per cent; WIN Network, 25.15 per cent; and Southern Cross, 34.11 per cent. Tasmania, my home state, is covered by the WIN Network and Southern Cross, which I have to say do an excellent job of providing very relevant local content in their news bulletins and other programming as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rule has the practical effect of preventing mergers between any of the metropolitan networks, being Seven, Nine or Ten, and any of the regional networks, being Prime, WIN and Southern Cross. Any merger under the current arrangements would substantially exceed the 75 per cent rule, and the rule as it stands does little to support media diversity, as regional viewers—those who live outside of our metropolitan areas—essentially receive the same commercial TV programming as their metropolitan brothers and sisters due to the affiliation or content supply agreements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the changing media landscape, with broadband internet and the proliferation of tablets, smartphones and other devices, the rule is largely redundant. The ABC and SBS now are streaming their channels online to 100 per cent of the population, if they choose to access it, right across the country, including into regional markets where metropolitan networks don't currently broadcast other than through affiliates. The repeal of this rule would remove one burden on broadcasters, allowing consolidation and change in affiliation and ownerships, making such changes to relevant competition laws, as with most other industries. It would provide broadcasters the opportunity to build operations on a greater scale and compete in an environment where audiences can already access premium content online. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going to the two-out-of-three cross-media rule, the rule provides that mergers can't involve more than two of the three regulated platforms of TV, radio and newspapers in any commercial radio licence area. This rule tightly regulates just TV, radio and newspapers and doesn't take into consideration the changing media landscape and the substantial online media offerings we have today, including the alternative news sources that exist. We're also seeing traditional providers now moving into these more modern platforms. A lot of our newspapers run things through social media newsfeeds and the like. They are doing their best under the current arrangements to compete, but it is important that we do support this legislation to give a truly level playing field. This rule is not suited to a contemporary media environment and it does restrict the diversity of content offered to consumers. It was introduced in 2006, which is 11 years ago, and we have to reflect on the technology we had back then versus the technology we have now. Smartphones, tablets et cetera were all in very juvenile stages of development and not as widely available to every man, woman and child as they are today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three rules to remain. Firstly, the five-four rule applies to TV and radio and is known as the minimum voices rule. It is a requirement that at least five independent media operations or media groups are present in mainland state capital cities, and at least four must be present in regional commercial radio licence areas. Secondly, the one-to-a-market rule specifies that a person must not control more than one commercial TV broadcasting licence in a licence area. Finally, the two-to-a-market rule specifies that a person must not control more than two commercial radio broadcasting licences in the same licence area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to also point out that these specific broadcasting requirements, mergers and acquisitions in the media sector are subject to the general prohibition of anticompetitive acquisitions outlined in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. So we can see that this sector is highly regulated—there are rules everywhere. The point is that these rules are to remain dynamic, to remain relevant and to foster growth in this area, to ensure that our media industry is operating at optimum levels in a competitive way, ensuring that all audiences—regional and metropolitan—get the content they are after. The operating environment for free-to-air commercial TV and radio broadcasters has changed substantially and is expected to continue to do so over the next five to 10 years, and I suspect well beyond that as well. The current rules on control and ownership constrain the ability of Australian media outlets to change the structure of their businesses and to respond to changes in the media environment. That's not okay in 2017. The sad reality is that that does have an impact on jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining to me, I will briefly turn to the matter of regional content, which is an important issue; it is close to my heart. As I said before, Tasmania is almost entirely a regional community, perhaps with the exception of Hobart. Online media services do provide a useful product for consumers, but they are no substitute for local broadcasters. Australia is a very vast country, with many, many diverse and disparate communities across its land, and Tasmania is no exception to that. We are small geographically, but we are broken up into many subregions: the north-west; the west coast, which is an entirely different community with different news needs and different activities taking place; the north-east, which is within a couple of hundred kilometres of the population centre of Launceston but, again, a very different community with different needs when it comes to news and current affairs; and then, heading south, within the Hobart region, there is the Derwent Valley, the Huon Valley, the south-east and the east coast. All these areas have their own unique communities and a requirement for specific news in each of those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The local broadcasters that we have—be it our TV broadcasters in Southern Cross, WIN or indeed the government broadcasters, being the ABC predominantly, and also the radio networks and print media—do a great job of providing tailored local content, which is so important for local communities. Indeed, in times of natural disaster and emergencies, it is the local TV and radio that really do assist these small communities. Again, being close to one another doesn't mean they are the same communities. The Derwent Valley, a half-hour to 40-minute drive from Hobart, may be subject to emergency warnings that Hobart is not. That's why it's important that we do have regional content available through our local broadcasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, local programming supports much-needed jobs in regional communities. This is also through advertising through our commercial broadcasters. It's amazing when travelling around the state of Tasmania—going into any workplace and hearing the local radio station blaring in the workshop, bakery or news agency. Local businesses advertise on local radio. It provides local jobs; it supports local jobs. That's why it's important. Local programming may be at risk where regional broadcasters merge operations and there are strong expectations of cost savings. You end up with syndicated content, which is not good because that is not what these small local communities are after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was disappointing to reflect on one of the iterations of the committee report a Senate inquiry has done into this legislation and note the dissenting comments of opposition and Greens senators to this, because it really shows that they don't have an understanding of what regional communities require when it comes to media, when it comes to local content and, indeed, as I've just demonstrated, when it comes to local jobs. I think it is incumbent upon senators in this place—opposition, Greens and anyone else—to support the measures contained in this bill: to support the Australian media to catch up with the 21st century, to ensure we have the best regulatory regime that we possibly can and, most importantly, to support regional communities and regional content and those who produce it to make sure our regional communities are not left out because of the inner-city Labor and Green people in this place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent more than 55 years as a working journo before I 'jumped the shark', as they say, and ended up at this place. I worked in all forms of media: newspapers, magazines, radio, television and online media websites. I have been a cub reporter, a foreign correspondent, a Sydney newspaper editor, a TV current affairs host on free-to-air and pay TV, a radio current affairs host and an internet website blogger. Let me give the Labor Party media experts and some crossbenchers some personal statistics—and not the one about being sacked 16 times!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I started out as a cadet reporter on a small town daily newspaper across the ditch in New Zealand—<span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Tarana</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ki Herald</span>, circulation 11,000. It was the oldest daily newspaper in New Zealand. It started in 1852. I say 'was' because it closed in 1989. I then worked on the Christchurch<span style="font-style:italic;"> Star</span>. It was first published in 1868, and it stopped publishing in 1991. I then worked for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Waikato</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> in Hamilton, New Zealand. It started in 1872 and six years ago changed from being an afternoon paper to a morning paper. It's really struggling now, having just been bought by Fairfax. Speaking of Fairfax, I crossed the ditch on the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Wanganella</span> in 1963 and got a job as a police reporter on the Sydney <span style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span>. I worked there for several years before going to New York as a foreign correspondent and returned in 1975 to become editor in 1976.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sydney <span style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span> no longer exists. Neither does our bitter rival, Rupert Murdoch's <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror</span>. All those papers have gone. All have closed down. This is the media fact that I want to ram home. They couldn't all have closed down just because I worked on them! The Fairfax papers, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span>, are being circled by bottom-feeding sharks. Their print editions could cease any time—maybe even by the end of this year. That New York landmark the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>was<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>immortalised in <span style="font-style:italic;">Guys and Dolls</span>—'What's in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span>? I'll tell you what's in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span>.' I'll tell you what's in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span>. It was sold to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> last week for $1.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the <span style="font-style:italic;">HINCH </span>program on the Ten Network. That network has been in receivership and has now been sold—it hasn't gone through yet. It has been bought by CBS, a foreign corporation. That's why I ask: are you getting the drift? Are the senators getting the drift? That is why I say to any crossbenchers who oppose the relaxation of draconian, Neanderthal, out-of-date media laws—including the two-out-of-three rule and including the 75 per cent reach—that you have rocks in your head, and the Labor Party, too. Labor's shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, has said that the planned relaxation of the laws 'threatens media diversity'. She said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor opposes removing the two out of three rule because it would achieve very little at potentially great cost - further media consolidation and a reduction in the diversity of voices across the media landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the two-out-of-three rule prevents media companies from owning a TV network, a radio station and a newspaper in the same market. That's what they're perpetuating. Ms Rowland also said that Labor does believe that the pragmatic course of action—one of them—at this time is to repeal the 75 per cent reach rule, and that is good news. She said that this would ensure that local content is bolstered following a trigger event and provide immediate licence fee relief to the commercial broadcasters. But her claim that removing the two-out-of-three rule threatens media diversity is patently wrong—Noddy Land! If we do nothing, if we play ostrich here in this house, with our heads in the sand, that is what will threaten media diversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the days when the morning paper, especially on Wednesdays and Saturdays, weighed a tonne. Those were the days of the fabulous rivers of gold from classified advertising that made the fortunes of the Packers, the Fairfaxes and the Murdochs. But I believe that the shift of audience—and, more importantly, the advertising—to multinational giants, such as Google and Facebook, with all their tax dodging as well, threatens the very existence of newspapers and the viability of free-to-air and subscription television.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scrapping the two-out-of-three rule will allow Australian media companies to compete on a more level playing field with global challenges. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, said that the sale of the Ten Network to CBS actually showed that change to the media laws are no longer necessary. Well, in my view, the sale of Channel Ten to CBS means an even more urgent need for a review of media laws. The way it stands at the moment, the way it stood when CBS got in and ambushed Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon—but leaving them out of it for a minute—no other Australians could have a level playing field and a chance to compete against CBS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe all of this should have happened years ago. And I agreed with communications minister Mitch Fifield when he said awhile back that a few facts have escaped some of the knockers in the other place and in the Senate. He said that, No. 1, Kylie Minogue does not live on Ramsay Street anymore, and, No. 2, the internet does exist. He said that it is very important that our media laws reflect the second of these facts. Consider this: people no longer rush home to watch the six o'clock news—or shall I say, immodestly, the old <span style="font-style:italic;">Hinch </span><span style="font-style:italic;">at Seven</span>. News now is 24/7. The current laws, the deliberately restrictive laws, were brought in years ago, long before we had pay TV, before the internet, before smartphones, before podcasts, before website editorials and before online newspapers—some of them, of course, behind paywalls. I must admit that my advice to Rupert Murdoch, as an ex metropolitan newspaper editor, was that he should never have posted anything on the website for free, because if you then start charging for stories people won't want to pay for them. Well, that's another story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back finally to this media package: as a former newspaper editor, as an old journo with more than 50 years of experience in the game, let me warn you that I have never known the Australian media to be under such a threat. Some will sink; that is true. Some will thrive. New platforms will appear that we have never even dreamed of. I, for one, want that diverse media freedom to grow and flourish around the country, in metropolitan areas and in the regions. And I say that today because I'm not going to just sit back and say, as somebody once said, 'That's life; good night'!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DYU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 forms part of a comprehensive package of reforms that have been put forward by the Turnbull government, announced in May this year, and it's aimed at sustaining, among a number of things, the free-to-air broadcasting sector. The other part of the package is the Commercial Broadcasting (Tax) Bill 2017, otherwise known as the tax bill. There are a number of components to the bill and I will run through those before I talk about some of the details and some of the reasons these reforms are important in today's media environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill comprises a number of measures—firstly, it aims to reform the outdated media regulation in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to better reflect the contemporary digital media environment, and that goes to the 75 per cent audience reach provision and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. As a few previous speakers have identified, the digital environment and where Australians are turning to to source their media, whether that be for entertainment or more particularly for news and current affairs, has led to a substantial change in the dynamics of the community. I will come back to address that in a little more detail. The bill will also amend and introduce some additional local programming obligations under the act for regional commercial television broadcasting licences because, at the moment, their licences can become part of a group commercial television licence, and there can be a change of control with the area affected by that exceeding the current 75 per cent rule. We are looking to amend the antisiphoning scheme under the act and the antisiphoning notice, and I will mention some of the key sporting events that people would be concerned about here in Australia in articulating what those changes may actually mean. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation looks to permanently abolish annual television and radio licence fees and datacasting charges payable by commercial providers, and again you've got to keep this in the context of all of the overheads associated with establishing a broadcast facility, perhaps a local radio station. I think of Flow FM, based in Kapunda, that broadcasts to a network of country communities across South Australia. They do that at some considerable cost, compared to somebody who streams information on the internet and whose set-up and ongoing costs are really low. If we're keen to keep the free-to-air broadcast type of service going, we need to make sure these broadcasters remain competitive. Certainly people in the digital space don't have the same kind of licensing and regulatory fees that people in the broadcast area do, and so, given those people in the broadcast area have to wear these overhead costs, we need to make sure that they are competitive in terms of their cost base. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People tend to think of news or entertainment or talkback radio shows as being the sorts of things that free-to-air broadcasting provides, but free-to-air radio plays an important role in emergency management in this nation. Sometimes after significant events, whether they be floods or fires, the post-disaster analysis is done formally—for example, in Queensland after the floods in 2015—and at other times it's done as a result of community-led efforts, particularly after bushfires. Whatever the case is, people look at the infrastructure that has failed—and one of the areas that sometimes fails is communications. That might be because exchanges or the connecting lines that transmit data are burnt, or perhaps because the power has failed and there is no backup at the exchange or the mobile phone tower. So the communications often fail. Sometimes it's even just congestion; so many people are trying to use the network. One of the key measures for getting information to people about the often rapid development of natural disasters is free-to-air radio, and so it's really important that, for regional communities in particular, we have a sustainable base for those services so that they can be providing that information to communities who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another whole debate around analysing post-disaster activity to work out where the failure modes are within our communication system. I note there have been calls recently for all mobile phone towers to have backup batteries, for example, that exceed the capacity of their existing ones. Whilst I welcome the intent behind that, I merely point out that the loss of battery backup power is but one failure mode that can cause a breakdown in communication for a community in a given region. You might double the size and go from half a day to even two days, but when we look at some of the events that have occurred there have been multiple days without mains power. So the processes, for example, that Telstra has in place already, where it can provide either a complete mobile phone tower facility to replace a tower that has been damaged or burnt, or it can provide a generator—they have in recent events even flown in generators by helicopter to keep things like mobile phone towers operating—we see that there is a real role in national disaster resilience planning for all three levels of government to work together. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was speaking yesterday in fact with Minister Keenan about some of the funding they've announced in South Australia, along with Minister Malinauskas there, for both community groups and organisations that are seeking to plug some of those gaps. It's an important measure to make sure we have communications available. I'd certainly be encouraging communities and also local government to be reaching out and seeing what services are already provided. In particular the Attorney-General's Department underpins some of the priority communication services that allow firefighters and first responders to have priority access through telephone networks. They can link in, at a very nominal cost to them, to some of those supports provided by the federal government, but also that resilience planning to work out ahead of time with communications network providers such as Telstra as to where the likely failure modes are and where the responses will be needed, so that, as the disaster progresses—particularly things like bushfires—we can put in place the appropriate measures. But right upfront one of those key ones is free-to-air radio. My message to people in rural communities is, 'Get involved with that planning at a community and local government level, but make sure you have a radio with batteries available to be listening to those warnings, because it's an important part.' It's a bit of an aside to this broadcasting amendment, but it just highlights one of the critical life-saving needs for free-to-air broadcasts into our regional communities in particular. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as abolishing the fees, the legislation also looks to remove the taxes on the equipment used by commercial broadcasters, establish tax collection and assessment arrangements for the new interim transmitter licence tax and establish a statutory review of the new tax arrangements in 2021 consistent with a broad review of spectrum pricing which is underway. It establishes a transitional support payment scheme for 19 commercial broadcasters to make sure no broadcaster will be worse off during this transitional period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I come back to some of those digital things, I want to touch on the concept of spectrum again. People often wonder why we make so much fuss about spectrum. Coming from a defence background and chairing the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, what we see increasingly is that not only in the conduct of our day-to-day life but also in our banking, our national security and a whole range of areas, spectrum is an incredibly important issue that we need to be aware of. Not only is the allocation of spectrum important but also the price signals we send in terms of who can access and use that spectrum. In this case here, people are looking at how that spectrum should be priced, and I just want to make the point that it's not a free good. Every time you give up some spectrum that can be used in one area, you potentially limit the availability of that spectrum to be used for something that we think is critical. For example, in the national defence space, whether that be telemetry of data around aircraft and missile systems, whether that be communications systems, be it commercial or defence and government related, spectrum is not a free good. There is a finite allocation that can be made. These reviews need to take into account not only the commercial availability of spectrum to media broadcasters but also the broader considerations that government has. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first reform looks at responding to the contemporary digital media environment, and it looks at repealing some of the outdated media ownership and control laws, such as the 75 per cent audience reach or the two-out-of-three cross-control rule. What opponents of that ignore is that many people now almost solely access their entertainment, their social contact and, more frequently now, their current affairs and news information through social media platforms that are internet based. Whether it's Facebook, Google or whatever site you want to use, there are providers reaching far more than 75 per cent of a population. That is changing, fundamentally, the dynamics in our marketplace. In some ways, that is good; it means that people can at very low cost access information or entertainment across a broad range of areas where, perhaps, a broadcaster previously didn't have the licence to distribute particular information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also really negative aspects to it, which is why it's important that we make sure these alternative voices remain commercially viable into the future. What I'm talking about there is what is increasingly being known as the echo effect of social media. In the United States, the Brookings Institution, for example, has had a look at what President Obama did through his campaigns, and, more recently, at what President Trump did in his campaign. Demos, a cross-party think tank in the UK, has looked at the impact of social media and this echo effect in the UK in their most recent election. What has become increasingly apparent is that in the day of social media, where people are becoming connected predominantly through networks of like-minded people, the algorithms used by corporations such as Facebook and Google are looking at your preferences and then feeding news to you and directing you to news sites or articles that reflect your point of view. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can see, for advertisers, why that kind of thing is appealing. If somebody does a Google search for, say, red hats, to then be able to present that person with information about people who are designing or selling red hats is really good marketing. It is very clever. A lot of Australians would be shocked to realise how much of their personal lives, preferences and habits—even where they travel—are actually known to corporations like Google and Facebook through the collection of data from their internet searches. There is the reporting back from things like Google Maps. It will predict, the next time you hop in the car, where you are about to go on a Sunday afternoon. I've noticed that on my own iPhone. When I turn it on, it pops up and guesses where I'm going to go, because it's obviously been tracking for some time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's fine, in some senses, from a commercial perspective. But the concern raised by Demos and the Brookings Institution is that where people only access news from a particular news source that already supports their perception, it actually reinforces their bias. So whilst it may be a valid perspective, it's really important—if our polity is to continue to work as a functioning liberal plural democracy—that the plurality of views is recognised and valued. One of the problems is, if you have a cohort who merely access their information from a subset of news streams that informs them from a particular perspective, they start to believe—this is what the studies are showing—that anyone who doesn't see the world through their own prism is not a reasonable person, that that person doesn't have well-founded or well-meaning interpretations of what's happening in the world. We see that in some of the current debates where people are being called racists, bigots and other things because they have a different view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen in the UK around Brexit and parties like UKIP and in the United States around the Trump campaign is that there is an increasing division between groups in communities. There have been some quite fascinating papers written about why people who sit in one camp can look at another and go: 'Why is that person unable to actually see and appreciate my perspective? Why are they so wrong and stuck in their views?' 'The studies are pointing to the fact that this digital divide in our community, this echo-chamber effect, means that people aren't being challenged on a regular basis to recognise that there are other valid views around the same topic and that one set of facts can have a number of interpretations and can have a number of quite reasonable differences between people in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ability to have broadsheet newspapers, television broadcasters, broadcasting news and free-to-air radio that people will either deliberately or even accidentally interact with provides an alternate perspective to what they may have been fed through their Facebook feed or other feeds through digital media. That's really important for the actual continuation of a successful plural society where a diversity of views actually makes us stronger, as opposed to having everybody just believing that their point of view is the only right point of view and that, if you don't hold their point of view, you must somehow be morally bankrupt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions around media ownership are far from decreasing the number of voices. What they're trying to do is make alternate voices commercially sustainable. That's because, if these other providers aren't out there and the echo effect continues, we will get to the point where the only voice that people will interact with, unless they very deliberately make an effort to escape the algorithms of Facebook, Google and others who feed them information, will be these free-to-air-type broadcasters. It's important that those voices are commercially sustainable so that, in years to come, they will still be here in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just very quickly, there are some other areas of Australian content that I think are important. Again, it comes back, in part, to this culture. We're being told constantly that we are part of a global community, and that's all great, except for the fact that not all cultures are the same and not all communities are the same. Whilst it's wonderful to see what other countries are doing, it's really important, also, that we celebrate what is uniquely Australian, particularly by having our young people exposed to views of Australian life and Australian attitudes so that they actually grow up having an understanding of what it means to be an Australian, as opposed to somebody living in the suburbs of an American sitcom and all the things that go along with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review that was announced in May, for example, looking at both Australian children's content production and distribution incentives combined with audience demand to find ways to actually help Australian content to be delivered and be successful is really important. In South Australia, for example, <span style="font-style:italic;">McLeod's Daughters</span> was a very famous and successful series for a number of years. The town of Freeling where that was produced was actually in my electorate of Wakefield when I was a member in the other place, and it was not only a source of local work in South Australia but also provided a great tourist opportunity for businesses in Freeling with people constantly wanting to come through to see the pub, the sets and everything that happened in Freeling. But, importantly, it also gave a glimpse into, albeit a dramatised view, Australian life. It was an Australian situation, as opposed to a situation somewhere in downtown New York in an American sitcom.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, the creator of <span style="font-style:italic;">McLeod's Daughter</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>, Ms Graeme-Evans, wrote another script for a new miniseries. Channel 9 is looking at potentially supporting that but hasn't committed. The kinds of incentives that we're looking for—the media ownership rules that we're looking for and the relaxation of things like fees to make it more commercially viable—are the sorts of things we need to encourage people like Channel 9 to actually commit and say, 'Yes, we'll get behind a new miniseries of <span style="font-style:italic;">McLeod's Daughters</span>.' There was actually quite a significant financial impact for the community in South Australia from the production of that series, and that could happen again. So these media reforms are welcomed for the long-term benefit of our broadcasters and the long-term benefit of our society by having a range of voices and Australian content to inform all Australians of the future of our nation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  A review of Australia's media environment is long overdue. Our current broadcasting and media ownership laws have been overtaken by the commercial realities of the digital age and are now serving to undermine, rather than underpin, a strong Australian media. Traditional media businesses are haemorrhaging profits. The once rivers of advertising gold have become a trickle, with online giants such as Google and Facebook now taking the majority share. With limited revenue from their digital pursuits, media organisations that are keeping their heads above water are doing so through ongoing cost cutting, by selling off assets or by tapping into shareholders that have very deep pockets. But, as we saw with the Ten Network, deep pockets can't be relied on indefinitely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ironically, to save itself, the industry is eroding its core product. It is trying to do more with less, with varying degrees of success. Nowhere is this pressure more evident than in the newsrooms of our free-to-air broadcasters, daily newspapers and commercial radio stations. In the past few years we have seen wave after wave of redundancies across print and broadcast media. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance estimates that since 2011 an estimated 2,500 journalists, photographers and subeditors have taken a package and left the industry. Most of these were seasoned staff with a wealth of skill and contacts. Their loss represents a loss of knowledge and depth for newsrooms across the country. Their loss is a collective hit to broad-ranging, hard news, serious investigative journalism and intelligent, objective analysis, as opposed to opinion, which is flourishing in its place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, no-one in this place wants to see the industry depleted any further than it has been. That is why this bill and the debate is so important. For politicians there are many occasions when we don't like what we read, hear or see in the news, particularly about ourselves, but we all accept that a robust, independent and free press is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy. Anyone who believes otherwise is very much deluding themselves. And anyone who thinks that mainstream media can survive and deliver quality and insightful news—as opposed to dumbed down, populist clickbait—without urgent legislative intervention is suffering an acute case of blind optimism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Newsrooms are already using online clicks to determine what gets priority on their online sites. This is not a healthy trend. We already have enough stories about the Instagram photo Kim regrets most or the 12 practical uses of avocado oil that will blow your mind. Civic journalism needs to be safeguarded. We need a thriving media to bring important news, no matter how boring it might be, to a good chunk of its audience. We need to loosen the straitjacket that once served to protect diversity but now serves to shackle the industry to outdated operating models. We need to rein in the uncompetitive advantages that global internet giants, such as Facebook and Google, are exploiting. At the moment, these market-distorting digital dominators are appropriating unique, Australian-made content and profiting from it while also enjoying the lion's share of advertising revenue. They need to pay a fair price for unique content that is not their own.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If media organisations stop producing unique content, where does that leave the likes of Apple News and Facebook? They will probably have to put their hands in their own pockets to pay people to make shareable news and entertainment content, and that is way more expensive than pilfering it for free or for below-market rates. Their market-distorting powers are such that 2,000 news organisations in the US and Canada recently banded together to seek permission to negotiate collectively with Google and Facebook. What they want is simply to have a fairer share of the revenue and customer data that these giants collect in return for using their journalism. The Nick Xenophon Team agrees wholeheartedly with the industry that these online giants need to be called into account. That is why I and my NXT colleagues have pushed very hard for an ACCC inquiry that will lay bare, for once and for all, the tactics and conditions that search engines and social media platforms have imposed on Australian media organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have in-principle support from the government for an inquiry by the competition watchdog that will probe into the impact of these platforms on the media and advertising landscape and determine whether their practices impede media organisations from recouping their own costs. We hope that the government will proceed with the ACCC inquiry, regardless of the outcome of this bill, as it will be a very important tool for levelling the playing field and, ideally, making these digital giants pay their fair share for the valued content made by others. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anecdotally, these digital platforms have media organisations over a barrel. The media businesses I have spoken to don't like the terms they are forced to accept. They receive very little, if any, benefits from them but feel very much powerless to challenge them. These obligations and conditions will now finally be weighed by the competition watchdog, and, unlike media and other third-party organisations, the ACCC actually has the power to address any uncompetitive behaviour it finds. I do hope these digital platforms are, in a way, sweating over this prospect. Their days of somewhat ripping off media organisations and disingenuously claiming that it's all fair play in an open market are hopefully very much numbered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting fair compensation for the use of their content will assist the traditional media business model in an environment where they are fighting for every advertising dollar. According to figures in ACMA's most recent communications report, print media has been capturing less and less of the national advertising dollar. It attracted $5.3 billion in advertising revenue in 2011, but this collapsed to $2.3 billion by 2015 as more and more advertisers shifted away from traditional platforms in favour of digital. Digital advertising now accounts for almost half of the Australian advertising market. According to the Commercial Economic Advisory Service of Australia, online ad share grew by six percentage points last year to make up almost 49 per cent of the total Australian advertising market. This came partly at the expense of traditional media. For instance, the advertising spend on free-to-air television dropped by 21 per cent last year from 24 per cent the previous year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The digital advertising sector is getting stronger and stronger. According to IAB Australia, the total online advertising spend grew to a whopping $7.4 billion last year, up a substantial 23 per cent on 2015. But this has proven to be a double whammy for media organisations not only because it's such a competitive space but also because the returns generated from online advertising are generally lower. Interestingly, the ABC is contributing in a small but arguably unnecessary way to this struggle. It spent $1.5 million last year on digital marketing to push its editorial content through social media and on search engines. Given the public broadcaster's main website is already ranked amongst the top sites in Australia, we question whether the public broadcaster should be using its scarce resources to essentially compete against commercial news sites. It is clear that action needs to be taken. Australian media companies cannot produce quality content with dwindling resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also particularly pleased that the government listened to us and industry and has scrapped licence fees for commercial television broadcasters and radio broadcasters. Licence fees were becomingly increasingly burdensome at a time when falling network advertising revenues has forced broadcasters to make difficult decisions about how to fund their operations. They were also increasingly unfair with commercial free-to-air broadcasters paying around $127 million a year in licence fees whilst their digital competitors paid absolutely nothing. The licence fees will be replaced with an interim transmitter tax regime, which will be levied to reflect spectrum use. It will not end the disparity with digital providers, but it will at least cost commercial free-to-air broadcasters less—about a third of what they are collectively paying now. They are very much the positives in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In turning to the rest of the bill, I acknowledge that there have been concerns by some in this place and in the community that scrapping our media control laws may harm diversity. In reality, the greater threat to diversity is the industry's steady erosion. We need to remember that the current rules were drafted for the analog era, and that time is forever gone. Our world has dramatically altered. Ongoing dynamic change in the media landscape is our new reality and there is no use pretending that laws made 25 years ago are still relevant today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 came into being, it would still be another four years before Google would surface as a PhD research project and 12 years before Facebook would come onto the scene. It was a time when most people only watched free-to-air television, listened to radio and read the daily newspapers. There were no podcasts, no on-demand content streaming, no online news sites, no social media, and advertisers flocked, in a big way, to mainstream media. The laws drafted then did not unfairly restrict competition or prevent media organisations from succeeding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These laws no longer reflect the reality we all operate in, which is one where the internet is effectively the fourth unregulated media player. The net covers 100 per cent of the country, 100 per cent of the time, and makes a mockery of the 75 per cent audience coverage rule. The 75 per cent reach rule threshold came into force in 1993 and was established to prevent metropolitan commercial stations from merging with or buying the regional networks Prime, WIN or Southern Cross, thus having blanket coverage across Australia. However, affiliation agreements between the major and regional networks mean that, in practice, almost identical programming extends across metro and regional areas. Ten, Nine and Seven also allow viewers to stream much of their content for free, and let's not forget that pay television providers are at liberty to broadcast their content across the entire country without any similar restrictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The two-out-of-three rule is especially redundant considering consumers are no longer stuck with whatever their newspaper, local television station and radio stations decide to offer. There are no borders or barriers. You can find pretty well any kind of information you need, seek out whatever opinion resonates with you and stream or download a wide variety of entertainment, as long as it is legal and your internet plan allows it. In the end, it all comes down to choice, your choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every major commercial broadcaster and publisher has an online presence, and whilst the majority of Australian online news services are still owned by the dominant players—namely, News Corp and Fairfax—there are plenty of alternatives out there. You can go straight to the source often on Twitter. There are citizen bloggers and eyewitness accounts in real time. There are a number of new players not associated with the majors, such as BuzzFeed, The Conversation, Junkee, or InDaily in my home state of South Australia and its affiliate The New Daily in Victoria. So consumers have no shortage of options, irrespective of the mainstream media licences covering their area. By the same token, the two-out-of-three ownership law was designed to protect media diversity by preventing ownership of more than two of the traditional regulated media platforms—namely, newspapers, commercial radio and commercial television—in the same market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the argument that it now risks inhibiting the ability of media companies to restructure or find economies of scale that will enable them to survive and hopefully thrive. However, we cannot simply repeal this rule and walk away. The so-called minimum voices test will maintain the diversity floor, and it is worth pointing out that the ACCC has oversight of mergers to ensure there is no detrimental market impact. Section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act prevents mergers that are likely to substantially lessen competition. Even so, we can still be more proactive about protecting what we value. We can help protect diversity by taking some of the financial pressures off smaller players in order to help them thrive. We will keep negotiating with the government in good faith in order to achieve this aim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, what we don't want is for the current laws to assist in the slow death of Australian news media. We need to act to provide Australian media with a more level playing field and a legislative environment that is more responsive to the modern operating landscape. If we don't, we may eventually be left consuming little more than mindless clickbait and fake news with our morning cornflakes or smashed avocado. My NXT colleagues and I agree it is time to substantially reform our existing media laws. This bill makes a sound start, but we believe that there is more that can be done and we reserve our final position for now.</span>

                    <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I too rise to commend and applaud the Turnbull government on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. Before I get into the reasons why I particularly support this bill, I would like to commend the speakers who have just preceded me, in particular Senator Hinch. There is no-one in this chamber, and very few people in this nation, who have more experience in more platforms of the Australian media landscape than the human headline, our wonderful Senator Derryn Hinch. I think he made a very compelling case as to why this legislation is so necessary. He said himself, just now in this chamber, that he's never known the Australian media to be under such threat. In his own inimitable way he also said that you have to have rocks in your head to actually oppose these reforms. He very clearly, and I think very cogently, destroyed the ALP's claim that these changes will restrict diversity. As he said, it is patently wrong. In fact, Senator Hinch also argued, again very cogently, that not supporting these changes in this bill will actually further restrict the media. Those who believe otherwise, he said, are in Noddy Land. I could not agree more with what Senator Hinch just said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to congratulate Senator Griff on his comments just now in the chamber. Again, Senator Griff put a very cogent, clear argument as to why media reform is necessary, and I would like to thank him for his very considered words. He pointed out very clearly the unfairness that has now arisen in relation to legislation that was drafted in 1993 in a very analog world. Today it is distorting the market to such a degree that those who operate in the digital world have a great advantage over the traditional media, which is so important, as Senator Fawcett said, in regional Australia. As Senator Fawcett also said—and I congratulate him for making these points in relation to confirmation bias—all Australians need to have as much diversity as possible in the information that they see and hear through all the various platforms of communication, rather than just the one point of view, to avoid the echo chamber that Senator Fawcett mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that, in our Australian society, media outlets continue to play a crucial role in reflecting and representing our culture and providing information to our local communities, and they are, ultimately, critically important to our democratic processes. As the former chair of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee I heard very compelling evidence in the inquiry on this legislation. That inquiry left me in absolutely no doubt that broadcasters and publishers are operating in an increasingly challenging environment, with intense competition for audiences and advertising revenue and also from other media companies, including the ABC, which, I believe, has a distorting impact on the ability of commercial broadcast media to make a profit and be competitive in this current environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To pick up Senator Hinch's words, I think anybody in this place that does not see Network Ten's announcement of voluntary administration in June this year as a concern is in Noddy Land. It is indicative of the current instability and the obstacles that are hindering the performance of our traditional broadcasters. They are hamstrung by analog-era legislation which digital media are clearly not subject to. This bill provides the necessary and appropriate reforms to ensure that our media outlets are equipped and the regulatory framework in which they operate is appropriate for today and also for tomorrow's media environment. There are many new challenges, and it is outrageous that we are hamstringing these organisations to the point where some are going into voluntary administration or, as Senator Hinch said, have simply closed their doors, reducing diversity. This bill provides the necessary and appropriate reforms to ensure that our media outlets are equipped with the regulatory framework that they need to survive in a digital world, and not only survive but, hopefully, prosper. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly to the Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which I spoke to yesterday in this chamber, the bill before us, in many of its amendments, seeks to modernise aspects of an act which is severely out of date and is now having many contrary impacts on our democracy. In terms of the Electoral Act, it was in relation to the types of communications we receive on electoral matters, in campaigns. In this case, if we don't change, if we don't update our laws so that all of our media outlets, no matter what and how they broadcast, are able to do so, our democracy will be the poorer, because people simply will not be getting the information they need to make informed choices and to be getting alternative points of view, as Senator Fawcett so eloquently pointed out in his speech on this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the minister on his stakeholder and industry engagement and on gaining unanimous support from all sectors of the media industry, many of which consider this media reform package and this bill as vital to their longevity and their viability. Again, if the Channel 10 insolvency doesn't sound alarm bells for those opposite, I don't know what will. Let me share with the chamber some of the comments by industry. First of all, Network Ten CEO Paul Anderson stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… it is blindingly obvious that these pre-internet era laws are now achieving the opposite of what they were intended to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1993. He went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They are now working against a strong, viable and diverse media sector, and they must go. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Primarily straight into rural and regional households through digital communication platforms that are not subject to the same rules as some of the other longstanding organisations. Free TV Australia has said unequivocally that the government's media reform package is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEO of Prime Media Group, Mr Ian Audsley, said that this bill is critical to retaining regional broadcasting jobs and:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has been a lot of talk about the threat to diversity if the two-out-of-three rule is repealed. We would argue that there is greater threat to media diversity if the media reform bill is not passed …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Which is exactly what Senator Hinch has just told this chamber, with all of his years of experience—that there is a greater threat to media diversity if these bills are not passed, because the risk is that even more journalists will lose their jobs in regional Australia, more newsrooms will be forced to scale down and, in a worst-case scenario, some businesses will close. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will provide the Australian media industry and sector stakeholders with the necessary stability, assurance and support to embrace the modern media environment, the digital media environment, which this act never even conceived of back in 1993. Free-to-air broadcasters play a vital role in providing access to high-quality Australian content. What do they provide? They provide current affairs, sport, drama and children's programs to all Australians, all over this nation. However, as we all know and many speakers here have said, the broadcasters are operating in a very different environment, against increasingly competitive and challenging circumstances, due to the entry of online service providers, who are simply not subject to the same rules and restrictions as the broadcasters are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although Australian audiences have viewing opportunities across many platforms, I'm sure over the next few years there will be many more platforms to come. To make sure that the Australian industry remains competitive, the Senate must pass this bill. We can no longer shackle traditional media outlets with laws that do not apply to the new organisations and those that will come in the future. It is a fact that, if passed, the majority of broadcasters will be better off. Although it may take time for businesses to transition to the proposed new fee model, the minister has made it clear that a transitional support package will be available. The support package will ensure broadcasters are no worse off as a result of these changes in the bill. In turn—and importantly for broadcasters—it will provide them with certainty for the next five years that their fees will not increase. This is a very responsible thing to do, and it is yet another example of this government taking responsible actions and making responsible decisions that are in the interests of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the government's media reform package, this bill will modernise regulation and help position the industry as a sector to deal with existing and future challenges and changes in communication platforms. This bill will not only ensure that the act is relevant today; it will also ensure that the operation of the act does not hold industry back or impose regulations that are no longer relevant or applicable—the time came and went for the current legislation many, many years ago. The minister lamented that the regulations governing our media companies do not allow them to meet the challenges on a level playing field, as a result of the increase in online, on-demand operators and the many foreign technology companies that now operate here in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, as the chair of the environment and communications committee—which looked in detail at this legislation and heard evidence from many different sectors in this industry—I firmly believe this bill, with the reform package that was announced in May this year, provides a sensible suite of measures. The package provides the necessary reforms to modernise media regulation and to position the Australian media industry to deal with existing and future challenges more effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first—and probably one of the most significant—reform that this bill will introduce is the repealing of the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. As you've heard from senators on the crossbench and on the government side, these rules are completely and utterly out of date. They are distorting and killing some of our regional TV stations and other broadcast media. They were written in 1993. As Senator Hinch said, we are no longer in a world where Kylie Minogue lives on Ramsay Street, among many other things—for example, 1993 was the year Meatloaf released his song 'I'd Do Anything for Love' and, given his recent performances, he'd probably have done better to stay with that song in 1993. But that is the world that this legislation was introduced to regulate—an analog world, which no longer exists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This 75 per cent audience reach rule is a classic example of why this bill is required. It prohibits a person, either in their own right or as a director of one or more companies, from being in a position to exercise control of commercial TV broadcasting licences whose combined reach exceeds 75 per cent of the Australian population. This rule is clearly redundant and, as has been said by Senator Hinch and Senator Griff, is grossly distorting, particularly on rural and regional media. It doesn't protect diversity anymore. In fact, it is doing quite the opposite; it is further restricting media diversity, and it has to change. Audiences across the country today receive essentially the same broadcast content due to affiliation agreements between metropolitan and regional networks, and all three metropolitan TV broadcasters and the ABC stream some or all of their channels online to 100 per cent of the population. This rule takes into account none of that. It is an outdated analogue-era requirement. It takes into account none of the digital access to news, stories, programs and children's entertainment that most Australians now have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing that this bill does which I think is very important is amend local programming obligations to introduce additional obligations for regional broadcasters. This bill includes a welcome range of measures to ensure the availability of local content in regional areas and strengthens links between local content and the communities it is broadcast to. In the absence of such regulation, the high cost of local content production and structural changes underway in the media more broadly will create further incentives for broadcasters to achieve efficiencies, placing even further pressure on the supply of local content programming genuinely at the local level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing that this bill does—again, having heard all of the evidence in the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee—is amend the antisiphoning scheme and antisiphoning notice. This scheme was established in 1994 and regulates the acquisition of broadcast rights for sporting and other events of cultural significance or national importance. This bill seeks to ensure that events on the antisiphoning list remain freely available to all Australian viewers. This government continues to support the principle that nationally significant events should be available to free-to-air television. The antisiphoning scheme is outdated and needs reform. Again, it does not cater for the new digital media communications environment. The bill will remove the multichannelling rule, which prevents free-to-air broadcasters from televising events first or exclusively on their digital multimedia channels. Repealing the multichannelling rule will provide flexibility for free-to-air broadcasters to optimise television coverage of listed events to the benefit of audiences right across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth great thing that this bill does—and, again, having heard a lot of evidence on this in the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee when we looked at this bill—is abolish TV and radio licence fees and other charges. The committee heard overwhelming evidence that these licence fees and datacasting charges have absolutely no place in a modern regulatory framework in the digital age. They were designed for a very different nation and a very different type of media. This bill will repeal the unwarranted taxes, starting with the payment that would be otherwise due in December 2017. Instead, the government will establish tax collection and assessment arrangements for an interim transmitter licence tax and will establish a statutory review of the arrangements in 2021—a very sound idea. The introduction of a transmitter licence tax and the abolition of the broadcasting licence fees will result in the vast majority of broadcasters paying considerably less in terms of their overall fee and tax burden. Again, I point out that these are fees and tax burdens that their digital competitors, who are streaming right across this country into their markets, are not subject to. It is grossly unfair that we are saddling certain broadcasters with these outdated fees and taxes and not subjecting them to those who now broadcast the same content or similar content directly to our homes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the government will establish a transitional support payment scheme for commercial broadcasters—again, a very sensible and sound measure. This five-year transitional support package will provide financial relief up to 30 June 2020. It supports 19 individual commercial broadcasters to transition to the new spectrum tax model, helps optimise their business structures and supports growth over the medium to long term. And, as I've said, importantly, that will help them also provide much more genuinely local content in rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this package, the legislation will require the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to, after 30 June 2019, undertake a review and report on whether the new tax laws should be repealed or amended. Again, this is a very sensible measure. ACMA will consult on the review, enabling broadcasters to input into the development of the future tax arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a historic media package that has the support of the entire media sector. We have heard very clear and cogent arguments of why this reform is so necessary to retain the diversity and the richness of, and the commercial viability of, this sector in our community. I commend the government for this package.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  The government wants One Nation support for this package so badly that it has agreed to invite a razor gang into the books of the ABC. And it wants Nick Xenophon's support for the package so badly that it has agreed not to embarrass him into being forced to vote in support of One Nation's proposal. But make no mistake, voting for this bill means voting for One Nation's deal. I know that, One Nation knows that and you can bet your last dollar that Nick Xenophon and his team know that, too.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As for what the details are, we still don't know. The government won't tell us and they won't tell us. All we know is that it commits the government to review the ABC and ask if it is reducing the profitability of its commercial rivals. Guess what? The job of the ABC isn't to make money for its commercial rivals. Its job is to guarantee all Australians have access to news, programming and information that affects their lives, no matter where they live or how wealthy they are. The deal the government has made isn't designed to improve the ABC; it is designed to defund it. It's a deal to set up a rigged kangaroo court that is determined to find the ABC guilty and lay the groundwork for slashing the budget of the most trusted news source in the country—or, as I like to refer to it, the eighth great wonder of the world.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the deal that is before us. That is the vote we are taking—to defend the ABC or to defund it. No amount of tax breaks or inquiries into tech giants can change that. As the old saying goes, if you don't know all the details of the deal, don't vote for it. If you knew all the details of the deal, you probably wouldn't vote for it anyway. A vote in favour of this package is a vote in favour of all the strings that come attached to it. The government could have opted to put the full details of the deal in the legislation, but it decided not to because it is embarrassed by what it has agreed to. And if something is so embarrassing that not even this government would be willing to put its name to it, then it says something about all those who are voting to support it. No matter what else is said, no matter who says it, there's only one thing you need to remember: if you are proud of something, you don't hide it.</span>

What we're doing by voting for this media reform package is actually voting for a dirty deal, because the government decided to link the two. We are voting for something on paper and another thing altogether in practice. We're choosing whether to defend the ABC or to defund it. I will not endorse this deal. I am willing to vote to help the commercial players by doing away with outdated media ownership regulations but I refuse to vote for a package that hurts journalism in rural and regional Australia.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, seriously. Yesterday, the minister dismissed the Commonwealth's involvement in the projects in Queensland contracted to Newlands Civil Construction. I refer to the National Partnership Agreement on Land Transport Infrastructure Projects, an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. Can the minister confirm that the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing project, under which Newlands Civil Construction has been contracted to deliver at least $2.5 million in works, is included in the agreement and is 80 per cent funded by the Commonwealth?</span>

This is the minister representing the relevant minister for the Commonwealth ruling out that Senator O'Sullivan has received financial benefit as a result of involvement in family companies gaining $6 million in Commonwealth contracts. It is not relevant to say that Senator O'Sullivan has said that. The question is to the minister representing the minister who has carriage of this substantial amount of money.</span>

Mr President, Australia supports the unanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council this morning to impose further sanctions on North Korea, following their claimed test of a hydrogen bomb earlier this month, with the adoption of UNSC resolution 2375. These are the types of sanctions imposed on the regime to date. Among the sanctions imposed, the resolution cuts off over 55 per cent of gas supplies, diesel and heavy fuel oil going to the regime. It completely bans natural gas and other oil by-products that could be used as substitutes. Today's resolution also bans all textile exports, which follows on from resolutions banning both coal and iron exports. There are also bans on the regime from making money from North Koreans working overseas and asset freezes on the most central North Korean regime entities. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures will make it far more difficult for the regime to be able to fuel and to finance its illegal ballistic and nuclear weapons program. However, it is our view, as we have stated, Mr President, that the sanctions won't be completely effective unless all nations implement them with absolute resolve. As I said in my remarks to the Seoul Defense Dialogue in South Korea last Thursday, we can't let North Korea's brinkmanship succeed. Australia will continue to encourage other nations to join in collective action to the fullest extent possible against North Korea's renewed threats of offensive action.</span>

We continue, of course, to rely on intelligence as it comes to light to refine and to extend our autonomous sanctions regime.</span>

I can of course confirm that the report has been received and that the state minister has made some comments relating to that. I do note that Minister Niall Blair has announced that he will immediately look to act on key components of the Water Management Compliance Improvement Package, which has been recommended by Mr Matthews in his interim report. I also note the speed with which the minister acted in this area. This is of course a matter for the state government, and I do note the very quick response that we have seen from the water minister in New South Wales.</span>

Indeed, there have been a number of very appropriate measures put in place to deal with this issue. Firstly, of course, we have seen the independent inquiry led by Ken Matthews, which has handed down its report. We've seen the Commonwealth-initiated Murray-Darling Basin Authority review of the basin-wide compliance regimes. We've seen the ANAO audit of the national partnership agreement on implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We have seen referrals to the New South Wales ICAC and, of course, the Senate rural and regional affairs committee inquiry into the integrity of the water market.</span>

                  </a>  the energy crisis in Australia would be much, much worse than it is today. Indeed, Senator Williams is right: the lights probably wouldn't be on in here if the Greens had had their way. If the Greens had had their way, every single renewable energy target that was put forward would never have been enough. If the Greens had had their way, every single carbon tax proposal put forward would never have been enough. If the Greens had had their way, they, of course, would have taxed to closure every single coal-fired generator in the country by now. That would have been the policy proposition of the Australian Greens. Would we have had any dispatchable base load power today? No, we would not have had anything that the Australian energy market could have relied on if the Greens had had their way. So the very idea of Senator Di Natale coming in here, wanting to talk about energy affordability or energy reliability, is preposterous, because the Greens have been the ones who have gone on and on over the years, seeking harsher policies that would have simply driven prices up, driven affordability down, driven reliability down, driven energy generation out of business and ensured that we had nothing that was reliable, nothing that was dispatchable and nothing that was base load. All, of course—</span>

We've given Senator Birmingham until he has less than 20 seconds left. He has not come within a million miles of addressing the question. President, I remind you: the question wasn't about the Greens policy; it was about the government's lack of a coherent energy policy and the fact that things are crumbling around them.

But what he wants to do, of course, is stand in the corner with the multimillion-dollar CEOs and argue their case, rather than arguing the case for lower energy prices and for action in the energy market that actually delivers for consumers: power stability, power reliability, certainty that the lights will go on when you flick the switch, and certainty that businesses can invest and keep operating in the future. That's why the Turnbull government and Mr Turnbull have been absolutely clear about expecting solutions, in terms of the AEMO report, for certainty around the availability of base-load dispatchable energy, and we are working to make sure that's the case.</span>

I invite them to actually look closely at the AEMO report and what it says about the reliability of the energy market, what it says about the one-gigawatt shortage in terms of base-load dispatchable energy we have at present and what it says about the further one-gigawatt shortage of reliable base-load dispatchable energy that would occur by 2022 if Liddell closes then. That is the reality that we are dealing with. Senator Di Natale can come in here and try to claim that the solution to that is to somehow further invest in intermittent energy, but we know the solution is to ensure you have greater reliability of base-load dispatchable energy. Senator Di Natale still doesn't seem to have comprehended the differences between intermittent energy and dispatchable base-load energy. We understand it. We are seeking to get the balance in the energy market that can improve affordability and reliability for all Australians.</span>

But what I can confirm is that this government is doing more than the previous Labor government ever did to deal with the issue of energy prices for Australians. Never was that more clearly revealed, Senator McAllister, than when your shadow minister, Mr Mark Butler, last week revealed, accepted, confessed that it was as a result of the Labor government's decision not to regulate the export of gas from the Australian market that Australian energy prices have increased. One of the reasons why Australian energy prices have increased, as your own shadow minister has conceded, is a mistaken decision made by your government to allow unregulated exports of gas from the Australian gas fields. Now, Senator McAllister—</span>

                  </a>  Senator Wong, let me take your interjection. Let me run you through, Senator Wong, some of the RET measures that the Australian government has taken to ensure that there is downward pressure on energy prices. First of all, we haven't repeated the mistake that you now admit that you made in deregulating the export of gas. We have regulated the export of gas to ensure that that resource is available to Australian consumers before it is available to overseas consumers. Secondly, Senator McAllister, the Prime Minister and the minister for energy have intervened directly with the energy suppliers to ensure transparency in their billing to Australian consumers. All Australian consumers can now be reassured that they will have transparency in their billing so that they can be on the cheapest plan possible. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I can tell you what else the Australian government are doing. By abolishing the limited merits review we have prevented the energy companies from gaming the system. The limited merits review has inflated the costs to Australian consumers in the Australian energy market by $3.5 billion per annum. When we came forward with legislation for that proposal, what did the Australian Labor Party do? They parked the bill in the Senate so that the benefit to the Australian people would be delayed for as long as— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This government is determined to make its policy choices on the basis of economics and engineering, compared to you, Senator McAllister, and your party, who seem to be driven by your need to compete with the Greens to secure an ideological approach to energy policy. Our approach to energy policy, Senator McAllister, is not ideological; it is pragmatic. We are determined to ensure that Australians have affordable and reliable power, and we do that by being pragmatic. We are agnostic as to the source of the power, whether it be coal, whether it be gas or whether it be renewables. We have an all-of-the-above approach—whatever is available and whatever is most affordable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He, like everybody on this side of the chamber, appreciates that there are no silver bullets to address the energy challenges that Australia faces. It requires consistent, comprehensive action across all of the different components of the energy market: retail, network, distribution and generation. All of those are essential for us to tackle, and that is why as a government we are taking action across each and every one of those fronts. It's why we are taking action in terms of generator reliability obligations, ensuring that they must balance intermittent renewable generation with storage backup to guarantee dispatchability; ensuring energy security obligations, so that the systems must deal with maintenance of inertia, to guarantee that systems continue to work effectively in the future; new arrangements around guaranteed closure notice periods that can provide governments with time to deal with the uncertainty created by intended closures such as that at Liddell, for example; and further pressure applying in terms of the abolition of the limited merits review process, so networks can no longer game the system, something that has hit consumers with about $6 billion in additional costs over a period of time. We're taking that action. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite criticised us, saying that it had been taking too long for the abolition of limited merits review to happen. The member for Port Adelaide attacked that in June this year, and yet the opposition in this chamber, when we bring legislation here, then delays its consideration, delays that action being put into place. It shows the hypocrisy we get from those opposite. Equally, we are taking the steps to get more gas into the market. This is important for direct gas users as well as energy consumers overall. Just last week, Santos announced it would provide an additional 30 petajoules into the domestic market as well as 27 petajoules for feedstock suppliers. This is critical. Labor again admitted they knew in government there was a problem there but did nothing. This government is fixing it.</span>

The member for Port Adelaide, the opposition's energy spokesman, said that he didn't accept the premise of that report and that he didn't think it was a problem for today, and the Leader of the Opposition dismissed it all as a distraction and the wrong priority. </span>

That's why the Prime Minister and the energy minister met with AGL yesterday, why we secured their commitment to come back within 90 days to demonstrate what they will do and for the government to consider what we may need to do in that instance. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We know that that's not true. We know that their approaches in the past are what got us into this mess today. We know that the approaches of state Labor governments got those states into an even bigger mess and are getting some states into bigger messes still. We know that, in Victoria, the closure of Hazelwood has contributed to a $135 increase in average household electricity bills. That's triple what Premier Dan Andrews promised. It's triple the cost estimates that he made in terms of that closure. We know that the closure of Northern in South Australia not only applied price pressures into the market but also undermined reliability. That's why we're taking actions now in relation to Liddell in 2022, to guarantee that we don't see a repeat of those mistakes of those past governments. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In 2016 the Australian National Audit Office released a report into the management of the HELP scheme. It recommended that your department and the Australian tax office could be more effective in managing the loans scheme. Given your stated preference for efficiency, why have you not opted to improve your in-house administration of this scheme instead of making life more difficult for Australians trying to get a foothold?</span>

We have taken a number of steps in relation to the administration and operation of the HELP scheme. Most notably in my time as minister, we passed legislation through this place to expand collection of debts to graduates who are living and working overseas, to ensure that we reduce the level of debt not expected to be repaid. Further, in relation to the way the HELP scheme interacts with the vocational student loan market, we abolished the failed VET FEE-HELP program of those opposite, which saw billions of dollars of loans that were never going to amount to anything given out, and we have now put in place, with the support of the Senate, I note, a much more stringent vocational student loans market that does guarantee far tighter access to loans, much better value for money for taxpayers, much better results for students. So, across all of those areas, we have taken real action on the student loans scheme, which is one of the most generous in the world, in terms of there being no real interest rate charged to students and a very high threshold at which repayments kick in, relative to any of the comparable schemes around the world. Our scheme is more sustainable into the future. But the reality we face is that there is around $50 billion of unpaid debt, student loan debt, on the books at present and on current settings, no matter how efficient governments are, in terms of the repayment rates, around 25 per cent of that $50 billion will not be repaid. The Turnbull government doesn't believe that is sustainable for the long term and, if we want to preserve access to university with no up-front fees—free of charge, essentially, and for people to walk through the gate and only repay when they get a reasonable income—then we need to make sure that loan book is more sustainable into the future, which is what our reforms seek to do.</span>

These are undertakings universities had already committed to do. All we're doing is indicating that they need to meet those commitments and the performance funding will flow. We drafted and sent out to different sector stakeholders a discussion paper around the future implementation of performance funding to seek their feedback, having given the commitment that its ongoing design and operation would be done in consultation with the university leaderships and their representative bodies, and that is exactly what we are doing. Next year's standards are crystal clear. We have been very clear about the process for how it will be implemented thereafter, and we are committed to working with the university sector around that reform.</span>

I emphasise to Senator Lambie and to the Senate overall that the reason we are pursuing the performance funding mechanism is to put some level of accountability and responsiveness into university funding. At present, Australian universities can enrol as many students as they want in whatever disciplines they want and the taxpayer funding just flows through. We believe it's important there be some accountability—that universities are enrolling people in disciplines where graduates get a job; that students are supported through their studies to completion; that students are getting high-quality teaching and learning; that it's not unreasonable that some level of the guaranteed funding is conditional upon meeting minimum performance benchmarks; and that universities are held to account for ensuring excellence in their teaching and good outcomes for their graduates. That's why we're proposing that. We want to work with the sector to make sure it works effectively and it's developed in a way that achieves the outcomes the government has, which are for the best interests of students and taxpayers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The question really goes to the timing of this mechanism and this trigger. If those opposite had actually focused on the piece of legislation and the regulations that flowed from that, they would know it doesn't matter when we pull the trigger between now and 1 November; the trigger doesn't come into effect until 1 January. You are just going to have to wait until after you open your presents! Just take a chill pill about this. We have until 1 November to pull the trigger on this mechanism, which has been put in place to send a clear signal to industry—which have obviously got the signal because there have been significant changes with regard to gas being placed on the domestic market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on those opposite to actually try to better understand the circumstances. I will explain again for their benefit, Mr President. You can pull that trigger today or tomorrow, up to 1 November, and on 1 January, by agreement with the industry and those in this place, that trigger will take place. It gives the industry two full months, eight weeks, to get that in place. The most important aspect of this is that we need to ensure that this is pulled when industry aren't moving themselves. </span>

It doesn't matter whether we pull it today, tomorrow or the next day; it will happen and will only happen on 1 January by agreement. I didn't hear a bleat from the other side that this process wasn't the right process when we brought in this regulation. We didn't hear, 'We need to suddenly turn the gas from offshore to onshore'—somebody wrestling with a large tap every day, running up to 1 November.</span>

Colleagues will be interested to know that between 2007 and 2013 the previous Labor government gave colleagues $27 million in grants to unions and union peak bodies in the employment portfolio alone—but get this—to support the unions in carrying out their core business. As I say, nice deal, if you can get one from Labor. The bulk of this money was provided by guess who? The now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, when he was the Minister for Employment. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this time, Mr Shorten authorised an $11 million grant to his friends at the ACTU—$11 million. It was supposedly for a 10-year contract to run from 2012 to 2022. But get this: it came from the former Labor government's Productivity Education and Training Fund, also known as the PET Fund or, as it was coined, 'Mr Shorten's PET Fund'. From Mr Shorten's PET Fund, he took $11 million and handed it over to the ACTU. This funding was meant to be used for the ACTU to train union officials and educate them about the workplace relations system. I would have thought that was core business and that the unions should have been doing that in any event, but Mr Shorten thought they needed $11 million extra of taxpayers' money. </span>

Given it was an $11 million grant to the ACTU, I can see that there was a direct benefit to the ACTU. But what's worse is that there was potentially a benefit to Mr Shorten. Just a year after giving this money over to the unions, he was seeking their support to become the leader of the Australian Labor Party and, on top of that, the ACTU did support him. What the ACTU is now doing with this money remains a mystery, because the bulk of the money remains unspent for the purposes it was intended. Yet again, what does this show? Mr Shorten, if he was ever given the keys to this place, could never be trusted to appropriately spend taxpayers' money. </span>

A national prioritisation list for the Home Care Packages Program was introduced in February, but vulnerable older Australians are still in the dark about where they are in the queue and how long they will have to wait to receive a package. Minister Ken Wyatt first promised to release the wait-time data in July and, following that failure, recommitted to do so by the end of August. Given it is now the second week in September, when will the Turnbull government finally release this information?</span>

He is certainly someone who knows the importance of industries that support local jobs, particularly in regional Australia. I'm pleased to say that the resources industry is making a great contribution to the nation: six per cent of our GDP, $200 billion a year in exports and, in particular, employment for the breadwinners of 235,000 families. I'm pleased to advise you, Senator O'Sullivan, that around 10,000 people are directly employed in those communities you represent around Central Queensland. This isn't just about 10,000 jobs; they also add to Central Queensland's regional economy, and business confidence is growing strongly. The Queensland Resources Council reckons that about $2.1 billion is spent on goods and services, which benefits over 3,500 local businesses. In the Rockhampton local government area alone, 1,000 local businesses benefitted from the $280 million spent on goods and services in 2015-16.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator, I know you'd also be pleased to know that we've issued a new mandate for the Export Finance Investment Corporation that will support our resources industry. The Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment issued a new mandate which will allow Efic to support a wider range of exporters, enabling support for our domestic resources. This is all about opening up more opportunities for the resource industry to contribute to our nation. But, of course, this approach is not something that we are seeing across the political spectrum. I say to those opposite: if you could talk to the Labor governments in Victoria and the Northern Territory, which seem to be the prime offenders, it would be terrific, because at the moment they are going against the specific advice of Australia's Chief Scientist, who has advised that we should develop these resources on a case-by-case basis. So I encourage those opposite to do something with your state colleagues and backflip on these bans and moratoriums that are locking up 100 years of power and opportunity. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This is the case with our new mandate of Efic, which will open up more opportunities to support our resource industry. We're doing this in a sophisticated way. We're not just opening up opportunities; we're making sure that small and medium Australian enterprises don't suffer. That's why these resources are only pointing in where there's a demonstrated market gap. The best way to keep pressure on power prices is to open up more opportunities to generate electricity. That is why we have introduced the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism to ensure that we have more opportunities to increase the supply of gas into the market. We have met with the heads of industry and we have taken strong action to ensure we bring these prices down.</span>

I can confirm that it is the policy of the government and that the Prime Minister has made it very clear that the government will be doing everything in its power to put downward pressure on electricity prices. Let me explain to you, Mr President, how the Australian government intends to do that. I tried to explain that to Senator McAllister before, but let me go through it again and, in doing so, might I remind you, Mr President, that during the period of the Labor government in which Senator Carr was a senior minister—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M56" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PAYNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  As I foreshadowed yesterday, I have some further information from the Minister for Human Services for Senator Hinch in relation to a question he asked me last week concerning eligibility for the DSP. The minister advises that eligibility for the DSP is determined by assessing the impact the condition has on an individual's capacity to work rather than the condition itself. To be eligible for the DSP, the legislative requirements are that an individual's condition needs to be fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised as well as attract a rating of at least 20 points under the impairment tables. While I can't comment on the specifics of the individual case that the senator referred to, it is important to note that there are specific eligibility criteria for all income support payments. So I emphasise again that eligibility for the DSP is determined by assessing the functional impact that a condition has on the person in question and not on the presence of any particular medical condition itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be granted a DSP, a person must, in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, meet both the income and assets tests, except of course unless they are permanently blind; have a permanent physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment with a rating of at least 20 points under the impairment tables; be unable to work for 15 hours or more per week within the next two years because of their condition; and have actively participated in a program of support—for example, JobSearch, rehabilitation, educational or training—unless they have a severe impairment or they're manifestly eligible, such as where a person has a terminal illness. While a disability support pension claim is being processed, other income support is available, such as Newstart allowance or youth allowance, with an exemption of all mutual obligation activities, including looking for work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the qualifications of DSP assessors, job capacity assessors in the Department of Human Services are qualified health and allied health professionals. There are a variety of professional qualifications, ranging from registered nurses to psychologists and occupational therapists. The department works to align individuals with an assessor who has related qualifications to assess the condition in question. The department also has a health professional advisory unit staffed by qualified medical practitioners and can also contact a person's treating health professional.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a pathetic attempt by this government to fudge the figures and not release any data relating to the aged care home care packages. We have been waiting since February—seven months—and there are older Australians who have been waiting for more than two years for home care packages. We know they go from level 1, which is the lowest, up to level 4. This is a really serious issue for older Australians, and there wouldn't be very many families in this country that aren't affected one way or the other when it comes to aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, we had the launch of the My Aged Care support line. The Minister for Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, admitted then that more than 200 people have been identified as waiting for over two years for these home care packages. I get calls into my office on a weekly basis from family members and older people who are distressed and so anxious about getting the support they need to be able to stay at home. Let's face it, this government has never had a good record when it comes to aged care. During the Howard government, we remember Bronwyn Bishop and the kerosene baths. We've now had three ministers in this government, and not one them has been able to progress any real reforms. In 2012, when we were in government, under former minister Mark Butler, Labor actually did the hard yards. We worked with the opposition at that time, we worked with the sector and we worked with consumers to make sure that we had the foundations there for reform that we knew was going to be of paramount importance to older Australians going forward. All of the hard work's already been done for them, yet they still can't roll out the reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you a couple of real examples of people that have been waiting for a long time. The minister suggesting that people aren't dying waiting for the delivery of these home care packages is outrageous, because she doesn't know. Not only was she ineligible, most likely, to be even sitting in this chamber but, as a minister, she obviously didn't have a brief on something that, as I said, is one of the major issues confronting the aged-care sector in this country. I know very well that the minister is very much aware of it. The issue is: how bad are these figures going to be? I think they're going to be much, much worse than what this government has ever anticipated. I have an example of an instance where a 92-year-old gentleman with high needs has been told that he will have to wait 18 months for a level 4 package. How absurd is that at 92? Just this morning, we had a constituent contact us whose mother was approved for a level 4 package 12 months ago. It was only this week that her mother received an interim level 2 package. This is just unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve much better from this government, particularly when it comes to older Australians. We know that the result of these long waiting times is that those older people who are on level 4 end up either going to an acute hospital, being prematurely put into residential homes or they die. That's the reality. I'm calling on the government—I couldn't believe that somebody who was responsible for health in regional Australia, Senator Nash, would not have that information. How out of touch are the government? How arrogant are they that they think that they can keep older Australians and their families in the dark about this data? One thing I will say is that data will be crucial in formulating policy going forward. This government will then have to act on that. Like most Australians, I'm afraid that we do not have the confidence in this government to be able to deliver the outcomes that Australians need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians, particularly our older Australians, deserve to have this support so they can stay at home much longer. That's a better outcome for whichever government is in power at a Commonwealth level. You save more money by keeping people in their own homes and giving them that support. But the last place older Australians want to end up in is an acute hospital. That is the last place that they want to be. They want to be able to age in their own home with dignity, with respect and with the care that they so justly deserve. This is a reflection on the government. It is one that I would be ashamed of if I were sitting on that side of the chamber. Older Australians deserve much better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What it shows us is that the Australian Labor Party has no plan and no vision for our great country. What they're able to do is throw a lot of stones from the sidelines without providing any genuine answers or policy prescriptions to deal with the issues confronting our nation. And so we had this bizarre question time today—all sorts of were issues raised, but there was no theme or coherence other than throwing stones, whereas on this side of the chamber the Australian people heard questions about international security—the threat from North Korea, a matter of genuine substance and a matter of genuine concern to the Australian people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, we are dealing with the issue of energy costs, something which impacts every single Australian, like a pensioner hoping to be able to heat their house in winter or cooling it in summer. It's a huge issue for every single pensioner in this country. It is an issue for the household budget, where mums and dads are trying desperately to keep the household budget in shape. It is of impact to the farmer, to the small businessman and, indeed, to the large manufacturers. Every single Australian is impacted by energy policy, and we have been left with a legacy from the Australian Labor Party and an approach by the Australian Labor Party where they would make the current problems so much worse, impacting our pensioners, our families, our small businesses and our farmers and manufacturers even more than they are impacted today. The government is getting on with the task. Labor can keep on throwing rocks and getting engaged in the personal vilification, but we will not be distracted from serving the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  I rise to take note of answers by Senator Brandis and Senator Nash in relation to energy. It wasn't that long ago, we all remember, that promises were made by Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott and other ministers in this government that, if they were elected to office, energy bills and electricity bills would fall by $550 all around Australia. But, of course, this is just one of those many promises that we saw from the Liberals that were broken as soon as they got into office. Whether it was about cuts to health care, cuts to education or cuts to electricity prices, the minute they got elected all of those promises were out the window.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've actually seen in reality is wholesale electricity prices double over the four years that this government has been in office. Every time we have ministers from this government get up and complain about energy prices, they need to have a look in the mirror, because they are the people who are responsible for this failure. And, unfortunately, ordinary Australians are paying the price through higher electricity bills. Every single solution that has been proposed to fix this has been blocked by elements within this government—the extreme right of the Liberal Party ganging up with the National Party—to kill off the carbon pollution reduction scheme from the Rudd and Gillard government and the emissions intensity scheme, something supported by the government's own Chief Scientist. Most recently, they have been ganging up to kill off the clean energy target, the latest suggestion by the Chief Scientist to try to bring energy prices under control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, why is this happening? As I say, it is because of the ganging up between the extreme right within the Liberal Party and National Party members of this government who are so blinded by their ideology that they have lost sight of the best solutions we have to try to bring energy prices under control. There is no issue on which they are more blinded by ideology than their obsessive opposition to renewable energy. Even just this weekend we saw it from the National Party again. They met up for their national conference in Canberra, and what did they decide to do? They decided to remove all subsidies for renewable energy. We are yet to hear from ministers on whether this decision from the National Party is actually going to be put into practice by this government. They are the junior partner in this coalition government, and you would think that decisions from their national conference would actually carry some weight. And this decision to remove subsidies from renewable projects is obviously bad for the environment, but it is equally bad for jobs, particularly in regional Queensland, in the state that I come from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day, we hear from the National Party that they are the party that represents regional Queensland and regional Australia. In actual fact, if you look at their record, they do nothing more than let down regional Australia, and they are doing it again here through their obsessive determination to kill off renewables and to kill off jobs in renewable energy right across Queensland. This decision from the federal National Party would kill thousands of jobs in renewable energy projects right across regional Queensland. Now, don't just believe me when I'm saying this. From the government's own renewable energy body, ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Authority—its own reports say that due to ARENA's own federal government funding it will support 2,300 direct jobs in the Australian regions, and thousands of indirect jobs in creating new renewable energy projects right across Australia. In Queensland alone, there are a number of projects that are being supported by federal government funding that would not go ahead without it, and we would see hundreds of jobs sacrificed at the altar of the National Party's ideological opposition to renewables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 500 jobs at the Kidston solar farm near Georgetown in north Queensland, 200 jobs at the Whitsunday Solar Farm near Collinsville in Central Queensland, 175 jobs at the Barcaldine Solar Farm in Central Queensland, another 120 jobs at the Collinsville solar power station in Central Queensland, 30 jobs at the Longreach Solar Farm in Central Queensland and, in south-west Queensland, 50 jobs at the Oakey Solar Farm. Just that handful of projects adds up to about a 1,000 jobs in regional Queensland that are only happening because of this federal government's support for renewable energy. We don't think it's as strongly supportive as it should be, but the Nationals actually want to kill off these subsidies and kill off these thousands of jobs in Queensland and right across Australia. The Nationals do not support regional Australia. They need to get behind these projects. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  I was very grateful to have the opportunity to participate in the MPI debate yesterday, initiated by the Labor Party, on energy. So I'm even more delighted to have an opportunity to re-emphasise some of the points that I made yesterday and to add some new ones to this very important debate. I thank them, again, for bringing this important issue before us. Senator Watt's contribution leant heavily on the theme of ideology, and he accused the coalition of being ideological in our approach to energy when we know that nothing could be further from the truth and we know that the only ideological parties on this question are, in fact, the Labor Party and the Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has an agnostic approach to energy. We don't feel the need to pick and choose and to support winners above others within the energy market. We think it would be a great thing if renewable energy prospered, just as we think that other forms of energy that meet our energy needs should grow and prosper. That may include, and should include, base load traditional sources of energy such as coal and gas. One of the other common refrains from those opposite in this debate is that what we need and what we lack in this policy space is certainty and, if only the energy industry had certainty, then prices would be stable or may even fall. But the truth is that part of the energy industry already has certainty, and that's the renewable part of the energy industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The renewable part of the industry has certainty, and we know that they do because there's been record investments in renewable in recent years under this government and under the policies of this government. In 2016, large-scale renewable energy investment was at a record high, and it was five times greater than it was in 2015. More than $4 billion has been committed over the last year in renewable energy investment. Of the 98 new power plants accredited in 2016, 86 were solar and, just in case you are not clear, zero were gas and zero were coal. Small-scale renewable investment was also strong with 182,000 new installations last year. So there's no lack of certainty for the renewable energy industry. There is a lack of certainty for other players in the energy market, and they are providers of traditional thermal base-load power, such as coal or gas—an essential part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future until we can get to a system that somehow can provide sufficient backup or reserves, because we know that renewable energy is variable and unreliable due to weather conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why don't coal and gas have certainty? Why isn't anyone investing in these products? Why hasn't a power plant of these types been built for the last 10 years in Australia? Because they're lacking certainty. And their lack of certainty is a future Labor government. They know there is a chance of a future Labor government, and they know when it comes their business model could be completely smashed by a carbon tax, an emissions trading scheme, an emission intensity scheme or what other new name the Labor Party comes up with for its plans to tax energy production. For an investor in a coal-fired power station—even a new high-efficiency, low-emissions one—or in a gas-fired power station, when they're contemplating their 30-year return on investment that they need for their business model to work, they know that they don't have the certainty they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's also worth unpacking exactly what the Labor Party and the Greens mean by certainty when they're talking about the renewable energy industry. Normally, when businesses are seeking certainty what they are seeking is a stable policy environment, secure property rights and certainty around taxation to make sure that, basically, they can run their own business without intervention and be confident that they'll get a reasonable return on their investment. That's the certainty that most businesses seek. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The certainty that the Labor Party and the Greens are seeking on behalf of the renewable energy industry is not property rights certainty; it is not stable tax arrangements; it is certainty of subsidies. Senator Watt admitted it in his own contribution to this debate. He said that the renewable energy industry requires subsidies in order to succeed. They need subsidies. So the certainty they seek is taxpayers and energy users—consumers—continuing to pay renewable energy companies, even when their products are not competitive, when they're not economic, to have that certainty of return. The coalition doesn't believe in this approach. The coalition believes, as I said earlier, in an agnostic approach that allows all forms of energy to compete fairly and evenly and allows those which have the best model to succeed. We're not in the business of picking winners and choosing winners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that there is some risk to the renewable energy industry from the removal of subsidies completely undercuts their argument that renewables are currently cost competitive. We heard in this debate only yesterday from Senator McAllister that renewables are cost competitive, that they are efficient, that they are, in fact, even cheaper than traditional forms of energy. Why do they need subsidies then? For what purpose should we subsidise an alternative energy source which is apparently more efficient and cheaper? It shouldn't be necessary at all. They should be able to survive on their own two feet. The truth is that those opposite know that they are not yet ready to survive on their own two feet. Perhaps they will be one day. Hopefully, they will be one day. But the truth is, right now, today, they need subsidies, and those opposite are calling for certainty of taxpayer subsidies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to look at the inconsistency from the leadership of the federal government. We've had the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, walk into the chamber carrying a lump of coal. We've seen him say he is for coal-fired power generation; we've seen him say he's against coal-fired power generation. We've seen the Prime Minister say he's for coal-fired power generation and we've seen him say he's against coal-fired power generation. This is all in recent months. It is because of a lack of leadership from the Prime Minister that this is happening. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no clear direction on energy from the federal government of Australia. I'm going to break it down into three parts: their record since they were elected; their record since the Finkel report came down; and their record when it comes to long-term policy decision-making. In each one of these areas, they are severely lacking. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few people have talked about their record since they got elected. We know that former Prime Minister Abbott promised that power bills would be lowered by $550, yet here we are four years later and they're up almost $1,000 around the country. We know they had a war on renewables, halting investment in new generation and halting job creation at the same time. Following a question from Senator McAllister today, we know that they've overseen 4,000 megawatts of generation exit the market, including Hazelwood. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The true tragedy of Hazelwood closing was the fact that that community and those workers got six months to prepare. That is absolutely ridiculous, but that is what happened on this government's watch. Yet here they are crying crocodile tears for the workers at Liddell, when that company has been responsible in giving significant notice and coming up with a plan to transition those workers into other jobs. Yet that side are prepared to play politics. We have the Minister for the Environment and Energy, the faux friend of the worker, Josh Frydenberg, suddenly saying he is concerned for those workers and wanting to provide an ongoing future for them. It is playing politics with their lives. What we saw with Hazelwood is their true record when it comes to it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their record since they were elected is a sorry one, but their record since Finkel was released is just as dire. More than three months ago now the Finkel report came down. What have we seen in regard to the clean energy target? No progress whatsoever. In fact, based on what we saw at the weekend, it's probably regressed. They're making no progress at all in trying to reach an agreement within the coalition, let alone talking to the Labor Party to provide that certainty that so many people have spoken about. We've seen numerous examples of the Prime Minister having cups of tea with energy retailers, yet the best we've seen out of that is a letter. That's all consumers are going to see by the end of the year: they're going to get a letter. That's the best the Prime Minister could do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, when it comes to the long-term policy and his discussions with AGL, every time they have a meeting we get different reports. The Treasurer and the energy minister say they have agreed that they will look at selling it, and then AGL contradict that. We have seen in the last 24 hours similar examples where the records of the government and of AGL are quite different. This is the chaos and dysfunction that we're seeing from that side with regard to energy. Today we put questions to Senator Scullion around the domestic gas security mechanism. We have seen uncertainty around its legitimacy because it was brought in by Senator Canavan. When asked about it yesterday, this was the response from Senator Brandis: 'We have restricted gas exports.' It was clear today, from the nonanswer from Senator Scullion, that they have done nothing like that as yet. We know that they have time to do it, but so far they have done nothing on that, contradicting the answer that we had from Senator Brandis yesterday. And there has been no action on the five-minute settlement when it comes to wholesale power prices, something that has been identified that can drive down costs. This is the record of the government when it comes to long-term energy policy. It is a sorry tale indeed. Overall what we are seeing under the government is prices up, pollution up, reliability down and a government that blame everyone else because they have a lack of leadership to settle a long-term policy for the benefit of Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to a question without notice asked by Senator Lambie today relating to funding for higher education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Birmingham misled Australians when he referred to his higher education bill as reform. Spending cuts are not reform, and the bill is nothing but a cost-cutting venture. If Minister Birmingham gets his way and his higher education bill passes the Senate, students will pay more, sooner, for less. They will more quickly accrue a larger debt, which they will be asked to pay off before they are financially ready to, and for what? What does the government seriously think is going to happen when the universities respond to massive cuts to their budgets? Does he think universities won't make tough decisions like closing down regional campuses? When you cut a university's funding, they won't just shrug it off; they will withdraw their investments in infrastructure and student accommodation, cancel their investment in start-up incubators and innovation hubs and cut research even further. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who wins from this? Australian students won't have access to world-class education. They will only have access to a bare-bones education. It is what has become of Prime Minister Turnbull's innovation agenda. Is the Prime Minister's commitment to innovation so shallow that he would reserve his deepest, most damaging cuts for centres of innovation all around the country? A postgraduate voucher system will create uncertainty for universities, preventing them from doing crucial planning. It would be simpler to just not run postgraduate qualifications altogether. The performance contingent funding and efficiency dividend will lock a huge number of disadvantaged and regional students out of the opportunity to chase their dreams and further themselves and their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can wave goodbye to Australia, the lucky country, the land of opportunity. You can wave goodbye to a fair go for all. Instead, Australia will become a land where the rich get richer and the poor just keep getting poorer. Instead of attracting the best of the best from all over the world to engage in world-class research, we will lose our best students and researchers to countries that actually value a higher education as an asset, not just a cost. We will lose jobs, investment and export opportunities to countries that value higher education and the role it has to play in the economy, in building vibrant cities and in boosting wage growth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No other sector has been subjected to cuts this devastating in the 2017-18 budget. They are the largest cuts to universities in two decades. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your innovative and agile government. The government says no sector is immune from the need for budget repair, but keep in mind that the university sector has already been forced to make savings of $3.9 billion since 2011. Now the government is looking to slash another $3.8 billion from the Education Investment Fund, from infrastructure funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's rhetoric that universities can afford these cuts because they are all profiting is an absolute joke. Universities do not profit. When a university is lucky enough to post a surplus, it is invested in research infrastructure or student support programs. That is what is under attack with this bill: research, infrastructure and student support programs. We'll lose the things that enrich the country because, apparently, we're not rich enough to afford them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Birmingham has attempted to mislead the public throughout this debate, trying to paint universities as bloated bureaucracies growing fat on the public purse. But the reality is that cutting universities means making students fund the cuts with higher fees. Let's not forget the hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs that are at risk from these cuts. What does the coalition government think that will do to the communities where the university is the largest employer? In fact, the University of Tasmania is one of the biggest employers in the whole state. Any job cuts in the current economic climate would be absolutely devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the coalition government have against further education for Australians? If Minister Birmingham wants to talk about reforms, great; then let's talk about reform. But don't insult us by taking a bill for budget cuts and rebadging it as reform. Real reform would look at finding the right funding balance between teaching and research. Real reform would invest more into research so Australian students can lead the way on breakthroughs and innovation. Real reform asks, 'What are we trying to achieve?' not just, 'What are we trying to cut?' This isn't reform; this is, plainly speaking, a ramraid.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">(b) on 31 March 2017, a Request for Tender (RFT) was released by the Department of Defence to three foreign companies which stated that it was the Commonwealth's intention that the successful tenderer will directly manage and supervise the workforce undertaking the shipbuilding work, and that the responsibility for build management and supervision should not be subcontracted in its entirety to a third party entity;</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(c) the effect of these RFT terms is that Australian shipbuilders ASC Pty Ltd and Austal have been locked out of priming the Frigate Program project and this current plan places Australian shipbuilders in the shadows of new invitee foreign shipyards; noting ASC Shipbuilding has no work on its order books beyond 2019, the Government's approach could have significant impact on the future prospects of the company, and Austal will survive but certainly will not thrive;</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(f) it is implausible that permitting the fully-established, world-class, Australian shipbuilders ASC Pty Ltd and Austal and their experienced workforce and proven track records would slow down a program that would otherwise require the setting up, from scratch, of a foreign shipbuilder with no current workforce.</span>

The Australian government is strongly committed to boosting the health and resilience of the reef through the Reef 2050 Plan. Our projections show that both governments will invest more than $2 billion in protecting the reef over a decade, including through key measures such as improving water quality and by culling crown-of-thorns starfish. In July 2017, UNESCO praised Australia's work in implementing the Reef 2050 Plan.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, I am proud to present the Parliamentary Business Resources Amendment (Voluntary Opt-out) Bill 2017. This measure was a core commitment of mine to the people of Queensland and Australia, to whom I serve, after the recent outrageous pay rises of parliamentarians, coming off the back of stagnating wages growth over the last decade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Everyday Australians would be appalled to know that not only do politicians constantly gleefully accept pay rises, but if one of their more modest colleagues wants to refuse acceptance of that pay rise they are unable to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As stated in the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of this bill is to for provide Senators and Members the option to 'opt-out' of receiving any or all of their entitlements. There is currently no mechanism available for Senators or Members to opt-out of receiving part or all of their entitlements. This bill will allow Senators or Members to provide, by written notice, that they wish to no longer receive part or all of their entitlements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians want a higher level of performance from their politicians. All too often the political elites let everyday Australians down. Pay is no exception. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If it is the case that the major parties want to band together and allow perpetual pay increases for politicians, so be it. However it is incumbent upon those with their snout in the trough to allow those who have respect for the Australian people to opt-out of a pay rise if they so wish. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Any politician who does not vote for this bill is sending a clear message to the Australian people that they lack respect for their fellow parliamentarians to refuse a pay rise, and what is worse, they lack respect for the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian people have the right to analyse who among those elected are the ones that want more pay, and who are the ones that are willing to take a haircut on their take home pay.</span>

However, the Government cynically sought to cut off this access to these terminally ill patients by blocking category A access for Australian produced medicinal cannabis in the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Act 2016, and introducing a disallowable instrument to block category A access for importation of international medicinal cannabis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 13 June 2017, the Senate voted to disallow the instrument blocking category A access to imported medicinal cannabis. This made it unlawful to prevent importation of medicinal cannabis via category A of the SAS. Despite this, the government wrote to all those suppliers with import licences, telling them that they would not be permitted to import under category A due to a condition in their import licence. They included in that letter a veiled threat that their licence would be in jeopardy should suppliers seek to import under category A.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second amendment this bill makes is to ensure that Australian medicinal cannabis, along with imported medicinal cannabis, is accessible via category A of the SAS. This not only ensures that emerging Australian medicinal cannabis suppliers are not disadvantaged; it also ensures that when Australian medicinal cannabis treatments become available, terminally ill patients will be able to access them rapidly. </span>

I won't lock off areas of my great state so that nobody gets to enjoy them. I say clearly that I don't support the motion. My question is whether or not the state Labor leader, Bec White, will do the same, instead of sitting in the middle. When she was asked for her thoughts yesterday, she offered no position whatsoever. We are now going into a state election. Labor wants to have a foot in both camps—for and against.

                  </a>  This is absolutely remarkable! This is as predictable as it is pathetic. We have the Liberal government—joined, it must be said, by the Labor Party, on a unity ticket when it comes to foreign policy—at a time when the world is on the brink of nuclear war, saying, 'We do not support the United Nations, who have overwhelmingly adopted a treaty banning nuclear weapons.' We've got 122 countries standing up to nuclear weapons states. At no time in human history has it been more important to disarm ourselves of these weapons of mass destruction. Yet Australia is missing in action. And it has to be said, while the opposition urges the government to participate in talks, it won't commit to signing the treaty on nuclear weapons. Now is the time for de-escalation, for disarmament, and this treaty is the pathway to get there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  There's no more important time to be reflecting on what a future of climate change looks like than now, when we are seeing such extreme weather events all around the world. It's not a future that any of us want, and we still have time to do something about it if we act. I know you've heard a lot from the Greens on this issue. I will take up Senator Birmingham's challenge from question time last week to actually hear from some climate scientists on this issue. I've been following several. There have been hundreds that have been speaking out on this issue in recent weeks around Hurricane Irma in the US. Mr Jon Foley said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm mad. We climate scientists have been warning people about climate change for decades, and politicians deliberately wasted that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scientists generally aren't political beings; they tend to operate outside of our political sphere, but many scientists are recognising now that science, especially climate science, is increasingly political. They understand that politics has failed to tackle the challenges of climate. It's failed the Great Barrier Reef. Recently, it looks very much like a future of climate change is upon us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to read to you a couple of quotes. The Mayor of Miami—a Republican mayor, may I say—whose citizens were recently evacuated, said, 'If not now, when do we discuss climate change?' He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is the time to talk about climate change. This is the time that the president and the EPA and whoever makes decisions needs to talk about climate change. If this isn't climate change, I don't know what is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span> recently posted an excellent article. They sought out the views of key climate scientists, many who actually live in Florida. Here's a sample of what some of them had to say. Professor Ben Kirtman, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said he believes it's more important to be discussing climate change around events like Irma. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's precisely the conversation that we should be having right now. I'm not sure what’s insensitive about that. It's really important to direct resources and funds to the crisis on the ground at the moment, of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said that we need to be talking about future consequences. Another scientist, Professor Leonard Berry, a former Director of the Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Immediately afterward we've got to say 'Come on guys, let's really see if this is a harbinger of the future.' And it clearly is to those of us who have looked even generally at the issue. One should be sensitive, but not stupid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President Trump, as we know, has derided climate change as a hoax. He's looking to cut significant funding to US climate programs. Another climate scientist, Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We know that as humans, we are all too good at pretending like a risk, even one we know is real, doesn't matter to us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When we try to warn people about the risks, there's no 'news' hook. No one wants to listen. That's why the time to talk about it is now. The most pernicious and dangerous myth we've bought into when it comes to climate change is not the myth that it isn't real or humans aren't responsible. It's the myth that it doesn't matter to me. And that is exactly the myth that Harvey shatters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have some quotes from Australian scientists that I won't be able to read out now. Climate change is here on us now. We should be discussing this. How are we going to act to prevent more of these damaging storms in the future? By cutting emissions— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I too rise to speak on this so-called matter of public importance. But, unlike those opposite, what I would like to do is begin by expressing my deepest condolences to the victims of the recent natural disasters that have been cited, which have tragically claimed the lives of several thousand people and devastated local communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm extremely proud that Australia has a leading role in international humanitarian responses to disasters, and we play a particularly important role in the Indo-Pacific region in combating the impacts of these natural disasters. Australia will invest another $12.3 million over three years in the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery to help build greater resilience in our region. I would point out that this government has increased Australia's humanitarian aid budget by 18 per cent for this financial year to support neighbouring countries' preparation and responses to these incidents. I'm very proud in particular that our wonderful ADF provides such brilliant support and humanitarian relief following natural disasters overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The natural disasters affecting South Asia and the Americas, which are cited in this so-called MPI, are tragic, and their victims deserve to be treated with the utmost respect and sympathy, as do all victims of other natural disasters that have occurred and continue to occur around the globe. But I've got to say I am utterly appalled that some in this place have sought to conflate and exploit these particular tragedies for their own almost evangelical purposes—and I think that the Spanish inquisitors would have envied their religious zealotry on this issue. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, the climate has always been changing, for over 650,000 years. We've had seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, and for the last 7,000 years we have been in this current climate phase. Does the climate change? Absolutely. Do I think that climate is impacted by human activity? Most probably. But for those opposite to again use these disasters to try and make some political capital is quite appalling. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know every single person in this place wants to leave the world, and certainly the environment, in a better place than it was when we inherited it, but not at the cost of energy security, affordability and Australian jobs today. We have to be cognisant of our environment and how best to protect it, but it cannot be at the expense of Australians' livelihoods and their standard of living. This chamber and this place cannot be guided by the blind ideological zealotry that those on the crossbenches—in this case the Greens—display. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, this government has set strong, responsible and achievable emissions reduction targets. We understand that there is a dilemma at play here. We do need—and we on this side absolutely accept the need—to transition to a lower emissions future whilst still providing affordable and secure energy for hardworking, everyday Australians and their families, a concern that those opposite clearly do not have. Rather than being guided by blind ideology and always being on the watch for consequences that are sometimes of biblical proportions—plagues, floods and things that have been predicted for 2,000 or 3,000 years—</span>

                  </a>  I rest my case, Mr Acting Deputy President. They can't even allow other people speaking on this issue to be heard in silence. They have to shout us down because they don't like hearing what we think about what they're doing. But, rather than being guided by blind ideology and always, as I said, being on the watchout for consequences of biblical proportions—signs that the world is about to end, plagues, floods, pestilence—those on this side take a much more responsible approach. We do want to improve our environment, we do want to reduce our emissions, but not at the cost of all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia produces just 1.3 per cent of global emissions, as my colleague Senator Macdonald is fond of pointing out in this chamber. We do believe it is important, which is why we've joined the global response to climate change. It is why Australia and this government ratified the Paris Agreement in November 2016. Australia does make a strong contribution to the negotiations and implementations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Sometimes I think that's why those opposite get so, so evangelical about this whole issue—they can't stand the fact that other people actually care about the environment and want to do something, but, again, not at all costs and not to the cost of all Australians, to their jobs and to their livelihoods and affordability. They're always talking about affordability, but the direct implications of their berserk and bizarre policy of having renewable energy at all costs at 12 per cent and increasing it when we don't have the adequate base power is impacting on all Australians.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231199" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I rise also to speak on this matter of public importance from Senator Whish-Wilson on the devastating storms and floods in South Asia and the Americas and the threat posed to Australia's natural resources. It calls for urgent action on global warming. It is a topic of debate with which we on this side have no issue. We have long stood for urgent action on global warming. It is important for Australian households and businesses and it is vital for people living in areas of our world who face a high frequency of natural disasters. But I do wonder where would this debate be if in 2009, before Senator Whish-Wilson and I were in this place, his predecessors Senator Milne and Senator Bob Brown had supported the original Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Climate change was an urgent policy area in 2009, which is why we introduced the Clean Energy Future package—to provide a mechanism that would ensure prices were affordable, to ensure our electricity infrastructure was reliable and to ensure that we promoted technology that is sustainable, low carbon and, where possible, carbon free. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a tragic debate that has plagued this nation for the past decade, and it remains an urgent policy area now in 2017. But, of course, when the Greens did support Labor on climate change action in 2011, the mechanism within the legislation to reduce carbon pollution was almost identical to that in the earlier 2009 bill. With a delay of two years, all that was achieved was the creation of space for Mr Abbott to launch his dangerous, ill-informed scare campaign—a scare campaign that his former senior adviser Peta Credlin admitted this year was all about politics and nothing about economics or the environment. It is important to point out the delay of two years enabled Mr Abbott to take the leadership and commit the next five years to the repealing of the carbon price. However, he failed to replace it with any credible climate change or energy policies after it was repealed. So, when the Greens get up in this place and say we must take urgent action on climate change, I agree, but I remind them of their ideological move in 2009, when they were unable to accept a proposal that would have had the support of all Labor and the majority of the coalition. No, that just wasn't good enough for them. The failure to legislate for the CPRS back then is a big part of the reason we are where we are in this country now, and it set in train the climate change policy calamity of the years to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of the political history, this is a timely matter of public importance. With the destruction we've seen in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, the Caribbean and the southern United States, urgent action is desperately needed both to mitigate the impacts of climate change and to limit climate change itself. In the week that the Turnbull government is seeking to strongarm AGL into selling or keeping open the Liddell power station and in the week that the National Party passed a motion at its national conference to end all subsidies to renewable energy, we're presented with this matter of public importance on urgent action on climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the wording of this MPI is a little hard to understand, I commend Senator Whish-Wilson for including both the devastating floods in South Asia as well as the hurricane in the Caribbean and southern United States. Too often the debate is focussed on Australia and our immediate allies, when natural disasters know no borders and when millions of people in less developed countries face homelessness, loss of livelihoods and, indeed, loss of life. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> yesterday, Peter Hartcher, wrote an article, 'Five big global crises that got worse while the world watched Hurricane Irma'. Tucked in at No. 5 was climate change. Mr Hartcher wrote: 'Climate change gathers force.' He said that three climate scientists from <span style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>wrote: 'The strongest storms are getting stronger.' They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... it is not likely to be a coincidence that almost all of the ... hurricanes on record ... have occurred over the past two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, it is now possible to confidently attribute certain weather events and natural disasters directly to climate change. Rephrasing that, we can now attribute the incidents of an individual natural disaster to climate change. What does that mean? Simply, it means we need to act. We need to act now. The old saying, 'You can't attribute any single extreme global event to global warming,' is indeed a mark of the past because the science has moved on and, to be frank, the time for debate has expired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In South Asia, entire villages remain under water and 40 million people are trying desperately to rebuild their lives. Forty million people—that's basically twice our population; two times the population of Australia—have spent over a month with their villages under water, their crop lands destroyed, no access to clean water and nowhere to bury their relatives and friends who have passed away. In the Caribbean, 34 people are known to have passed away. While fewer people are affected than in South Asia, the stories of devastation are similar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not without threat. Our cyclones and wildfires are getting more intense and more frequent, and many of our near neighbours in the Pacific are already facing permanent displacement. There has been no pause in climate change, no slowdown in temperature rises and no reduction in natural disasters, and yet there has been complete inaction from the government. Yes, they went to Paris and they signed up to the Paris agreement. Yes, they maintained that Australia must comply with our international obligations. But they failed to see the huge benefits, both economically and environmentally, that can flow to Australia from having strong action on climate change. They go to the opening of a renewable energy project and pretend to support the workers there, but they offer no support when they come back to Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paris agreement is our world's first comprehensive climate agreement. It's the culmination of decades of negotiations and decades of scientific research. The Paris agreement has three aims: holding the increasing temperatures below two degrees, increasing our ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and improving financing pathways for low greenhouse gas emissions energy development. For Australia to meet our obligations under the Paris agreement, we need a government that is willing to act; a government that's capable of reaching a compromise; a government that puts the planet and people at the forefront; a government that will admit that it was wrong in 2013 when it repealed the carbon price without replacing it with any legal mechanism to ensure that Australia tackles climate change; and a government that will admit that it was wrong in 2013 when it left Australia without a path to help industry, households and businesses reduce emissions. We have a government that won't introduce policies that give Australia a chance of making our contribution to holding the increasing temperatures below two degrees; a government that isn't interested in supporting Australians and the people of our region to adapt to climate change; and a government that is deeply divided over finding ways to finance and build new low-emissions technology and renewable energy technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for Mr Turnbull to show some leadership on climate change; stop the cheap, baseless politics made famous by his predecessor, Mr Abbott; pull his rogue junior partner into line; enact a sector-wide energy policy that will ensure that prices are affordable for Australian households and businesses; and ensure we have an energy system that is reliable, sustainable and promotes new low-carbon and carbon-free technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is offering to work with the government to find middle ground here and set a place in the future for a credible low-carbon energy policy—a suite of policies on climate change to ensure that we do our bit to reduce carbon emissions, that we are able to adapt and manage the devastating impacts of the disasters that we know have been caused naturally, and that there are appropriate incentives in place to see the rollout of renewable energy technology. The matter of public importance today is timely, and it's vital that we see this debate both in terms of Australian households and businesses and in terms of the natural disasters around the world, because they are increasing in severity, they are increasing in frequency and they are directly related to climate change. We need leadership from this Prime Minister on what was once a central tenet of his political purpose, leadership from Mr Turnbull that is sorely lacking. We need urgent action on climate change in this country. Labor have consistently said that we will work with the government to achieve a lasting solution, but we need the government to come to the table and take this matter seriously.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  It seems that the mantra of the Greens party is 'never let a natural disaster go to waste'. While disaster footage beams into our living rooms on the 24/7 media cycle, they make sure that it comes with the general complaints of: 'See, I told you so! The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are imminent unless all you little people out there change your ways, repent and live a life of green virtue and subsistence.' In times gone by, it was the bloke with the sandwich board on the corner that was caricatured in all the movies saying, 'The end is nigh!' and it was because of his religious conviction. Now we've got a religious conviction of a different form, and it resides within the Greens. When hurricanes form or hit, they blame it on global warming. When bushfires strike, they blame it on global warming. When there's too little rain or snow, they blame it on global warming. When there's too much rain or snow, they blame it on global warming. But they won't explain why the Bureau of Meteorology makes temperature records disappear to suit the mantra that has been emanating from the politically correct for far too long. They have record hot, record cold, record dry, record wet—it doesn't matter, because it's all the responsibility of mankind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only real threat to Australia's plentiful natural resources is the Greens and their growing band of useful zealots. At every turn, they try to prevent us from digging up our vast coal, gas and uranium resources. When we're lucky enough to bring them to the surface, we're not allowed to use them in this country, according to the Greens; we have to send them off overseas for someone else to use. That only prevents us, including the elderly and the infirm, from using warmth in winter and accessing cool in summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest mad green changes, rushed through parliament yesterday with the assent of the few Libs and Nats who bothered to even know what they were voting on, will begin to phase out the engines we typically use to boat, to fish, to dirtbike, to mow or to blow leaves with. This is the green agenda coming to life in this place. These crazy, obsessive busybodies are a threat to not just our natural resources but, increasingly, our enjoyment and our way of life. There seems to be no stopping the madness and zealotry of this Greens ideology, which seems to harbour and incubate most effectively within five to 10 kilometres of our larger central business districts and, increasingly, in our school system. These are the real threats to our resources and our very existence. They should be ashamed of their misuse and abuse of natural disasters, which have a real and catastrophic effect on many individuals, for their base political games. This place deserves better. Australia deserves better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for International Development and the Pacific</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  The storms and floods in South Asia and the Americas have devastated and displaced millions of people. We extend our condolences to the victims, and our thoughts and prayers are with them. The impacts of hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia continue to be felt in Mexico, the Caribbean and the United States, compounded of course by the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that struck Mexico. In South Asia, heavy rain during the monsoon season has resulted in widespread and significant flooding and landslides across Nepal, Bangladesh and India.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has responded by providing $2 million to the international relief effort, including $1 million through our humanitarian partnership with Australian non-government organisations and $1 million through the World Food Programme. Our assistance will deliver emergency shelter, food, clean water and health care for those who have been affected by the disaster. Our contribution to the World Food Programme will enable it give assistance to almost 6,000 children under the age of five and over 1,500 pregnant and nursing mothers for moderate and acute malnutrition in the worst-affected areas. In addition to this support, Australia is providing essential hygiene supplies and vital health services to over 6,000 women and girls. Australia commends the government of Nepal for its leadership in coordinating response efforts across the country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister for International Development and the Pacific, I want to say that the Australian government is committed to supporting nations in our region to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters, and to be able to do this themselves to the greatest extent possible. So I say to Senator Urquhart: can you please get your facts correct before you make wrong assertions? Of course, why let the facts get in the way of spin and a few lies!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our region, the Australian government is working very hard. We live in one of the most disaster-prone areas of the world. Seven out of 10 of the most disaster-prone countries are in our region. So we are working in a whole range of different ways, especially across the Pacific, to build the important resilience that communities need to meet the next disaster. And that includes helping remote Pacific communities diversify their crops to help them respond better following natural disasters. It includes providing scholarships and education, supporting our NGO partners and deploying technical assistance through mechanisms such as the Australian Civilian Corps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has also launched a new $50 million Australian humanitarian partnership to assist Pacific countries and communities better prepare for and manage disasters. Support for strengthening resilience in the Pacific includes: $33 million over five years in climate and weather services; $17 million over seven years in disaster and climate risk governance; and $2.3 million over two years to assist countries to better access and manage global climate finance, including with the focus on the Green Climate Fund. In a challenging budget environment, we have increased our humanitarian funding by $60 million to almost $400 million, which includes an increase of $20 million in the emergency fund up to $150 million and an allocation of $32.2 million to strengthen Australia and our region's preparedness to respond to disasters.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During a response, we work closely with governments and partners to ensure our efforts meet their needs and supports local action. Australia was also the first and one of the largest supporters when Tropical Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu in March 2015. It caused 11 deaths, impacted almost 200,000 people and resulted in $600 million in damage. In the wake of Pam, we committed a $50 million package of assistance, which included: an initial $15 million for immediate relief and early recovery; a further $35 million to support longer term recovery and reconstruction, including aiding economic recovery and repairing and rebuilding critical infrastructure and restoring health and education facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was also the largest contributor to the response to Tropical Cyclone Winston, which hit Fiji in February 2016, causing 44 deaths and impacting over half a million people. Our $35 million assistance package included an initial recovery of immediate relief of $15 million. The rest of it will support longer term recovery and reconstruction to rebuild schools, repair and rebuild health facilities, restore water and sanitation services, and rebuild and repair damaged markets and accommodation facilities for vendors—75 per cent of whom are women.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing over $100 million through bilateral and global partnerships for disaster risk reduction programs. In 2017-18, we will invest $200 million to support the government's five-year $1 billion commitment to addressing climate change. This will support developing countries' climate actions to, most especially, build resilience. Additionally, at last year's Pacific Islands Forum meeting Prime Minister Turnbull announced $300 million over four years for building climate resilience in the Pacific. We are also pleased to support Fiji as part of its COP23 Presidency with a contribution of $6 million—again, demonstrating our commitment to the framework for resilience building and building partnerships in our region.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Irrespective of what one's views are on the issue of climate change, the reality is that in our region we need to deal with the next cyclone; the next climate event which will have catastrophic consequences. The Abbott government committed Australia to a 26 to 28 per cent target as part of our commitments under the Paris agreement, in accordance with a domestic agenda, and the Turnbull government is continuing to work to meet these targets. Our focus is on building practical, day-to-day resilience building.</span>

When exactly will it be that the penny drops that they have messed this up, and not just a little bit but in a really big way? I wonder this because I am genuinely curious about what more they need in terms of proof of human-induced climate change. Is it scientific proof that they need? For decades now, we've had scientific consensus about the nature and causes of climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">James L Powell, Executive Director of the National Physical Science Consortium, reviewed more than 24,000 peer-reviewed papers on global warming that were published in 2013-14 and, of those, only five reject the reality of rising temperatures or the fact that human emissions are the cause. Maybe scientific evidence isn't enough. Maybe the hard right don't really trust the boffins. Maybe what the hard right need to hear is consensus amongst the hard-nosed element of the business community. Well, the Australian business community is pretty much united in its view that climate change is real and we need to act. Let's have a look at what BHP says—the favourite of the coalition. They state:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our position on climate change</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We accept the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change … assessment of climate change science, which has found that warming of the climate is unequivocal, the human influence is clear and physical impacts are unavoidable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's very promising. What else do they say? They talk about their approach and say: 'We believe an effective policy framework should include a complementary set of measures, including a price on carbon, support for low-emissions technology and measures to build resilience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">BHP was one of a whole range of companies, NGOs and community groups that came out this year in support of an EIS, which is Labor's preferred policy. But, as you can see from the debate this year, calls to action from the business community aren't actually enough. They are not enough to move the hard right of the coalition. Maybe they are men who like to see things with their own two eyes. Maybe they don't want to trust models and projections. Maybe they will believe we need to act when we see the effects of climate change happening in the real world. Well, we are there already. We are starting to see the physical phenomena that were predicted by the scientific models. We are seeing melting sea ice. We are seeing an increased incidence of natural disasters, perhaps like having two of the most powerful storms on record hit the US in just two weeks. We are seeing higher than average temperatures consistently and many more severe heat events. All of that leaves you wondering what exactly would be the standard of proof required. Where is there left to go? Will these people only accept the need for action on climate if the sea is lapping at their door? By that stage, it will be too late. All of it would be comic if it weren't sad. The Liberal and National parties have hijacked this country's climate policy and they've stopped us taking real and necessary action. That inaction has costs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've talked a lot about energy in this chamber recently. In part, that is because four years of inaction is starting to bite. You can only get away with not acting on things for so long. Eventually the cracks start to show. The government's refusal to have a real policy on energy didn't bring things to a crashing halt right away—not straightaway—but it did cause a slowdown in investment. Four years later, in the government's fifth year in office, we can see the costs that come with that: ageing infrastructure, higher power bills, higher emissions. We are fast approaching a similar point with the physical risks of climate change. This won't happen all at once, because it never does. But, slowly and gradually, we will be seeing events like Hurricanes Harvey and Irma occurring more and more frequently. The government are doing nothing about it. They have no plan, no credible policy and, seemingly, no-one cares. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government might not recognise the risk, but business does. It is becoming standard for big Australian companies to have policies that manage climate risk, and that's because they recognise that the physical effects of climate change pose real risks to their businesses. What does one of Australia's very, very big banks, Westpac, say about it? They say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Despite the commitment to limit global warming to two degrees, climate change will still cause shifts in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Communities may experience weather events that they are unfamiliar with or for which they are not prepared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've got a whole policy about adjusting their business model to deal with the reality of a warming world and what it will do to their market. Telstra, the biggest telecommunications company in Australia, says: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather can damage and disrupt our infrastructure and operations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This, in turn, can affect customer service and have wider financial, health and safety implications. We are committed to better understanding the risks posed by climate change to our infrastructure and people, and identifying action to strengthen the climate change resilience within our business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last little while, there's been a sort of allegation that AGL is only taking the decisions it's taking because it has been infiltrated by a single person who once had a relationship with the Labor Party. But, when you look at the range of actions being taken by the largest businesses in Australia, you see a consistency in their approach, which is to recognise that climate change is real and to recognise that it has very real and worrying impacts on business models and to start to work out how to respond to that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Transurban, a big manager of transport infrastructure across the country, conducted a series of climate change risk assessments for many of their major projects to assess the potential impacts of a range of climate change scenarios, looking at 2040, 2070 and 2090. The risks they were interested in included: the effect of potential extreme weather events; indirect risks such as the increased risk of power supply interruptions due to heatwaves; and the effect on the expected lifetime of infrastructure due to increased temperatures, heatwaves, rainfall and storm surges. If you manage a whole lot of kit and you manage stuff that is made of concrete, you need to start thinking about what it will mean to have very, very hot days. You need to start thinking about whether that infrastructure is designed to cope with very, very heavy rainfall events which produce much larger levels of run-off than anyone ever predicted when they were building transport infrastructure just a decade ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most exposed sectors, however, is the insurance sector. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warns that over time the adverse effects of climate change could threaten economic resilience and financial stability, and insurers are currently at the forefront. ClimateWise is a coalition of 29 insurers. It includes the industry's biggest names: Allianz, Swiss Re, Zurich and Lloyds. Last year, they issued a report looking at the impact of climate change on their industry, and the outlook isn't good. The report said—and these are big numbers:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since the 1950s, the frequency of weather-related catastrophes, such as windstorms and floods, has increased six-fold. As climate-related risks occur more often and predictably, previously insurable assets are becoming uninsurable, or those already underinsured further compromised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are serious warnings from people who are in the business of assessing risk, and they are telling us that we have a problem. But no-one on the other side of the chamber is listening. The chairman of the Global General Insurance at Aviva said the insurance industry's role as society's risk manager is under threat. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our sector will struggle to reduce this protection gap if our response is limited to avoiding, rather than managing, society's exposure to climate risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People, we have a problem. The complacency with which the coalition approach this issue is extraordinary. It's not just the environment groups, it's not just the opposition, it's not just the scientists warning them; it is business. Business is telling them that it is time to act, but, constrained by the coalition's hard-right partners, they are failing to do so.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise with enormous pride to say of the Greens' MPI today: what a flog. The Greens have no understanding, let alone any deep understanding, because they rely on opinions, not data. I'll say it again: the Greens have no understanding, let alone any deep understanding, because they rely on opinions, not data. That is why the Greens cannot withstand scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider recent hurricanes in the North Atlantic and North America. Senator Whish-Wilson's recent claims have been dishonest. Firstly, I want to honour the sad loss of life in the North Atlantic. But, then, I want to say the following facts. In the 10 years from 2007 to 2016, there were 10 hurricanes in the North Atlantic-North America area. In the 10 years from 1950 to 1959, there were 18—almost double. In the 10 years from 1910 to 1919, there were 21—slightly more than double the latest 10 years. And in the 10 years from 1880 to 1889, there were 27 hurricanes in that region—almost three times the current level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's consider the hurricanes that actually make landfall. In the last 12 years, there were none—zip, zero. Strong land-falling cyclones are still declining over the last 120 years even after cyclone Irma. That is why NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, and the UN IPCC itself—that corrupt body—in its latest reports all admit that hurricane activity is decreasing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at something else. The Greens don't seem to be worried about deaths. Deaths per year per million population in the USA have deceased from almost nine per million people in 1900 to almost two in 1920 and to almost zero in 2010. They've gone from almost nine deaths per million people per year in 1900 to almost zero in 2010. These are facts—hard, measured data. North America's largest hurricane tragedy was in the Galveston hurricane where thousands died.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the empirical evidence shows that there is no change in rainfall or flooding frequency, flooding severity or flooding duration. The floods in Brisbane in the 1890s were greater by far than the floods in any recent period in Brisbane. Drought severity, frequency and duration are lower now than in the past. Snowfall shows no changes. Temperature shows no changes—and I will come back to that. Ocean alkalinity shows no changes—that is the pH level. It's alkaline not acidic, as alarmists like to claim. Ocean alkalinity shows complete uniformity. Sea levels show nothing unusual. Polar ice caps are increasing in the Arctic and fluctuating naturally in the Arctic. There are no changes occurring in climate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So consider the Greens' implicit warming claimed in their MPI—their last two words were 'global warming'. Let's consider temperatures. In the last 22 years—that's more than half the satellite record, and that's known to be by far the most accurate record for measuring tropospheric, atmospheric temperatures—more than half the temperature records in satellite measurements have shown no warming; no warming at all. In the last 160 years, the longest temperature trend was from the 1930s to 1976—40 years of, wait for it, cooling. And that was at a time when humans increased markedly their production of carbon dioxide. But it cooled. In the 1880s and 1890s in Australia, they were warmer than today; fact. The medieval warming period was warmer by far than today globally. The Roman warming period, 1,000 years or so before the medieval warming period, was warmer again. So there is no warming. In the absence of warming, we heard the claims of 'global warming' morph to 'global climate change'. And now we hear the term 'extreme weather'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO has made three presentations to us since I entered the Senate, and we have torn apart every one of them. I will be speaking more to that in the near future. The CSIRO cannot, in response to our request, prove anything unprecedented in climate. What's more, in the first of their presentations they admitted there is no danger. More to come from that. But I want to get through and discuss the ramifications of this. What the Greens are claiming by distorting the science is anti-human. The reality is that as a result of hydrocarbon fuels and human creativity we have built levies and dams—until the Greens arrived. We can't build them any more in Australia. We have better building codes and better zoning, and we are dropping subsidies for insurance. The data shows that human fatalities have decreased and are continuing to decrease. That's the reality. The fact is that ignorance and deceptions kill. And the poor in India and the poor in Australia pay. That is why the Greens' position is anti-human. I am fiercely pro-human. That's why I devoted nine years to understanding the science, getting the empirical scientific evidence and understanding cause and effect. That is why I remain pro-human.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, can I just share some facts with you—some real facts. The floods in South Asia are the region's worst floods for 40 years, with a metre of rain falling over some areas in the space of days. There are 40 million people affected in Nepal, India and Bangladesh. Hurricane Harvey was a one-in-25,000-year storm. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are going to cost in clean-up about $100 billion each.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next fact is that there is absolutely no doubt that the intensity of these storms and the frequency of intense storms are a clear signal of global warming. The science is crystal clear. This is what we experience with 1.3 degrees of warming, and we are on track to four degrees of warming. As Bill McKibben said so eloquently in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> yesterday:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Maybe it was too much to expect that scientists' warnings would really move people. ... Maybe it's like all the health warnings that you should eat fewer chips and drink less soda, which, to judge by belt-size, not many of us pay much mind. Until, maybe, you go to the doctor and he says: "Whoa, you're in trouble." Not "keep eating junk and some day you'll be in trouble", but: "You're in trouble right now, today. As in, it looks to me like you've already had a small stroke or two."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in trouble. These hurricanes and storms tell us so, let alone in Australia the death of the Great Barrier Reef and that the climate of Australia's wheat-growing areas is heating to the climate of the central deserts. We ignore this climate catastrophe at our peril.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our government has no plan. They just want to prop up the clunker of a coalmine—they are falling over themselves to subsidise the Adani coalmine, because the private sector won't touch it because coalmining is an outdated, destructive, dying industry. Then they belittle and ridicule anybody who dares to call out the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, on climate-destroying coal, are sitting on the fence. They need to rule out support for the Adani coalmine. They can't have it both ways. They can't be concerned about global warming on the one hand and wave through the development of the biggest coalmine in Australia's history on the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remain optimistic. We're going to kick this science-denying government out of office and we can swiftly move to a clean future for us all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  I join this debate and echo the words of Senator Fierravanti-Wells. I express my concern and sorrow to those who have been affected by disasters recently and across time immemorial. I'm disappointed that the Greens would use these human tragedies to try to make some cheap political points, as they continue to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to observe these debates. I don't always agree with Senator Roberts. His view is his own view, but is, it appears to me, a more scientific view than that of anyone else who speaks in these particular discussions. But what I'm interested in is this. When someone like Senator Roberts has a different view from Senator Rice, Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Whish-Wilson, they're treated with disdain and giggling fits and the putting-down of anyone who doesn't happen to follow their ideology. Senator Roberts made some valid points. He quotes the facts of cyclones. I saw this years ago. He has actually said when the cyclones hit, and yet the Greens would tell you that this is a new phenomenon. I remember when Yasi hit the Greens said, 'This is the worst cyclone to hit Australia since 1917.' Now Senator Rice says, 'These are the worst floods to hit South-East Asia for a long time'—40 years. What happened before those 40 years? There were floods of that magnitude and there have been at all occasions. Certainly, with the media and social media the way it is, we're more aware of these disasters when they happen. Senator Roberts gives the facts. The Greens will never dispute those because they can't. They just try to belittle the deliverer of the message.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I never enter into the debate of whether human activity is causing climate change. The climate is, of course, changing. There's no doubt about that; no-one can deny that. I never enter that debate because I don't have that scientific knowledge, but neither does anyone else in this room, and neither does everyone else at the UBC—the Ultimo Broadcasting Corporation, which used to be called the ABC. They don't have the facts either; they don't have the scientific knowledge. They just mouth the platitudes of others who have a particular agenda, and the Greens are amongst them. The Greens could not tell you about the science themselves; they just mouth the platitudes that someone has told them. I continue to ask them and they never answer me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is doing its bit. We're reducing our emissions and we help with disaster resilience—not climate resilience; disaster resilience—particularly in the Pacific. Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. If the world's emission of carbon is what's causing climate change—which it is, according to the Greens—then I ask the Greens: why are you so determined to destroy Australia's industry and our standard of living by even further reducing the emissions of carbon?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I keep raising the point that they won't tell me what impact 1.2 per cent will have on the changing climate of the world—but Dr Finkel did. I asked Dr Finkel: if we shut Australia down, if we reduce Australia's emissions by 1.2 per cent, what impact would that have on the changing climate of the world? Dr Finkel said—and it's on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>—'virtually none'. The Greens are in here every day saying, 'Cut Australia's jobs; do away with manufacturing; do away with motor vehicles; do away with everything that has a carbon emission because it's going to kill the Barrier Reef,' yet Dr Finkel says that it will have virtually no impact on the changing climate of the world. The Greens bring lie, after lie, after lie to this debate—as they do with everything. We just heard a Greens senator say that the Barrier Reef is dead. That is a direct and outright lie. The Barrier Reef is not dead; it is brilliant. There are parts of it in some condition, but the Barrier Reef continues.</span>

It needs a reality check. Start answering those questions that Senator Roberts puts to you. I don't know whether he has the knowledge, but he has the facts on the cyclones and the floods. They're not new; they've happened all the time through the world's evolution, and they will continue to happen. They are a natural impact.

                  </a>  Of course, Mr Acting Deputy President. The coalition used to claim to be the party of market forces but, under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, they have embraced socialism. They have introduced export controls on gas; they want to spend $1 billion of taxpayer money subsidising the Adani coalmine; they want to use taxpayers' money to build and bail out old coal-fired power stations; and, of course, they have run a mile from market-based mechanisms for pricing carbon, which even the Prime Minister once crossed the floor to support. The one thing the energy industry says it wants is certainty, but, far from certainty, all it has from this government is chaos—all the coalition has given the industry is chaos. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take a closer look. It started with former Prime Minister John Howard, who gave us the Renewable Energy Target in 1997, but he raged against the price on carbon right up until 2006. As the 2007 election approached, John Howard supported an ETS, but post election the Liberals dumped it—for a while, at least, until Brendan Nelson unambiguously supported pricing carbon. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, of course, supported an ETS right up until—well, then he didn't. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, forever the contrarian, even supported a price on carbon just because Malcolm Turnbull didn't, but, soon after he became opposition leader, Tony Abbott opposed all carbon pricing and admitted he was just a bit of a weathervane. Then, as Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, after ripping up the carbon price, gave us the Renewable Energy Target, which we still have today. The coalition has been all over the shop when it comes to climate policy and energy policy, but where have they settled? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have settled for socialism. They will outsource health and education spending—all those essential services—but they want to insource the construction and maintenance of coal-fired power stations. They are socialists. We now see those in the National Party have become the coal communists. For years I have sat here and been lectured about the inefficiency of the public sector by the coalition in this place, and here we have Fidel Frydenberg and Castro Canavan— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This inquiry was different to others that have involved the Indian Ocean territories because it specifically looked into the Indian Ocean territories from a broader strategic perspective. The committee held five public round-table style hearings: two in Canberra and three in the Indian Ocean territories. Earlier this year, the committee undertook meetings with local communities on Christmas Island, West Island and Home Island. The committee inquired into the strategic importance and we investigated the changing regional security environment and security contingencies; Defence capabilities in the territories and associated infrastructure development; the scope of maritime, air and other cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners; and impacts on local communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia today, many people associate the region with Australia's defence and broader border protection. What many don't know is that the Indian Ocean territories have a history of strategic importance to the military, because of the access point to the Indian Ocean. In a submission to the committee, Mr Julian Yates gave a historical account of the strategic importance of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which first became significant in World War I. West Island was used as an operating base for the British Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force for attacks on Japanese forces in Burma, Sumatra, Java and Singapore. During World War I and World War II, Cocos (Keeling) Islands were used for its phosphate resources, a fact that had them under Japanese attack in World War II. Christmas Island was also very important strategically in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In more recent times, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stated that a secure and stable Indian Ocean region is crucial for Australia's national security and prosperity, particularly noting the economic interests of shipping routes for exports and imports. One witness told the inquiry that Australia needs a military presence on Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands to defend and maintain its interest in the territories, adding that the Indian Ocean territories could play a role in defeating organised crime. The change from its historical role also reflects the changing dynamic in the region. Competing world powers are increasing their levels of activity, and with this come security challenges in our region. The changing dynamic of the region raises security issues around transnational crime, irregular maritime migration and terrorism. For this reason, the committee supports Australia's ongoing engagement with partners in the region to address these security challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is involved in various international forums relating to the Indian Ocean territories, which gives it an opportunity for diplomatic engagement, finding common ground on the interests and issues, and gaining a localised perspective on regional partnerships. Part of the regional cooperation can be addressed through the upgrade of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands airport runway. When giving evidence, Dr Malcolm Davis suggested that Australia may wish to consider whether reciprocal access to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands airport runway could be granted in the spirit of increased cooperation with India. The committee also received evidence from Dr Davis, who said that Australia should seek to further strengthen its relationship with Indonesia through further cooperation such as joint naval patrols in the Indian Ocean region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indian Ocean region is a diverse area of national and economic interests. Because of this, the committee recommends that the Australian government strengthen its engagement with Australia Indo-Pacific partners through existing regional forums and alliances that Australia currently participates in. The Department of Defence told the inquiry the Indian Ocean territories would be an effective place from which to deploy and support Australian Defence Force capability in the region in the form of humanitarian and disaster relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development noted the government's long-term strategic infrastructure to support the provision of local and state type government services in the region, including in water, wastewater, power, fuel supply and storage, airports, ports, health services, roads, community buildings and housing. Despite the department's plan, many people from the local Christmas and Cocos communities raised serious issues concerning infrastructure. Infrastructure projects like the Cocos islands airstrip and associated facilities, access to water on West Island, the crane and mooring facilities on Christmas Island, telecommunications infrastructure and the future of the Christmas Island immigration detention centre would all have a shared benefit to government, industry and local business interests. The inability to increase infrastructure funding on the island means that those projects have now built up, and this committee report recognises that. As I said, concerns were raised by members of the local communities on the islands about the need for infrastructure upgrades. The committee has recommended ongoing and extensive consultation with stakeholders and communities on long-term infrastructure solutions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The communities on both Christmas and Cocos islands are similar to all of our Australian communities, and they are culturally diverse and proudly Australian. The committee made a final recommendation that any government departments that wish to do further works on the island do so in genuine partnership with local communities, through consultation and action that meets the needs of the community. Underemployment and a lack of employment opportunities are certainly issues facing both these communities in the Indian Ocean territories. Mr Daniel Becker told the committee that the Cocos islands have a lot of underemployment because employment is dependent on intermittent activities. For example, there is a surge in employment when ships dock on the island to unload cargo. Jobseekers on Christmas Island are older and on the edge of retirement. The number of unemployed young people is low. Witnesses from the Chinese Literary Association stated that most young people from Christmas Island leave for mainland Australia due to lack of employment opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee noted the opportunity for local employment through the increased defence and border protection activities. These include surveillance, naval patrols, a military reserve or cadet unit and potential training exercises on Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Again the Cocos airstrip was raised as an industry-boosting solution. Mr Balmut Pirus commented that, if the airstrip on West Island could be further developed, it could create opportunities for more airlines to set routes to the islands, leading to increased tourism and employment for locals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was indeed a great honour to travel with the committee to the Indian Ocean territories and to hear the constituents of both Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands come forward with their solutions and their vision for the future of the Indian Ocean territories. I would like to thank the communities of Christmas Island, and Home and West islands, which make up the Cocos (Keeling) Islands group, for welcoming the committee, sharing their experiences, offering solutions and offering their hospitality, and a very special thankyou too to the residents of Christmas Island. I commend the report to the chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present report No. 466, the annual report of 2016-17. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased, as Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, to present this annual report for 2016-17. Those familiar with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit will know and appreciate that it is one of the parliament's oldest and most autonomous joint committees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016-17, the committee again sustained high-quality scrutiny of Commonwealth expenditure and public administration matters. Through 10 active inquiries, the committee examined matters contained in 18 Auditor-General reports, a 50 per cent increase in the number of reports reviewed compared to the previous year. Themed inquiries into key aspects of public administration were a feature of the committee's inquiry activities. These themes included Commonwealth procurement, Commonwealth infrastructure spending, Commonwealth grants administration and the Commonwealth performance framework. Submissions to the committee also increased significantly, with 111 received, compared to just 56 received in the previous year. The committee also continued its strong contribution to enhancing accountability and improving efficiency in public administration, making 17 recommendations to government. Responses by Commonwealth entities are expected within a six-month time period. In 2016-17, 39 government responses were received, and I am pleased to advise the Senate that 92 per cent of these government responses were submitted on time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reporting period also included the commissioning of an independent review of the Parliamentary Budget Office, which detailed 16 recommendations for the evolution of the work of the Parliamentary Budget Office as well as the appointment of a new Parliamentary Budget Officer, Ms Jenny Wilkinson, following the retirement of the Parliamentary Budget Office's first and only PBO, Mr Phil Bowen. I would like to reflect for a brief moment on the report of the independent review panel into the Parliamentary Budget Office, conducted by Dr Ian Watt AC and Mr Barry Anderson. I extend the appreciation of all the committee members for the great stewardship and the great and genuine consultation that both Dr Ian Watt and Mr Barry Anderson participated in as they conducted the independent review into the PBO. It is worth noting that, in the five years that the Parliamentary Budget Office has been in existence, this is the first genuinely independent review of the PBO. I think it's worth reflecting on the significant and positive contribution the Parliamentary Budget Office has made to our democratic practice in this country. In the covering letter that Dr Ian Watt and Mr Barry Anderson sent to me as chair in closing the independent review's report, Mr Ian Watt said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PBO has been a successful institutional development in Australian governance. It has made a good start as an organisation, and has filled a significant gap in Australia's public policy landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The PBO is regarded by stakeholders as an independent and non-partisan organisation that produces rigorous analysis relevant to public policy debate. This review has reached a similar conclusion. Notwithstanding this, we have made a number of recommendations that will help to improve the PBO's operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that's available to me, I want to share with the Senate the thematics that those 16 recommendations reflected on over four core theme areas. Those recommendations that were provided to us by Dr Ian Watt and Mr Barry Anderson cover four broad themes. The first is about ensuring that there is a level playing field for costings. The second is about ensuring that the accuracy of costings of policy, including election commitments, is the best possible and as accurate as possible. The third is about ensuring that there is transparency and public understanding of budget and fiscal policy settings. Finally, they provided two recommendations in regard to governance and resourcing issues relevant to the work of the Parliamentary Budget Office into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I thought it timely to conduct the independent review not just because it was the five-year mark, approximately, of the Parliamentary Budget Office but, because, as we were forewarned that Mr Bowen was embarking upon his retirement, it would be necessary for the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of representatives, in close consultation with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, to appoint the second Parliamentary Budget Officer. Before that person began their career—and I think we can expect the new Parliamentary Budget Officer to have as stellar and as a significant a contribution as Mr Bowen did—it was important that we got some independent eyes and independent analysis to review the work of the Parliamentary Budget Office and also to reset, if you like, some of the work and activity that the new Parliamentary Budget Officer might like to embark upon. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all the 16 recommendations, there is one recommendation that I think is particularly pertinent—and not only the workings of the parliamentary joint committee of public accounts and the Parliamentary Budget Office. I think it will bring a tremendous amount of insight into some of the debates that we are having in our country at the moment. When we have debates about future tax increases and government spending, when we think about the size and composition of government, when we think about its reach into state and territory governments, when we think about its reach into peoples' lives, what has been missing is the genuine regard that the community and key stakeholders and others have for the work of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> is a piece of work done by government and owned by government, and the responsibility for taking that piece of work, that <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span>, into the public domain is one for government. But what Dr Ian Watt and Mr Barry Anderson have suggested in their recommendations is that that might actually be an issue that is worthy of much closer consideration. When we are trying to find a trusted, independent, genuinely non-partisan set of analyses or records that try to give us a sense of what it is that we're actually working towards and what the challenges are that we are about to face or can expect to face as a nation, particularly around demographic change, how do we ensure that that piece of work gets the best possible authority in the public space of ideas? I'd argue that when a piece of work as significant as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> is owned by government sometimes we don't get the best of that report because people might view it through a partisan lens. Unfortunately, those people who are trusted with communicating the report may not be the best policy communicators. They may not even be the best political communicators. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Dr Ian Watt and Mr Barry Anderson said in their recommendations to the committee under the heading of 'Transparency and public understanding of budget and fiscal policy settings' was that it was important to 'improve the relevance' of the PBO's self-initiated work. Importantly, they said it was important to 'consider a possible evolution of its self-initiated work program' by ensuring that the PBO:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… has the capacity to further develop its longer-term analytic ability to allow consideration to be given to transferring responsibility for the next Intergenerational Report (scheduled for 2020)—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be a very brave government that, in the next two to three years, transfers the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> work to the PBO. But I genuinely think that if we are to start to move to a more mature debate in our country about how we meet the challenges of demographic change, how we meet the challenges of taxation and government spending and the reach of government, then it's important that we review and better place the work of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational</span><span style="font-style:italic;">report</span>, or the Treasury's <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> work, at the heart of that consideration. I'm one who thinks that, at the very minimum, we must have a conversation with ourselves about how we best do that and whether it should continue to be the domain of government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKENZIE:</span>
                    </a>  Yes. Good call, Senator O'Sullivan—except for the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. As opposition senators and government senators, we are tasked with ensuring that public finances administered by the Commonwealth government are accounted for. We have a very close relationship with the ANAO. We also have a very close relationship with the Parliamentary Budget Office. I know the chair of the committee has gone to the heart of that relationship, actually farewelling Mr Bowen, who's done some great work, and welcoming our new Parliamentary Budget Officer. The involvement of the committee in that selection process augurs well for coming years, with the committee and the PBO working together to strengthen the financial reporting mechanisms to parliament and, indeed, to the broader public, which is our role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I briefly wanted to touch on some of the work that the committee has been able to achieve over the past year. Sometimes, we get buried in our ANAO Defence procurement reports. A couple of our members are very, very passionate about this particular area of public expenditure. Even at our last hearing, the changes that have been made over time in reporting and accountability measures by the Defence Force in the spend of public money has been considerable, but there is a way to go in that particular area. I think of Ms Brodtmann's role and focus on that particular area of public policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on one of the reports that I appreciated being able to be involved in prosecuting—ANAO report No. 31. It's located on page 7 of our annual report. It goes to the administration of the Higher Education Loan Program debt and repayments. This report examined how we could account for the ballooning debt that HELP has been subject to. It is a mature program based on a solid foundation of collecting student loan debt through the income system. Nevertheless, it identified scope for the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Education and Training to make meaningful improvements to important aspects of the program's administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Audit No. 6 found that nine Commonwealth entities involved in the audit had made a solid start in implementing the requirements for the first corporate plan under the PGPA Act. This particular issue has consumed the committee both in the previous parliament and in this parliament in how our government departments are going to be moving to a more public, iterative process of implementing their corporate plans and how that will actually be reported back to parliamentarians and, through the parliament, back to the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One issue I raised was that the construction of the corporate plans and the reporting of changes was actually not going to be made in a timely enough manner for Senate estimates. So opposition senators who are keen to prosecute departmental spend and make sure that they are accountable to the outcomes identified within their corporate plans need to have that reported publicly in a timely manner so that that can be of use in Senate estimates. We were able to make those sorts of changes because the committee works in a bipartisan manner to improve the financial reporting of the departments of the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of ANAO reports, one of the other reports I was quite interested in was on the VET FEE-HELP scheme. We saw an increase in that loan book from $25.6 million in 2009 to $2.9 billion in 2015. That's quite an incredible jump, and it was as a result of inappropriate mechanisms and the program itself being set up in a way that almost encouraged those accessing the program to game the system. We heard horror stories, as the Labor plan rolled out, of vulnerable young people, vulnerable people in a range of communities, being offered iPads as inducements to sign up for education programs that they would never even attempt, let alone complete. It just goes to show that the Labor Party talk big, but, when it comes to actually implementing sound policy that achieves outcomes and is fiscally responsible, fail at every single measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing, because this program was aimed at assisting those very vulnerable people in our community who do need to engage in the vocational education and training sector to upskill and better improve their chances of getting a job and fulfilling their potential, if you like. Many of these people may not have finished year 12, and as they age, as they mature, they find that there is something that they want to engage in. They find the appropriate training course to give them those skills and they then seek a scheme that they can enter. That was the intent. Unfortunately, because of the way it was set up, because of the failure to set up appropriate checks and balances, this failed on every measure, which is incredibly disappointing not only from a financial perspective but also for those that were taken for a ride by those unscrupulous VET providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all thanks to the coalition government—which took measures to assist that scheme and, in the end, started from scratch and designed a scheme—that we will achieve the outcomes we need to have a skilled workforce in areas of shortage and that those students can be supported through milestones as they go on that educational journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do enjoy the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. I commend the annual report. And, for those of us that do get a bit busy, the ANAO reports can provide some really useful information to senators in the public policy areas that you're interested in and ensure what we all want, which is the responsible spending of public money. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge my colleagues Senator Williams and Senator McKenzie, who jointly were involved in the development of the reference. Senator McKenzie drove this process. Senator Williams and I joined the reference almost as an afterthought, I suspect. This reference was, I think, stimulated by events that occurred in the Barnawartha saleyards in Victoria. Knowing that Senator McKenzie is going to speak, I probably will refrain from spending too much time on that aspect of the report and its recommendations. I want to acknowledge the support of Labor, through the chairmanship of Senator Glenn Sterle. This was a difficult inquiry and a very long one—in fact, it spanned two parliaments. It is fair to say, and I am sure Senator McKenzie will visit on this, too, that we didn't always receive the level of cooperation and assistance from the industry stakeholders that one may have expected. I can place on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> that Senator Sterle did an exceptional job in chairing the committee as we navigated through some of those challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The early recommendations are to consider an inquiry into pre-sale and post-sale weighing in saleyards, to try to bring some consistency, particularly on the eastern seaboard, with respect to practices in saleyards. Again, I will yield that aspect of the report to Senator McKenzie, because I am sure she is going to touch on that, including the recommendations around what we have named 'the standards of practice in saleyards'. Again, I will yield to Senator McKenzie on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the recommendations is in relation to the operations and capability of AUS-MEAT, particularly in their role in oversighting objective carcass management in beef processing plants—a significant role, one that has been challenged by, I think, almost a majority of producers at one time or another. This is where the rubber meets the road—when it is determined what they will be paid for the carcasses of livestock they have sold to the works on what is called the grid. There are positives and negatives about the inspection of carcasses and I think it is fair to say that, in this particular case, over a long period of time there has been a collapse of trust and confidence between producers and processors that this process is as objective as they might like. It was often challenged. There were, and remain, reasonably inadequate options for producers to be able to themselves objectively assess and perhaps even challenge processors on some of the descriptions of their carcasses that resulted in payments that they thought were less than what they had wanted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The advent of technology coming into the meat processing sector, particularly the technology known as DEXA, a dual X-ray system, will allow processors to more accurately—now in the 90 per cent—assess what the meat yield is of a carcass. It will separate meat, bone and other, and this is a positive step in the right direction, even though there has been, I suppose, caution around how this technology is to be introduced. Nonetheless, anything that increases the prospect of objective carcass management in our processing plants in this $11-plus billion industry is a step in the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made recommendations that the operations and capability of AUS-MEAT be looked at by the minister, through the agriculture department, to see that they have adequate powers and that they are adequately resourced and that we ourselves can have oversight over their operations to see that they are doing the job to the best of their ability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two recommendations that I really want to focus on—and I'll leave the main interest to me until last. The final recommendation to government and to the minister was that they establish a joint government and industry task force to effectively review all aspects of the meat processing and the meat supply chain and production sector. I think this is very timely. The current structures that they operate in are complicated—relationships are complicated. There is disparity in power bases within the whole sector. Of course, they're working under operations that were put in place about 19 years ago in 1998 by the then Deputy Prime Minister and minister for agriculture, the Hon. John Anderson. It is almost overdue for that entire sector to be reviewed by this joint government and industry task force. It will be a skills-based task force if the recommendations are accepted. We anticipate it will take them some considerable period of time to do their work, as a comprehensive review in such a big industry and sector would be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me use the final time I have to speak about what I think is the key recommendation—or, certainly, which is up there with the top recommendations made in the report. It is for government to do virtually whatever it takes to support the establishment of a new peak industry body for cattle producers. Various numbers have been given to us over time of between 30,000 and 60,000 different producers in this country in the beef sector, ranging from small operators who might only have half a dozen livestock through to big family corporations and, in fact, public companies who oversight an industry that has, or ought to have, about 29 million head of stock at any time. We believe those numbers are down quite considerably due to the advent of droughts all over the country. But what is, I think, agreed to by everyone in the industry is that we need to beef up—if I can use that term—the peak industry body that—</span>

                    </a>  I thought it was a good pun, and it actually came to me spontaneously, Senator, so I'm very proud of it. We need to beef up the peak industry body that represents these producers. The advent of new technologies and legislation passed here—I think we all were involved in supporting the legislation—allow the peak body to find out who those levy payers are that, collectively, pay about $50 million plus a year into the Meat &amp; Livestock Australia for the support to the industry in research and development. This is about getting a peak industry body. I said at one of the inquiries: 'We'll know when we've arrived when members of the Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, and senators and other politicians in this place, break into a sweat when they hear that this peak body has arrived in the building to come and see them.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want it to be a powerful body. I want it to get its way on behalf of producers around the country. It needs to be a very transparent body. It needs to have its strength and its power embedded in a grass-roots movement within the industry. It needs to have a skills-based board that I personally believe needs to be renumerated. I don't care how much they have to pay the members of the board and the chairperson to administer this very important industry in agriculture and, indeed, to our whole national economy. It needs to make sure that its structure allows it to represent and reflect the ideals and the ambitions of producers all around the nation.</span>

This was a difficult report to structure. There was a lot of work and effort, and there were a lot of amendments and restructuring of the report as we got towards this tabling date. Their work, as is always the case, was first class.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to be here at the tabling of a report that has taken a long time to complete but was born of producers in the north-east of my home state of Victoria. The report comes at the end of the eighth inquiry into the red meat industry in the last 17 years. I too would like to acknowledge the work and time that has been invested in the inquiry and this final report by all involved. When it comes to producers in the north-east of Victoria and to the peak bodies, they have inundated us with over 120 submissions to inquiries over this period of time, and this time we had to get it right. I think Senator O'Sullivan, who's come on board as the Deputy Chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, has been absolutely diligent, steadfast and determined in making sure the report we have handed down today provides a clear pathway forward for the red meat industry, to end the rumours and insinuations that led us to set up the inquiry in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the notorious incident known as the Barnawartha boycott on 17 February 2015, when nine processors were no-shows at the first prime sale of the Northern Victoria Livestock Exchange, at Barnawartha, it's become clear, through evidence to this committee, that industry practices require a root-and-branch overhaul to restore fairness, transparency and accountability to a sector marred for years by conflicts of interest, allegations of collusion, intimidation and bullying. Whether it was in the public submissions, at the public hearings or at hearings conducted in camera, that was the evidence we heard, and I will stand by those words, as will Senator O'Sullivan. A couple of weeks ago we had the red meat peak bodies before us so we could ask what they thought about the ACCC inquiry recommendations, and they attempted to crab walk away: 'Nothing to see here, Senators. Not a problem! It's all a storm in the teacup, dear Senator McKenzie!' Well, the evidence stands. I would ask all those peak bodies and, indeed, anyone listening tonight with a concern in this area to go to the evidence to this committee, to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and the submissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee reports key areas of concern as outlined by submissions from processors, producers, community members and councils. There are seven recommendations, including a recommendation that the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources request Meat &amp; Livestock Australia to conduct 'a study into pre- and post-sale weighing to provide the southern industry with an evidence base on which to consider selling methods at saleyards'. This was a key concern to producers in my home state of Victoria and a key driver of the reason those processors didn't turn up. When we came to prosecute the issue within the Senate inquiry we relied on a piece of research from the 1980s. That something was a policy of the Victorian Farmers Federation—and I recognise it's not a policy of other livestock producers in other states—and that peak bodies took the levy, took the money, without one study being conducted on the efficacy of pre-sale versus post-sale weighing over that period of time, goes to the fundamental issue we are outlining here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key recommendation, which Senator O'Sullivan has spoken about, is to support the grass-fed cattle sector 'in its efforts to replace the Cattle Council of Australia with a transparent and accountable producer-owned body as the sector's peak industry council'. There is also a recommendation for revision of the MOU and the establishment of a government task force, which I encourage to consult widely. As we looked deeply into this area and this industry, we found one of the issues was that there were favourite people to talk to and favourite bodies to talk to. I would encourage this task force to be very robust and broad in its consultation processes over the coming two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I met with the Victorian Farmers Federation Livestock Group after the ACCC market report, which really was spurred by this Senate inquiry. Rod Sims, and the agricultural commissioner, Mick Keogh, when he came to our inquiry, said, 'Hang on; there's something wrong with that Barnawartha boycott.' They went and had a look and said: 'Yes, Senators, there is something wrong there. We need some concerted practices legislation in our competition law.' Well, this government's delivered that in the meantime so that the Barnawartha behaviour cannot occur again, or at least can be prosecuted in the current legislative environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there was enough of an issue for Rod Sims to say: 'Do you know what your first market inquiry will be as Agricultural Commissioner? It's going to be into the red meat industry.' So Mick Keogh and his officers brought down an ACCC report with 15 recommendations that really went to the heart of what this inquiry was all about: what is the impact on producer return from the lack of competition within the red meat sector? That was the heart of that ACCC report. A couple of weeks ago those peak bodies tried to walk away from those 15 recommendations. I would encourage and say: 'You might not have liked who was tasked to do the job, but we can talk about that.' Issues that were traversed included the fact that we don't need transparency around pricing and livestock agents not needing education, training and registering. Those issues were traversed as were complaints processes for producers and processors. Those 15 recommendations from the ACCC are fundamental to returning confidence and competition to the red meat industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For now, the committee have declined to entertain the suggestion that a binding code of conduct should be imposed; however, our report rightly notes that a code, industry-led or legislated, cannot be an open-ended pipedream. In this sense, the ACCC's recommendations offered the industry a framework that you can adopt as your own. When Mick Keogh wrote to our committee after the evidence from the peak bodies, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… RMAC is in a unique position in the industry. RMAC is the only organisation that regularly holds discussions with a wide range of industry participants and then advocates on behalf of members directly with the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC felt that RMAC was uniquely placed to facilitate discussions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Price grids was another contentious issue identified by the committee, the ACCC and the Victorian Farmers Federation. Yet, despite all the evidence presented, certain sectors in the industry—namely, the processors—don't think that price transparency is an issue for the industry. I do; I absolutely do. I think it's important to have that information available to producers to make decisions in a clear and transparent way. The producers were concerned about its potential impact to the market price and that it could potentially have an adverse or potentially opposite impact compared to the intention of the ACCC in asking an industry for greater price transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare that to evidence on transparency given to the committee—like the submission from the Shire of Campaspe, who submitted about the potential of misidentifying or distorting the value of a product during various stages of the supply chain. We had evidence from a producer who suggested that most producers wait for months for a kill date, and they only know the grid price days before the point of sale. He suggested that sometimes it was the case that, 'If you don't like the price, then you lose your booking,' and, 'If you don't like it, too bad.' That was a direct quote of his interaction with some of the processors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was particularly interested in the evidence from Australian Livestock &amp; Property Agents Association CEO Andrew Madigan, who seemed a little confused on the question of collusion in the industry. There's been a bit public commentary on that of late. Responding to a question on notice on 28 August, Mr Madigan said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At no stage did I say the following—that since the 1970s he had witnessed collusive behaviour at livestock sales, the committee might like to point out where this was said in evidence on 27th August 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'm really pleased to accommodate Mr Madigan. I will directly quote from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> of 27 August 2015. This is your quote, Mr Madigan:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In my experience I have seen buyers talk to one another—just have a little whisper. I have not heard what they have said. I have no proof of it, but I have seen it. They will go up and talk to one another. One will stop bidding and then walk away, and then they will buy the next pen. I have seen that, yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a direct quote. We've all seen that kind of behaviour and we've heard of that kind of behaviour. That is why I would encourage ALPA on an education training and registration program for the livestock agents to assist in that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the hardworking secretariat, Dr Thompson and her team. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues in the Victorian Farmers Federation Livestock Group, Leonard Vallance and Dave Picker, for their continual advice and support. To those producers who bravely stood up after the Barnawartha boycott and said for the first time publicly what we've known for decades has been going on: thank you, because we would not have had that ACCC inquiry and we would not have had this Senate report without you actually saying, 'Enough is enough; we have to have some accountability and transparency.' This is a billion-dollar industry and hundreds of thousands of Australians are employed in the red meat industry. We back you. Let's just clean it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The UHM Program is based on principles similar to out-of-home care, utilising the experience of State/Territory Government Child Welfare Authorities (SCWAs) as well as child welfare specialists and experienced carers from non-government organisations (NGOs).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">UHMs supported by SCWAs most commonly live in the community with either an adult relative, an assessed and approved unrelated adult caregiver, or an adult caregiver who has customarily adopted the child in their country of origin. Young people of an appropriate age, maturity and independence are also supported in independent living. Further, a small number are placed with caregivers who are specifically recruited, assessed and approved by the state for the purpose of caring for UHMs.</span>

These may include placement with an approved family or state-accredited foster family. if it is in the minor's best interests, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will support the UHM's care and welfare through a residential care placement with a Department of Immigration and Border Protection-contracted service provider.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A health assessment gives a medical practitioner the opportunity to undertake a holistic and systemic assessment of a child's health status and to consider actual or potential ongoing health or developmental care needs. However, on its own, a health assessment cannot guarantee that a child who needs follow-up care will receive that care, or that the provision of care will be coordinated rather than piecemeal. For very vulnerable patients, such as children in out-of-home care the need for effective care co-ordination is crucial. Therefore, this recommendation is not supported.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments are best placed to provide such care by employing expert, multi-disciplinary case managers to operate out of local public hospital units or other appropriate publicly funded centres. The case managers are required to have substantial skills in organising appropriate, coordinated health care and other services for the children. Just how complex the needs of these children can be is reflected by the fact many jurisdictions have established their own specialist services for children in out-of-home care that include child abuse assessment and treatment units that co-ordinate health services including forensic medical services, paediatric developmental assessments, psychosocial assessments, health screens, education, consultation and counselling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In June 2009 the Commonwealth Government increased the TILA payment from $1,000 to $1,500. From 1 January 2014, DSS introduced reforms that refocused eligibility back to the original target group of young people leaving formal care, with an additional requirement that there is a transition to independence plan in place and a case worker is involved. TILA can be paid in instalments so that the caseworker and young person can agree to receive smaller payments at appropriate times during their transition to independent living. TILA is now integrated with state and territory governments' leaving care supports so that it is complementary to the support that young people are receiving in living out of care from their jurisdiction.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The DSS review, conducted in 2015 and published in April 2016, aimed to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the new operational arrangements which commenced on 1 January 2014: In the main, the review found that the sector appreciated the 2014 reforms and the streamlining of the administration of TILA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The recommendations of the review called for improved communications, simplifying administration, driving demand for TILA, and amending Department of Human Services' payment notifications. The review also found that not all eligible young people exiting care claim TILA payments or claim the full amount. The average amount applied for is $1,350. DSS has been raising awareness of TILA amongst young people, caseworkers and jurisdictions through a communication strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">DSS has also made administrative adjustments to the TILA application process, clarified eligibility of young people and implemented a communication plan, all designed to increase awareness and uptake of TILA payments and payment notifications. The two step application process required caseworkers to first seek approval from DSS of the goods and services to be bought with TILA funds then a second application for payment to be made through the Department of Human Services' Unified Government Gateway (UGG). The main administrative change reduced red tape in applications through the removal of the first step application to DSS so that caseworkers now apply for a TILA payment directly to the UGG. DSS will consider a modest increase to the maximum TI LA payment as part of ongoing administrative reform to TILA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I made the reference to the community affairs committee, which I also chaired. I introduced the motion to refer this matter because we have a very poor situation with out-of-home care in Australia. In fact, one of the key issues that we looked at in this inquiry was the poor life outcomes of people leaving out-of-home care. Unfortunately, we haven't made much progress in that respect. One of the other key areas that we looked at, besides looking in general across the board at out-of-home care, was the fact that there's such a high number of Aboriginal children going into out-of-home care. In fact, the latest report from SNAICC, the national voice for Aboriginal children, shows that about ten times more Aboriginal children are going into out-of-home care than non-Aboriginal children. That figure is appallingly high and compares unfavourably with the number of children that were going into out-of-home care when the children were being taken when the stolen generations were occurring. The report also points out that a number of recommendations from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report from 20 years ago this year have not been implemented. I will come back to that issue shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad the government finally has responded to the community affairs committee report. I'm pleased with some of the response, but most, unfortunately, I'm not, because they're simply not being proactive enough in dealing with this issue of out-of-home care. The government disagrees with our recommendation to provide a separate Medicare item for children in out-of-home care to improve their access to health assessments and treatments. The government say they disagreed with that because they're concerned that it would be ad hoc. In their response, they largely dealt with the health assessment side of it rather than the treatment side and said that there are case managers and that would be better. That simply does not work, because the states don't have case managers to the degree to which this comment by the government implies. With the extraordinarily high number of children going into out-of-home care, they simply aren't getting individual attention. This was recommended by organisations and also, importantly, foster carers, who are looking after these children and who have problems accessing health services. In particular, this doesn't just talk about health assessments; it talks about treatments, including mental health treatments. I'm extremely disappointed that the government has squibbed on this and disagrees with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government notes a number of our recommendations, particularly those around the Third Action Plan of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children 2009–2020. The government puts a lot of emphasis on the Third Action Plan, and I wish I had as much confidence as it does that it'll be implemented. The Third Action Plan runs out in 2018, so it has not got that long to go. When we were carrying out this inquiry, we found many of the approaches that were recommended in the Second Action Plan hadn't been carried out. I think the government needs to be more proactive. One of the issues they note, for example, is increasing the allowance for young people transitioning out of care. I do acknowledge they've increased it slightly since we had the inquiry, but it needs to be increased more. One of the huge issues that came up is young people receiving post-care support to 21 years of age. At the moment, young people have to move out of care at the age of 18, and a lot of the very clear evidence we got showed that this is not long enough. Most young people these days do not leave care at 18. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I clearly remember somebody coming into my office, subsequent to us tabling this report, from CREATE, which does excellent work and presented excellent information to the inquiry. This person was a young care leaver trying to find work, but she couldn't find accommodation. She was under the age of 21. She said, 'Rachel, the key thing you spend your whole time on is trying to work out where you're going to sleep. Where will I be safe? Where will I have a roof over my head?' She said, 'I can't think about trying to find work, because I'm so worried about where I'm going to sleep tonight. I spend my energy doing that.' She was under the age of 21 and she had to leave the care system. That is simply not good enough. We need to lift our game and increase the resources to family services and therapeutic models of care, and evidence based evaluations and reunification. The government talks about that in its response and notes it. We simply aren't providing enough resources, enough family supports or enough early intervention supports. When the budget is cut, guess what the first thing is to be cut: early intervention services. We put lots of effort into the court system and the child-protection system, and into supporting kids in foster care, but not into their families in the first place. This is particularly important for the number of Aboriginal kids being put in the out-of-home-care system and the lack of effort being put into reunification. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thoroughly support SNAICC's recommendation that we need a new approach. They talk about that in their program Family Matters—a program I highly recommend and strongly support. It's a shame the government is not paying more attention to SNAICC's recommendations, in terms of Family Matters, where they talk about the need for better strategies to reduce Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander poverty and homelessness, dealing with some of the underlying causes. Very importantly, it is about making sure there are Aboriginal peak organisations that are making the decisions—that are community controlled organisations making the decisions. That is absolutely critical. You would think, 20 years down the track from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bringing them home</span> report, that we would know that and that we would not have to be begging for that to occur. You would think it would be common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue the government agrees with, which I was pleased to see but I have a note of caution about, is supporting the recommendation around the National Disability Insurance Agency making funding available for children with disability, because there are a large number of children with a disability going into out-of-home care. They are relying, unfortunately, on the Early Childhood Early Intervention approach. The NDIS joint standing committee is currently looking at that. There are some very significant issues there. They shouldn't just be relying on NDIA picking up these issues, because there are very serious issues here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to be doing more about out-of-home care. They particularly need to be taking the lead in terms of the appalling number of Aboriginal children who are still going into out-of-home care. I urge the government to relook at this matter, to put effort into addressing this issue, or we will keep having the same issues. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Immigration and Border Protection, including its operational enforcement arm, the Australian Border Force, supports a broad range of activities that are vital for the prosperity and security of our nation. Facilitation of international trade, the supply of skilled labour for our domestic economy, business relationships, revenue collection, law enforcement and national security outcomes, travel and tourism and community protection are all important elements in building a strong and cohesive society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To carry out these functions, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection obtains information from individuals, industry, other sectors of government and foreign partners. Some of this information is highly sensitive and must be carefully managed. The Department must ensure that it is only used and disclosed for legitimate purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017</span> clarifies the secrecy and disclosure provisions in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Border Force Act 2015</span> (the ABF Act) to reflect the policy intent of those provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Part 6 of the ABF Act establishes these important secrecy and disclosure provisions, similar to provisions that were in place within the former Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and a range of other Commonwealth agencies. These protections prohibited the unauthorised making of a record or disclosure of information. Breach of these requirements is punishable by imprisonment for two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will clarify Part 6 and related provisions to reflect the original intent of the legislation, which is to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mishandling of information can cause significant damage to our national security, public safety, law enforcement capability or our economy. Individuals can also suffer serious detriment where personal and sensitive information is inappropriately disclosed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The secrecy and disclosure provisions in Part 6 of the ABF Act were adapted from the model in place for the former Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. However, this model has not kept pace with the developments in the modern border environment. This environment is complex and dynamic, and updated legislative settings are required to facilitate the evolving work of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The aim of the measures in this bill, therefore, is to ensure that Immigration and Border Protection information is provided with the necessary level of protection, in a targeted manner, but is also able to be disclosed when it is appropriate to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As not all information obtained by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection requires protection, the definition of the information to be protected has been refined to include only certain kinds of information, such as that relating to: the security, defence and international relations of Australia; prevention, detection and investigation of offences; protection of public health and safety; or sensitive personal and commercial matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There must be a balance between the competing interests of transparent, open and accountable government with the necessity of protecting certain information from disclosure which would lead to identifiable harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The prohibition in the ABF Act on disclosure of certain kinds of information is balanced by the exceptions to this prohibition that allow for authorised disclosures. This is why the bill includes measures to remove unnecessary and cumbersome administrative overlays. Streamlining the operation of the secrecy and disclosure provisions will allow more efficient sharing of information for legitimate purposes without removing important oversight and accountability measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill provides assurances for the Australian public, business, government and foreign partners that sensitive information provided to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will be appropriately protected, without unnecessarily restricting informed public debate. The retrospective application of the bill (back to the date the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Border Force Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>was enacted) will provide the necessary certainty that only information which could harm the national or public interest if disclosed is to be protected, and will be regarded as ever having been protected, under the ABF Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will reassure individuals who may otherwise believe they have committed an offence, in circumstances which would not have amounted to an offence under these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In conclusion, this bill will clarify the intent and refine the operation of the secrecy and disclosure provisions that govern the management of information in the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio. It illustrates the fine balance that must be struck in protecting sensitive information while upholding a commitment to open and accountable government. This bill underscores that commitment and will enable the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to more effectively manage information in service of our nation.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With this Bill, the Government is embarking on a comprehensive reform of Australia's working-age welfare payments; making the system simpler, more sustainable, and focussed on supporting people from welfare into employment. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill introduces a new, single JobSeeker Payment, which will replace or consolidate seven existing payments in order to simplify the working age payment system. It will also strengthen welfare conditionality for jobseekers with drug and alcohol abuse issues and better encourage and support them to pursue treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also sees a streamlining of administrative processes and the introduction of a new targeted compliance framework which will better identify and support vulnerable people and ensure that wilfully noncompliant jobseekers face appropriate penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill demonstrates that the Government is completely committed to improving the integrity of the welfare system and ensuring that recipients receive the necessary support and incentives to address barriers to employment, to look for work and to take a suitable job when it is available. This will benefit not just the jobseekers themselves but also their families, the wider community and the Australian economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 20 March 2020, this bill will introduce a new, single JobSeeker Payment, which will replace seven existing payments as the main payment for people of working age.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These multiple working age payments are a product of many years of ad hoc changes and dated policy decisions, which have created a system that is difficult to understand, navigate and administer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Creating a new JobSeeker Payment will ensure a single set of rules and rates for people of working age with the capacity to work. It will also firmly entrench long-term employment as the desired outcome for working age Australians who receive income support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under these changes, approximately 800,000 existing Newstart Allowance recipients are expected to transfer to the new JobSeeker Payment in 2020. A further 20,000 recipients of other working age income support payments are expected to progressively transition to the JobSeeker Payment, or other payments such as the Age Pension and Carer Payment where eligible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The eligibility rules and payment rates for the JobSeeker Payment will be based primarily on the existing rules and rates for Newstart Allowance. Eligibility will be broadened to include access for people who are temporarily sick or injured and unable to return to their work or study, rather than having to shift onto a different payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Bereavement provisions will also apply within the new JobSeeker Payment for people who would have otherwise claimed a Bereavement Allowance. Bereaved JobSeeker Payment recipients and claimants will receive a triple upfront payment, acknowledging the high upfront costs associated with losing a partner or spouse. Recipients will also receive temporary exemptions from mutual obligations requirements during their time of grief. Bereaved people will also be exempt from a number of conditions that would normally apply to jobseekers; ensuring that they get access to the payment when they need it the most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Transitional arrangements will be put in place for Wife Pension recipients who move to the JobSeeker Payment to ensure that their nominal rate of payment is not reduced as result of these changes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Replacing seven existing payments with one working age payment is a critical step in reforming our welfare system and will firmly entrench long-term employment as the desired outcome for Australians who enter the welfare system in a moment of need. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 2017-18 Budget included changes to mutual obligations requirements for jobseekers in other age groups. This includes aligning Activity Requirements for jobseekers aged between 30 and 49 years of age with those for jobseekers aged under 30 and introducing Annual Activity Requirements for jobseekers aged between 60 and the Age Pension age.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The community has a right to expect that taxpayer-funded welfare payments are not being used to fund drug and alcohol addiction and that jobseekers do all that they can reasonably do to find a job, including addressing any barriers which have prevented them from doing so.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While there are some existing mechanisms in place for identifying jobseekers with substance abuse issues and assisting them to seek treatment, the data clearly shows that much more needs to be done to help these individuals. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, the measures in this bill are complemented by other measures that do not require legislation. This includes, for the first time, ensuring that all jobseekers are able to undertake drug or alcohol treatment as an approved activity in their Job Plan. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While drug testing is currently used in Australia by many employers and, of course, by police and law enforcement, and it has also been used overseas in relation to welfare recipients, there is little comparable evidence available to tell us whether this sort of intervention would be effective in the Australian welfare context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why this measure has been specifically designed as a trial – to build that evidence base and assess the value of drug testing as a way of identifying those for whom drug misuse is a barrier to work, and as a means of supporting them to undertake treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The trial will operate in three locations. The selection of these locations will be based on evidence and data about drug use in Australia to ensure the trial is targeted at supporting regions with a high incidence of drug use. The availability of treatment services and the ability to apply a welfare quarantining mechanism will also be key factors in determining trial locations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this trial, from 1 January 2018, people claiming Newstart Allowance or Youth Allowance (other) in the trial locations will be required to acknowledge that they may be subject to drug testing as part of the claim process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Drug testing will coincide with Department of Human Service' appointments and will be administered by a contracted third party drug testing provider. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be comprehensive rules set out in a legislative instrument relating to the trial locations, the illicit drugs tested for and the protocols for conducting the drug tests, including safeguards to ensure that testing is conducted appropriately and in accordance with relevant standards. This legislative instrument will provide the flexibility to ensure that the expert advice of the contracted testing provider and the drug and alcohol sector can be taken into account in developing these protocols and safeguards.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jobseekers who test positive to a drug test will have their payments placed on Income Management for 24 months. This is designed to restrict their access to cash and, therefore, limit their ability to use payments to fund further harmful drug use. Jobseekers who test positive will also be subject to a second drug test within 25 working days and may also be subject to further subsequent tests. This will help to identify those for whom drug misuse is an ongoing problem which may require treatment and which is creating a barrier to employment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jobseekers who test positive to more than one drug test during the trial will be referred to a Department of Human Services contracted medical professional with experience in drug and alcohol treatment who will assess their particular circumstances and identify appropriate treatment or support options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the report from the medical professional recommends treatment, the jobseeker will be required to participate in one or more treatment activities to address their substance abuse as part of their Job Plan. This could include, for example, activities such as rehabilitation, counselling or case management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This trial is not about penalising jobseekers with drug abuse issues. It is about finding new and better ways of identifying these jobseekers and ensuring they are referred to the support and treatment they need.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will also make changes to mutual obligation exemptions to better support and encourage jobseekers with substance misuse issues to remain actively engaged and pursue treatment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, jobseekers can be granted an exemption on the basis of temporary incapacity due to drug or alcohol dependency. Exemptions can also be granted in other circumstances that may be related to drug or alcohol abuse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This allows jobseekers to be exempt from all mutual obligation requirements with no expectation that they will undertake appropriate activities to address the underlying problem – their substance abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is why, from 1 January 2018, jobseekers will no longer be able to be exempt from their mutual obligation or participation requirements if the circumstances affecting their ability to meet their requirements is primarily due to drug or alcohol dependency or misuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure reflects that jobseekers who do have substance dependency or misuse issues that prevent them from looking for work should be taking active steps to address their issues rather than being exempt from all requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is estimated that around 11,000 exemptions per year will no longer be granted under this measure, noting that some jobseekers may currently get more than one exemption in a year related to their substance misuse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jobseekers who are no longer eligible for an exemption will instead remain connected to their employment service provider and actively engaged in appropriate activities tailored to their particular circumstances and barriers to work, including their substance misuse issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is investing $28.8 million to ensure that jobseekers receive this tailored support from their provider during the period they would previously have been exempt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will also tighten the reasonable excuse rules to provide an incentive for jobseekers, who are having difficulty meeting their requirements due to drug or alcohol dependency, to undertake treatment as part of their mutual obligation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jobseekers on income support negotiate a Job Plan with their employment service provider. It is based on their individual circumstances and capacity and is designed to help the jobseeker move towards supporting themselves through paid work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If jobseekers do not undertake the mutual obligations that are agreed to in their Job Plan, they can face financial penalties. To avoid unfairly penalising recipients, a penalty cannot legally be applied if the jobseeker has a reasonable excuse for failing to meet their requirements – that is if jobseekers miss an appointment or cannot attend an activity for reasons beyond their control. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently though, there are rules which allow jobseekers to repeatedly use drug or alcohol dependency as a reasonable excuse without making any effort to address their circumstances. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 January 2018, the Government will amend the reasonable excuse criteria so that jobseekers will not be able to repeatedly use drug or alcohol dependency as a reasonable excuse unless they are seeking treatment, if it is available and appropriate. This measure targets those who are unable to meet their mutual obligation requirements due to drug or alcohol related reasons, and will encourage those recipients into available treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following a first instance of noncompliance due to drug or alcohol dependency, jobseekers will face no penalty but will be given the option of voluntarily undertaking treatment for their dependency (if that treatment is appropriate and available) or continuing with their normal mutual obligation requirements as managed by their employment services provider. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For jobseekers who choose treatment, participating in this treatment will reduce, or in some circumstances fully meet, their mutual obligation requirements.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a jobseeker refuses to participate in available and appropriate treatment, they will no longer be able to continue to use their drug and alcohol conditions as a reasonable excuse for future noncompliance. If they again fail to meet their requirements due to drug or alcohol use, they may then face a financial penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure will provide stronger incentives and better support for jobseekers to pursue the treatment they need to overcome their substance dependency and move towards supporting themselves through paid work.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, these measures recognise that supporting jobseekers to address their substance abuse issues through appropriate treatment is a critical first step on the path to employment.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will create a simpler, fairer, more targeted and certainly more effective jobseeker compliance framework to ensure that all jobseekers are meeting their mutual obligation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that almost two thirds of jobseekers attend all appointments or miss only one at most in any six month period, and that payment suspension is sufficient to ensure re-engagement in the majority of cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the other extreme, there is a small core of jobseekers who appear to be gaming the system by only attending appointments which reactivate suspended income support payments. Those jobseekers have no underlying reason for their persistent noncompliance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current framework does not differentiate between these groups of jobseekers and, critically, it does not always provide the support necessary to those who need help to meet their requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new targeted framework is designed to change the behaviour of non-genuine jobseekers, while supporting the majority of jobseekers who are absolutely genuine in their efforts to find work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jobseekers who wilfully and repeatedly fail to comply with their agreed job plan requirements, with no underlying cause, will face real penalties, with graduated loss of income support payments culminating in payment cancellation and a four week non-payment period for the most recalcitrant jobseekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the new framework, all jobseekers will commence in a demerits phase. Every time a jobseeker misses a requirement, their payment will be suspended then back paid when they re-engage. They will also accrue a demerit if they do not have a valid reason for their failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If a jobseeker accrues four demerits within six months they will enter the three strikes phase, where they will face stronger penalties, beginning with the loss of half their fortnightly payment the first time they miss a requirement without a reasonable excuse. They will lose all of their fortnightly payment the second time they do not meet a requirement and after a third failure they will face payment cancellation for four weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that genuine jobseekers who are simply having difficulty meeting their requirements do not enter the three strikes phase, their provider will assess their capability and requirements after their third demerit and the Department of Human Services will also do so after their fourth. At either point, if a jobseeker is found to be unable to meet their requirements because of some underlying capability issue, those requirements will be adjusted, their demerits reset, and they will remain in the demerits phase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Once a jobseeker is in the three strikes phase, they can still avoid any penalties by simply meeting all their requirements. Those who remain fully compliant for three months will return to the demerits phase and have their demerits reset to zero. This will provide a strong incentive for jobseekers to change their behaviour and start to comply with their requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jobseekers in either phase who refuse an offer of suitable work or fail to start in a suitable job without a reasonable excuse will have their payment cancelled and will then face a four week non-payment period before they can receive payment. This penalty is identical to that imposed on jobseekers who have reached three strikes. It recognises the seriousness of refusing work and the importance of reducing reliance on welfare wherever reasonably possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Jobseekers who voluntarily leave a suitable job or are dismissed due to misconduct will also face a four week non-payment period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Waivers will no longer be available for refusing or failing to accept an offer of suitable employment, so that jobseekers who have proven time and again that they are unwilling to meet their requirements or accept work will actually serve a penalty. However the penalty for these failures is reduced from eight weeks to four weeks to reflect the detrimental impact that long periods without payment can have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new compliance framework will be considerably simpler than the current system. This will make it easier for jobseekers to understand the consequences of noncompliance, and will reduce unnecessary red-tape and administration for providers. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No penalty will be applied to any jobseeker if they have a reasonable excuse for any failure to observe a mutual obligation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  The media landscape is changing fast. The industry is changing and the industry's regulation needs changing too. It's ridiculous to say that the only way to defend a struggling industry is to defend the regulation that's preventing it from defending itself against new and enormous threats. But concerns around the potential loss of media diversity as a result of the changes posed are real and valid. It is important that any deal to change regulation also protects media diversity in the process. Nobody wants any one media baron to have excessive power over the political landscape, and the best way to address concerns about private media ownership is to invest in publicly owned media. The government, with courage, would put whatever it's proposing to a vote. That's not what it has agreed to. Instead, reports suggest that the government has made some sneaky handshake deal in a back room somewhere to undermine the operations of the ABC, and it has gone behind the back of the Senate to do it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  I did have a prepared speech but I want to address that contribution from Senator Lambie. The media reform as presented in this suite of initiatives by the government on a very vexed and difficult issue, which befuddled the opposition when it was in power—I remember under Senator Conroy trying to find some way to ensure the sustainability and diversity of our media in the face of incredible disruption—does not mean a pitchfork to the ABC and does not mean media barons. I'd much rather an Australian own a media company in this country than a foreign company own a media company in this country, which is exactly what can occur, Senator Lambie, under current arrangements. I'm happy to walk you through it if you'd like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have in front of us for this debate is a bill with a comprehensive suite of measures to bring the Australian media landscape out of the 1980s, the era of Michael J Fox, <span style="font-style:italic;">Back to the Future</span>, Duran Duran—you might remember it, Senator Seselja and Senator Smith—before mobile phone companies outbid broadcasters to stream the Ashes or other cricket games, netball games, as we've got at the moment, or indeed AFL. That has always been the purview of our TV broadcasters, but they're being outbid for those sorts of rights and initiatives, and increasingly Australians are using their mobile phones in new and innovative ways that mean that the old regulation, the old way we regulated and the framework in which our media environment exists, is no longer tenable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was part of the joint committee in 2013 that made very similar recommendations, and I remember that the National Party then refused to support certain changes to aspects of our media laws because we too were concerned about local content in regional areas. We were worried about large media companies swamping our smaller newspapers, radio broadcasters and TV broadcasters. But five years down the track the reality is that I would rather have some Australian media outlets in regional areas than none, and that is what we're staring down the barrel of if we don't give them a fighting chance to deliver the type of diversity that we need and that technology can deliver us over time even.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was before we had Netflix, Stan, Facebook or Google. The media environment in this country has been severely disrupted, and we've seen a very direct result and impact of that disruption as journalists face job losses, as Australians turn away from broadsheets to Facebook for their news and as regional broadcasters struggle in the face of decreasing advertising revenue and decreasing eyeballs. We must do something to ensure that regional media diversity is sustainable going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality for regional Australians, though, in the way we access information is different, culturally and technologically. We don't necessarily have access to the same communications infrastructure. It's not as easy for many regional Australians to interact with Netflix—yet; it will be, but right now it's not. So we needed to ensure in this package that regional media diversity and local content was secured, and I believe that we have a mechanism within this media reform package to ensure that. We have incentivised those companies who have boots on the ground in our communities, who have cameramen at our sporting events, who have journalists living and working amongst us, telling our stories, working with us to promote community events and sharing in the reporting of emergency broadcasts during bushfires, floods, cyclones and drought. This is the reality. Reporting on somebody's lived experience is very different than having it as part of your own. So, ensuring that this package incentivises media companies to keep that physical commitment to regional Australia—to have the journalists, the cameramen and the cadets locally to train up—is something that I am very pleased is part of this reform initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the two Senate inquiries that went to the heart of this bill there were issues around whether the reach rule would be repealed. Some of the concerns raised were that online streaming services—straight into peoples' homes, not those that require a broadcasting licence—don't have to include any local regional news, don't need to include any local regional advertising, don't include any local community service announcements and are not subject to the commercial television industry code of practice. So it's very rich for senators to come into this place and try and tell senators that live and work and represent regional communities that keeping the current system in place is better than dealing with the fact that right now regional capitals that have the technology infrastructure, like Bendigo, Sale or Pakenham, those live streaming suites and broadcasters, if you like—I mean, it's a very poor definition of what a broadcaster is, but that's a whole other issue which I think I raised in my additional comments to the Senate report—but don't actually have those sorts of requirements on them that we do put on our TV broadcasters right now. Our TV broadcasters, our WINs, our Prime 7s, are often competing against the mother ship, the mother company of 9, 7 or 10, streaming right into the living rooms with the evening news, without those requirements about backing regional small business and backing regional news. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the video-on-demand services and online streaming of metropolitan broadcasts, Prime, in its evidence to the committee, added that the regional television industry is facing several other significant structural challenges, including: a reduction in the size of regional advertising market; encountering a loss of $65 million over the last three years; a decline in actual audience numbers year on year, with the aggregated markets of Queensland, northern and southern NSW and Victoria losing 6.9 per cent of total audience; affiliation fees payable by regional broadcasters to metropolitan networks, which increase every year. You can't get <span style="font-style:italic;">MasterChef</span>, you can't get <span style="font-style:italic;">Survivor</span> unless you do the deal with the metropolitan affiliate. The fact that those affiliation fees go up and up year on year, despite declining revenue and declining eyeballs, is a significant issue for our regional broadcaster. That is why Mitch Fifield, as minister, has been able to perform the miraculous event at which all media outlets have come together as one to say, 'We need this change. We need this change to be sustainable to compete in the current media environment.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to briefly make comments around the importance of meaningful local content for people living in regional areas. That was emphasised to the committee by the President of the NSW Farmers' Association, Mr Schoen:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is vitally important to maintain local content in delivery of media services to country areas. It is a little bit like if I went to go to Sydney I would find the news there very alien to me. And if you came to Corowa, I am sure you would find the media that we dish out fairly alien to you. It is vitally important that the content is applicable to the audience that is going to receive it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't back those comments more. That is why I was disappointed by Senator Lambie's comments around the ABC. I am a huge backer of the ABC, particularly local radio, which plays such a vital role in my regional communities—community service announcements; emergency service broadcasts; making sure we have local news and weather; local entertainment. In particular, some of our presenters can be very humorous and keep us laughing. It's the first dial most regional Australians go to. To see, over time, the ABC denuded of its regional voice and staffing, under Mark Scott in particular—I do note the current managing director and board's commitment, through the minister's focus, to actually increasing the level of staffing in regional areas. That is a great thing. It goes to the heart of ensuring local content is available for regional communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the three-point system. Currently those senators that are opposing these changes are very happy for regional communities to have someone in Canberra read out Senator Urquhart's media releases, Senator Hanson-Young's media releases, Senator Smith's media releases—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241710" type="MemberInterjecting">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Smith:</span>
                    </a>  I don't do media releases!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKENZIE:</span>
                    </a>  I shouldn't have taken that interjection, but unfortunately I did! But to read out members and senators' media releases and to say that that actually counts as local content—that is appalling. What this bill has done is incentivise those that have employed locally and have maintained that local journalistic commitment to the community. They will receive a points incentive. The regional broadcasters argued that the proposed inclusion of the three-point category for local content would not lead to a reduction in local content, as some others argued, but was indeed something that they very much supported. Prime Media Group said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…we have committed to a local news bulletin in Western Australia, where we had no licence requirement to do it, says that we are not looking to cut back the amount of local content. We would much prefer to produce more local content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, Mr Lancaster from WIN said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From a practical perspective, if you as a broadcaster are going to go to the trouble of putting a cameraperson or a journalist … into a market to capture that footage to be locally relevant, why would you give it a reduced amount of time? It is good content. If you are going to invest in the capturing of that content to get that video content, you would not reduce the amount of minutes …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't make practical sense to those people involved in producing local content that the points system, as envisaged by the legislation, would result in a reduction of local content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to touch on the negotiations that seem to have been going on around this particular piece of legislation. I note Senator Hanson is in the chamber, and I recognise her support for the ABC rural and regional advocacy bill changes. In exchange for her support for the ABC media reforms, Senator Hanson and One Nation have seen the value in having a change to the ABC's charter, for it to reflect what community thinks it should do. That is: it should have a specific obligation to reflect the geographic diversity of our nation. She sees the value in having two people from rural and regional Australia with embedded experience on the board of the ABC. She sees the value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Xenophon and I worked on his short wave bill, and we went up with Senator McCarthy and Senator Urquhart to Darwin to talk to the Northern Territory community about the ABC's decision to cut broadcasting through short-wave technology to those communities of the Pacific and northern Australia. It was simply because the board did not consult with the communities affected, and the amount of information given to the board to make that decision was appalling. I would recommend the committee's report into that. Senator Xenophon is very concerned about that particular issue, and he knows the importance of the ABC consulting and having an advisory committee from rural and regional Australia on which to test their ideas around service delivery and the type of technology being used to service regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there are just some simple changes to the annual reporting of the ABC around staff and where they are located, to ensure that the ABC is delivering for regional communities. I would encourage and thank Senator Hanson for her support, particularly for those measures in my private senator's bill; I appreciate that very much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The regional Australia media market is about our people telling our stories to our community—to live amongst us. And this suite of measures, aside from the gambling advertisement issues, sits around the review of children's content and removing and making sure the ownership laws of our media market actually reflect the reality of the 21st century. They give our media owners the flexibility to be nimble and innovative. It is an incredibly tough, disrupted environment out there right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a liberal democracy like ours, you need a multitude of voices for the citizens to consider. Look at the public spend of local governments—and this is one of the issues raised in my private senator's bill, but it is instructive for this particular debate. When you look at the amount of public money being administered by local councils, often the only overseers, the only ones actually examining that spend and the decisions of local governments across this country, are newspapers like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Benalla Ensign</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Riverine Herald</span> up in Echuca and what they look at with the Campaspe Shire, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bendigo Weekly</span>, looking at how the Bendigo council administers its funds. It's very important—fundamental to the secure functioning of our democracy indeed—that we have a robust, diverse, sustainable local media. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think our reforms are very thoughtful. The minister has widely consulted to ensure that the reform package being delivered here to the Senate tonight, and hopefully to be supported by the Senate this week, will deliver on the promise for Australia. We don't want to be a nation where American TV companies own our regional broadcasters and own our big broadcasters, where we have a diminishing amount of broadsheets available and everything moves online. It is rural and regional communities, and indeed the broader community, who will suffer. I have gone to the heart of ensuring that local production and local content is important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales Farmers' Association, in their submission on the bill, wanted to look at concerns around the footprint, expanding what definitions around 'local' entail. I know that ACMA will be looking at that. The New South Wales Farmers' Association wanted to request that ACMA be diligent in ensuring effective compliance activities in policing local content. They also recommended that consumer protections in voice and data and telecommunications be upgraded to ensure that regional people have equal access to both voice and data, because, as the media environment changes, it will be more and more important that all Australians are able to access a variety of media voices using a variety of technologies. Right now, in regional Australia, we are going ahead in leaps and bounds. The over 750 mobile phone towers that the coalition government has delivered to regional Australia are going a long way towards that. But the Productivity Commission's USO paper and indeed the government's deliberations around the universal service obligation will go quite deeply to how regional Australians will be able to access news content and information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I did have a lot more to say around how ACMA can work with regional Australians' online footprint and ensure local content, but I know there are many other senators who need to speak on this. I commend all those who submitted to the Senate inquiries into this issue over a long period of time. I commend the minister for having a suite of arrangements which try and strike a balance between ensuring our media environment is forward looking, where our media owners are able to be nimble and innovative enough in this 21st century to deliver the content that we need to function, but also ensuring that they are financially sustainable going forward and that we have some rigour around the journalists who keep us all honest every single day of our lives in this job—and you wouldn't want it any other way. I would just like to see it across all levels of government. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I rise to speak to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017. The premise underlying broadcasting ownership laws—that government can decide who can and who can't own sections of the media—is little more than nanny state nonsense. It reminds me of countries that don't believe in free speech and where there is no right to hear points of view that are not approved. On top of that is aunty state nonsense, in which the government owns and operates multiple TV, radio and online media behemoths itself. These cost taxpayers a lot of money and compete with the commercial sector, making it less viable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reduces restrictions on commercial broadcasting ownership so that the nanny state is a little less intrusive and, hopefully, the commercial sector is better able to withstand the marauding aunty. Probably more significantly, the changes mean that some of the artificial restraints on traditional Australian media that have left them at a competitive disadvantage compared with international internet based businesses such as Google and Facebook will be removed. Global internet based media are expected to attract $4 billion to $5 billion worth of advertising revenue next year. This represents 35 to 40 per cent of the Australian advertising market, and this is only expected to rise, eroding ad revenue available to traditional media faster than any overall advertising growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill abolishes the two-out-of-three rule. This rule prevents someone from controlling a television station, radio station and non-national newspaper in the same region. Abolishing the rule would allow someone to control all three platforms in the region. This change is supported by most of the media and was specifically requested by the Ten Network in the face of major losses, because declining market share due to online competition has placed them under strain. We now see Ten will be taken over by the US company CBS, because local businesses are unable to do so because of the current legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have no concerns about foreign investment in our media sector, I wonder whether those who have held up this legislation, in particular, Senators Xenophon and Hanson, believe they have done the right thing. Yes, some of the smaller and less efficient media organisations will be swallowed up by larger and more efficient companies, but that is how markets are supposed to work. Takeovers and bankruptcies are the means of selection in the commercial world. Survival depends on offering the cheapest, best value or greatest range to the benefit of consumers. Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Christianity without hell. Why be good if there is no consequence from doing otherwise?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some oppose the reduction in ownership restrictions based on a view that wicked media barons might somehow take over our news and turn us into brain-washed zombies. This reflects a dated view of news and information. Tradition free-to-air television, radio and print media no longer control our access to news and entertainment because more and more of us are getting this from a wide range of sources on the internet. Media barons already own commercial broadcasting in Australia, so if media barons are a threat to our democracy, that threat exists as much under the current law as under this bill. Whenever people raise fears about media barons determining the news and controlling our minds, they fail to mention the continuing presence of the ABC and SBS. Zombies, indeed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also amend the reach rule by removing the ban on owning licences that cover more than 75 per cent of Australia's population. The 75 per cent reach rule is generally regarded as redundant by the industry, given the availability of online content, which transcends geographic boundaries. These reforms are aimed at allowing Australian television, radio and newspaper companies to operate across more media platforms. However, the bill also inserts a requirement on anyone with more than 75 per cent coverage to air more regional and local content than they are currently required to do. Arguments that the relaxation of ownership laws will hurt Australians in our regions and that regional and local content rules are required to protect precious local content are a complete furphy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple question is: which would you rather watch? A media conference by the Prime Minister or self-promotion by the local, political blowhard? The State of Origin match or amateur hour at West Wyalong school hall? A gripping US drama or an interminable fishing show about the local waterhole, where hardly anyone ever catches any fish? India versus Australia in the cricket or an interview with a crazy cat lady who lives in a dump bin at the edge of town? The latest movie blockbuster or a drawn-out tourist promo on the world's second largest ball of string? Just because you live in a regional area doesn't mean you are only interested in trivial local issues and want to be left in a low-budget, fly-blown, regional time warp. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, the increased content rules in this bill are a mere blemish in an otherwise laudable bill. Not only does the bill reduce ownership restrictions, but it also changes the so-called antisiphoning rules that prevent pay television from bidding for certain sporting events, unless the event is also to be broadcast on free-to-air or the event starts within the next three months. The bill will allow pay television bids, where the event starts in the next six months, and delists all golf, some rugby league, soccer, rugby union, cricket, tennis, netball and motor sport. The effect of the antisiphoning rules is to reduce access to sports by pay TV. This depresses the prices paid for broadcasting rights, which, in turn, hurts sportsmen and women from the affected sports. It also hurts the sports fans who prefer pay TV, which can often offer a better, less interrupted viewing experience. If pay TV were able to bid for more sports, the pay TV market in Australia could expand, facilitating further improvements in the quality of viewing on offer. Expanding the pay TV market could even support the competition for Foxtel in subscription-based sports broadcasting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, in the Liberal Democrats, would like to go further than this bill; we would like to see an end to all restrictions on commercial media ownership, the abolition of local content rules, the abolition of restrictions on what pay TV can bid for and the privatisation of the ABC and SBS dinosaurs to boot. This is because the bottom line is that it is not the business of government to say who owns what and who broadcasts what. Both nannies and aunties are private matters, not matters for the government. However, insofar as this bill is a step in the right direction, I will be supporting it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0V" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WILLIAMS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017, especially in relation to regional media. My chief of staff, Greg Kachel, is pretty well known around this building and he has been here with me for nine years, since I started my job on 1 July 2008—that's going back a while now, Senator Smith. I have the same four staff I started with—it means either jobs are scarce or I am a good boss; probably the former, I would think. I couldn't believe it when I moved from South Australia in 1979 to Inverell to find that, wow, they had their own local radio station. Greg had 32 years there—14 years working on the radio and 18 years as its manager. There were about 17 people employed at 2NZ and later on they brought in GEM FM. I think today they probably have five or six employed there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a great and essential service this radio station gives. For example, on 7 February 1991 we had a severe flood in Inverell. The staff were outside on the roof of the local radio station; they set up the transmitter out on the Glen Innes road and they broadcast for four days, relaying messages from the police and informing the community of what was going on with the clean-up et cetera. This is an essential service. This radio station has trained so many people. For example, Ashley Brown from Channel Seven started at 2NZ; Janine Toohey is at 2GB; Kelly Fuller is at ABC Tamworth. Kelly has just had time off on maternity leave, and I wish Kelly all the best when she returns to work. I'm glad she and her husband have the pleasure of a young baby boy. Luke Grant at 2GB spent many years working at 2NZ Inverell. He's a very humorous man; I've enjoyed his company very much. The local radio station is there to serve. I've mentioned my chief of staff, Greg Kachel. He was named best sports presenter in country radio one year and he also won the award for the best news event coverage for the 1991 Inverell flood. For years, 2NZ has had the best sports coverage, including the Grafton to Inverell Cycle Classic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the humour of the local radio station. Years ago, there was a breakfast announcer named Terry Harkins. Come April Fools' Day, the jokes would often come out of the local radio station. One morning—1 April it was—Terry Harkins had a recording playing and the window was open. He said a livestock truck with a load of sheep had tipped over at the end of the town and the street was full of sheep. He was playing, 'Baa, baa,' and out of the window, through his microphone, he was calling for the local farmers: 'Jack, could you bring your sheep dog? We've got to round up these sheep up.' Of course, when Jack rolled in with his dog and his four-wheel drive Hilux, or whatever it was, there was no truck turned over; it was just an April Fools' Day joke. That was one of the many things that happened at the local radio station. There was the year that Pete Diskin was hosting breakfast on April Fools' Day. He said, 'Our chief-of-staff, Greg Kachel, the boss, has gone out to Copeton Dam to go camping and he's got the key to the music room,' so he didn't have any music; he kept playing the one track. He asked, 'Will you bring some music down?' and people were rolling up to the station with their CDs of music, saying, 'Here. Give these a run and play these.' Of course, it was simply an April Fools' Day joke, but people had a laugh out of it. This was the local entertainment by the local station. Greg was telling me that many years ago, when he started—about 41 years ago—there were about 17 people employed. Now there'd be five or six.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I make is that, for many in the media, businesses are doing it tough. I know that for a fact. For example, my wife, Nancy, worked for 10 years at <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bingara Advocate</span> newspaper. For the last 20 years or so, she's owned that paper and a couple of years ago bought <span style="font-style:italic;">The Warialda Standard</span> as well when that came on the market, because there was a risk that the <span style="font-style:italic;">The Warialda Standard</span> would close down. If you lose your local paper in your local community, your country town, to a certain extent you lose the heart of your town—the communication—especially the towns with many elderly people who want to know where the meetings are and where the best bargains are at the IGA, et cetera. Nancy's worked hard in her business. I'm very proud of the work she's done. She doesn't make a lot of money, although in the 2015 financial year she made more than $1 billion. Yes, $1 billion more than Fairfax. Nancy made a profit and Fairfax lost a billion dollars. She still didn't make much money, but it was $1 billion more than Fairfax, which is a pretty good story, don’t you think?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All the media—newspapers, radio and, of course, television—are so essential to regional communities. Prime Television in Tamworth has the local news at 6 o'clock every night. Anyone who works in country television will tell you there is an enormous cost to putting local news together. The cameramen and the journalists travel around the community for hundreds of kilometres a day to various towns to do stories and put them together. This legislation makes it easier for television stations like Prime, NBN and WIN to survive financially. I'm quite amazed that those opposite are not supporting this legislation. When you've got Channels Seven, Nine and Ten, Foxtel, Sky, Southern Cross, Prime, NBN and WIN—all the media mobs—supporting it, I can't understand why it's being opposed by the Labor Party and others in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend my good friend and colleague Senator Bridget McKenzie, who has done so much work on the issue of communications, especially in regional Australia. And I commend Minister Fifield for the great work he's done working with people throughout the coalition to come to a great result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation removes the reach rule of 75 per cent so that broadcasters can go further than 75 per cent of their audience. It also does away with the two-out-of-three ownership, which means that, if you own a television station and a newspaper in an area, you can't own a radio station as well. It allows people to expand. The reason they're doing that is to allow businesses to survive. I remember when I was a very young fellow in the sixties, we were fortunate to have television in South Australia. We had two television stations, GTS4 at Port Pirie and the ABC from Adelaide. If you turn on free-to-air now, there are many stations: ABC, ABC 1, ABC News 24, 7Mate, Seven, Ten, Nine—you name it. There's probably a selection of 10 to 15 free-to-air stations. Of course, that means that competition for a certain limited market is very tough. Of course, media is one of those industries where the costs continue to go up and up and up—whether it's the cost of employing the people or the cost of the licences. You have such a limited, restricting audience; people just don't flow in the door all the time; and there's only so much advertising that can be carried out. So here is the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key elements of this package are repealing the 75 per cent audience reach rule. The abolition of the broadcasting licensing fees for television and radio, currently totalling about $130 million a year, will allow broadcasters to better compete with other media platforms. I will give you an example. Prime television may buy programs from Channel 7 and show those programs in Tamworth, for example, through the New England area, but you can't go onto Prime and stream; you have to go to Channel 7. Then of course, Channel 7 in the city gets advertising for that very issue. This will free it up to allow streaming and will make it more competitive. There will be the introduction of a price for the use of spectrum by broadcasters that better reflects its use, a bit like a fuel tax—the more fuel you burn, the more tax you pay. That's fair enough because you're wearing out the roads more et cetera. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also protecting Australian children by banning gambling advertising during sports broadcasts in children's viewing hours. I think that's essential, and I'm sure Senator Xenophon would agree with that immensely. There are amendments to the antisiphoning scheme and list, which is simply there to create a level playing field for so many. I'm a big supporter of that level playing field, and I know it's one thing we don't have in the energy industry. It includes a broad-ranging and comprehensive review of Australian and children's content and a $30 million package for subscription television to support the broadcasting of women's and niche sports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Revenue for radio and television is flat or declining in real terms. As I said, it's a tough game, as online and on-demand services draw audiences away from the traditional broadcast content. This is the new world that we live in. It's not so much that you have to be within the TV reception area—that was basically a monopoly, as it was in the sixties. Where I grew up, in Port Pirie in the mid-north of South Australia, there was one commercial station, GTS4, and the ABC. As I said, the costs are rising and audiences have the greatest choice ever in what they want to watch. The competition is there, big time. We've seen through technology that you can go on your computer and download any movie or watch whatever you want. It is just open slather to view whatever you want to these days. There is so much competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional radio, as I mentioned—and I talked about radio 2NZ at Inverell—has faced rising challenges. That is why, unfortunately, you see an owner, who may hold several licences around rural and regional areas, elect to run network programs at parts of the day and at weekends to save costs. Let me expand on that: 2NZ at Inverell was owned by farmers out at Moree, along with 2VM, another great radio station at Moree. Along came the buyers, who bought them up, and now 2NZ is one of 50 or 60 radio stations linked with 2SM in Sydney and the satellite is there. The one I know most about is 2NZ, thanks to Greg Kachel. They used to commence at 5.30 in the morning and they would close at midnight. They wouldn't broadcast from midnight through to 5.30 in the morning. That was shut-down time. Of course, now it's a 24-hour station. They can do that because of satellite and networking keeping the costs down. If you wanted to do that in the old days, you would have had to simply employ more radio announcers to be able to keep the doors open and the station broadcasting longer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the advent of satellite, a city radio station can send its programs live to many stations in regional areas, and that's what happens. With technology, the announcer in a city station can activate a regional station's commercials and weather, and that's exactly how it happens. Someone sitting in a studio in 2SM in Sydney, when it comes to an advert break, simply presses a button and runs the local adverts at local stations, not the city adverts, and likewise with the local weather. Of course, this obviously saves costs because the owner is paying for one announcer's wages rather than having announcers sitting in studios at all of the regional stations. There's undoubtedly a cost element to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Broadcast licence fees for radio and television will be replaced by a spectrum price for television and radio that will be set at a total of around $40 million. The first spectrum payment will be made in 2017-18. Unlike broadcast licence fees, a spectrum fee is not based upon revenue; rather, the price takes account of the type of transmitter used, the amount and type of spectrum used, and its location. This is a similar approach to that which applies to other spectrum users. Overall, the vast majority of broadcasters will pay considerably less in spectrum fees than they currently pay in licence fees. This fee relief will enable broadcasters to better compete with online competitors, invest in their businesses and produce Australian content. In June, in relation to the interim relief of $20 million announced in the 2016-17 budget, Joan Warner, the chief executive officer of the industry body Commercial Radio Australia, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We welcome the removal of broadcast licence fees for the 2016-17 financial year. It will allow radio to invest more in Australian jobs and content. However, we continue to call on the parliament to support the total media reform package which provides much needed long-term relief for local Australian radio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this package is about: long-term relief for local Australian radio. The government hopes to deliver permanent financial relief with this reform package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the restriction of gambling advertising, the government has listened to the concerns that regular exposure to gambling advertisements during live sport normalises gambling in the eyes of children and encourages vulnerable persons to gamble, simply promoting it too much. In light of these concerns, the government has decided that existing rules are not meeting community expectations and that additional restrictions are required to provide appropriate community safeguards. It is about those safeguards for the community and not overdoing the advertising of gambling. The new restrictions will prohibit all gambling advertising and promotions from five minutes before the scheduled start of play of all live sporting events to five minutes after the conclusion of the play in the period between 5 am and 8.30 pm. The new restrictions are to be implemented, commencing from March 2018. Importantly, the restrictions will apply to commercial television, commercial radio, subscription television, the Special Broadcasting Service and online services showing live sport aimed at Australian audiences. The new restrictions will establish a clear and practical safe zone on any platform for children watching live sport, which will be straightforward for families to observe. The restrictions will apply to all broadcast gambling promotions, including advertising, in-program promotions of betting markets and odds, and sponsorship announcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will continue to work with industry to ensure the new restrictions are implemented effectively and in a timely manner. There are some existing restrictions in place that will reassure viewers who are worried that they will be saturated with gambling advertisements after this time. Appendix 3 of the Commercial Television Industry Code Of Practice already restricts when betting advertisements or the promotion of odds are permitted. For example, during a live sporting event, gambling advertisements may only be shown at designated times, such as before and after play and during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. The promotion of odds is not permitted during play, scheduled breaks or in unscheduled breaks during a live sport event. That is what this package is about: protecting the young from gambling—and not only the young but also the elderly, who may, unfortunately, have a gambling problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to amending the antisiphoning scheme and list, the government supports the principle that nationally significant sporting events should be available on free-to-air television—that is most important. We all want to watch the Sydney Swans take out the AFL grand final this year, or even, in two weeks time, when they beat the Adelaide Crows—wouldn't you agree, Senator O'Neill? Are there no South Australians here? Yes, Senator Hanson-Young is here. The government is taking action to modernise the antisiphoning scheme. This includes updating the list of events to remove a modest number of events that no long warrant inclusion on the list. Most of these events coming off the list are those which are no longer broadcast on free-to-air, garner small audiences or where the relationship to Australia is remote or non-existent—for example, the FA Cup final and the US Masters golf. Iconic events like the Olympics, the Commonwealth Games, all AFL and NRL Premiership matches, including finals, the Australian Open tennis and the Melbourne Cup will remain on the list—and so they should. These changes will enable greater competition between subscription broadcasters and free-to-air television, while retaining significant cultural or sporting events on the list to ensure they remain widely available for Australian audiences. Importantly, this does not mean that these events will necessarily end up on pay TV. There are currently events that are broadcast on free-to-air TV that are not and have never been on the antisiphoning list. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about funding for under-represented sports on pay TV. This is very important. The government is providing $7.5 million per annum in funding over four years to subscription television to increase coverage of sports that receive low or no broadcast exposure—women's sports, niche sports and sports that command high levels of community involvement and participation. Women's sports, in particular, remain substantially under-represented in terms of overall coverage and news reporting relative to male sports. In 2013, dedicated television coverage of women in sport made up only seven per cent of all sports coverage. This package includes a promotion of women's sport. It is fair. It is reasonable. It looks after our children. It looks after the gambling issue as far as advertising goes. Most importantly, it provides a mechanism for those many battling media organisations, whether that they be local radio, local newspapers or regional television, to financially survive. We cannot see those great Prime, NBN and WIN television networks go under. That would be a huge loss to our community. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  Over the past few months, since the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Bill 2017 was brought forward to be introduced into the parliament, One Nation has had quite extensive talks with people in the industry, interest groups, media outlets and corporations, and they have stated that they wish to see this bill passed. The two-out-of-three rule and the 75 per cent reach rule need to be changed. It's very important to people. The media has changed. TV was first introduced in Australia around the 1950s, and it has changed quite considerably over the period of time since then. We must move with the changes that have happened. As has been stated in the chamber by other speakers, we are seeing that the internet has made a big impact on media. The money that media organisations were making is now taken by internet sales, so the current situation is not reflective of what is happening in newspapers and television. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is very important to a lot of people. We're hearing that a lot of media outlets are shutting down and journalists are losing their jobs. This needs to be addressed. It concerns me that those on the other side of the chamber, the Labor Party, agree with the two-out-of-three rule and are supportive of it, and yet they won't work towards helping media organisations that are struggling and people who are losing their jobs with regard to this. As I said, we have had extensive talks with the government. What we have brought to their attention, I think, will make a big difference with some of the organisations. What we've raised before is to do with the ABC and community radio, which needs a helping hand. It is struggling. People in rural and regional areas need assistance as well. One Nation will be raising the issues in my further discussions on the floor of parliament with regard to this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a grave concern with the American company CBS buying up Channel 10, if that be the case. Foreign ownership of our media is of grave concern to me. I will talk further about that later on. Information on the remuneration packages of ABC presenters over $200,000 needs to be made available to all Australians, because the taxpayers are paying for this. We will also be addressing the $12 million going into community radio stations over the next four years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I rise to speak on matters of importance to all creatures great and small. Last week I had the pleasure of joining Jason Wood MP, the member for La Trobe, to relaunch the Parliamentary Friends of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the RSPCA. Also with us was Gary Humphries, the chair of RSPCA Australia; its CEO, Heather Neil; RSPCA chief scientist Dr Bridda Jones; and veterinarian Dr Bronwyn Orr, who was there to answer all our animal and pet related questions. Their generosity with their time and expertise was critical to the success of the event—that and, of course, the animal-shaped cupcakes!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Friends of the RSPCA existed in previous parliaments under the chairmanship of then Senator Gary Humphries, among others, but had lapsed in recent times. So Jason Wood and I have committed the newly relaunched friendship group to some important goals, including supporting the prevention of cruelty to animals, both in Australia and internationally; promoting in parliament the work of the RSPCA and raising community awareness regarding the humane treatment of animals; encouraging the Australian government to promote animal welfare nationally, enact new legislation where required, and work with industry and RSPCA Australia to establish appropriate standards for animal care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Parliamentary friendship groups of the RSPCA have a long history in this place, it is as nothing compared to the history of the RSPCA in Australia. The RSPCA's Australian beginnings date back to Victoria in 1871, where a public meeting held to discuss the ill-treatment of horses led to the formation of the society. The RSPCA was established to promote animal welfare. It is an extraordinary organisation created by the community and driven by strong community support. This is no doubt partly because, at 63 per cent, Australia has one of the highest rates of pet ownership in the world. Thirty-nine per cent of Australian households, like Jason's, own a dog, while 29 per cent of households, like mine, own a cat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the RSPCA is one of the most trusted and respected charities in Australia. Amazingly, despite running shelters across the country and employing some 1,000 staff, the RSPCA is funded almost entirely through community donations. It does not just take in and care for lost, abandoned, and abused animals; it also investigates complaints of animal cruelty and provides information to millions of Australians about animal welfare and responsible animal care and pet ownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, as the lucky owner of Benny, the world's most wonderful cat, it pains me to acknowledge that cats remain the biggest issue for the RSPCA. It was an issue brought home to me during the launch as we listened to the presentation of Dr Jones. We heard that over the last two decades around 55,000 cats per year have been brought into Australian RSPCA shelters. That is enough cats to fill an Olympic swimming pool every five years. It is far and away the largest workload for shelters. Unfortunately, although numbers have been substantially reduced, many of these cats are still being euthanased.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cats also remain a major threat to Australian wildlife. According to research by Edith Cowan University, they are implicated in the extinction of at least 20 Australian mammal species or subspecies. The RSPCA has been working hard to reduce this threat by promoting responsible cat ownership through desexing, proper registration, microchipping and containment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the work of the RSPCA in Australia and all of its divisions across the country, and I look forward to the Parliamentary Friends of the RSPCA's next event, where we will bring back the iconic Hounds on the Hill!</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I rise to speak to my Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill. I introduced this bill in the name of Australian patients who are sick and tired, who are angry, at the regulatory nightmare they and their doctors face when they try to access medicinal cannabis. We Greens stand with the many tens of thousands of Australians out there today who themselves are suffering or watching loved ones suffer as a result of the lack of access to these treatments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government brought in their medicinal cannabis legislation last year, after a long campaign from the Greens, we thought it was a step in the right direction, but what has become clear is that this is a facade. Instead of a pathway to access, we have regulation and red tape preventing people from getting access to these treatments that relieve people of pain and suffering. The Australian Greens is a party that is concerned to do something about this on behalf of patients. We know that there is a problem when over 100,000 patients stand to benefit, yet under the government's legislation only 200 or so people have got access to medicinal cannabis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes two small changes. It gives dying patients rapid access to medicinal cannabis when it's prescribed by their doctor. The first amendment makes sure that the government follows through with the will of the Senate which allows for the importation of medicinal cannabis for people with a terminal illness. The special access scheme is designed to allow people to prescribe medicines which aren't yet available in Australia to terminally ill patients, if they believe it is going to relieve them of pain and suffering. By definition, people who are eligible are suffering from life-threatening or terminal illnesses—people with cancers, people who are not getting relief from conventional treatments at the moment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an unprecedented move, earlier this year we saw the Greens supported by the opposition and the crossbench come together to overturn the government's cruel block on this scheme from being used for dying patients. That was a victory for patients right around the country who are suffering. Instead, we saw this government ignore the Senate and indeed threaten importers that they would have their permits revoked if they followed the law. This bill that the Greens are introducing will make sure that the government can't block the importation of medicinal cannabis under the special access scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment, as part of this legislation, makes sure we level the playing field. We've got a burgeoning medicinal cannabis industry in this country. It is very small but it's growing. When these treatments come online, Australian medicinal products will also be made available under this scheme. We know the bill won't fix everything. I was just talking to Olivia Newton-John's partner, John Easterling—he is in the gallery here today—who is a pioneer in this industry in the US. What we've got in Australia is a regulator, through the TGA, that is trying to put a square peg into a round hole. We are 20 years behind the US on this issue. If people manage to get through the maze of regulation imposed by the TGA then they face further hurdles, because what we have is the complexity between federal and state regulation that also needs to be fixed through a national approach. But at least for now, let's make the small changes that relieve people who are dying of their symptoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do so because we know that real people are suffering, people like Suli—a young girl, eight years old, with refractory epilepsy who suffers from hundreds of seizures a day, which has resulted in brain damage. She is not responding to the cocktail of pharmaceuticals but is getting relief from medicinal cannabis. We do it for her and we do it for the many tens of thousands of people and their families who are suffering right now. We will keep fighting so that people have safe and timely access to these medicines. I look forward to the support of this chamber to our legislation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I was going to talk tonight about the Prime Minister, who in recent times has been inclined to resort to rather immature name-calling, and that meant I could talk about things such as his suboptiMAL performance, his abysMAL and cataclysMAL turn as Prime Minister, which has been rather disMAL, as we all can see. I could mention his MALfeasance over such investments in Star Mining and the Solomon Islands forestry logging scandal with which he was involved. While the Prime Minister is inclined to resort to distraction from the problems of his government, I'm going to talk about something that is quite serious. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, we believe that we need to encourage investment in housing, and tonight I want to talk about an issue which is of great concern to many people in my home state of Victoria: the shortage of affordable rental properties, particularly in the inner city areas. We tend to think now of the inner cities as inhabited exclusively by wealthy yuppies and hipsters, but this is far from true. There are still low-income people in these areas, including many students and other young people who have just moved out of home and aren't ready to think yet about home ownership. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These people rely on the availability of houses and apartments at affordable rents which are close to public transport and to their places of work and study. We have seen in recent years a decline in this type of rental accommodation in inner-city areas and an increase in rents to the point where many of these people cannot afford to rent. According to data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services, the availability of affordable rental housing for low-income earners in Victoria is at the lowest level since 2000. In 2007, 30 per cent of rental properties in inner Melbourne were classed as affordable, but now it is less than 10 per cent. In 2012, the National Housing Supply Council projected that the national housing shortfall would increase to 490,000 dwellings by 2021. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2000, rents in Melbourne have risen, on average, by 110 per cent while average incomes have risen by only 75 per cent. It shows a widening gap between incomes and the cost of renting. Although the inner suburbs are generally wealthier than outer areas, this conceals a large number of low-income people who struggle to find affordable accommodation. If you are a student at RMIT, it is not much use to you that rents are fairly low in Melton or Broadmeadows. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor has shown we are prepared to take bold steps to address Australia's housing situation. The most important of these is Bill Shorten's commitment to wind back negative gearing. Negative gearing provides tax incentives for investors and speculators to put money into residential property, inflating prices and making it harder for young families to afford a first home. This has the effect of pushing these people into the rental market, reducing supply and driving up rents for those who need to rent, particularly in inner-city areas. The evidence for that is clear. In the 20 years to 2014, the proportion of households owning their home outright fell from 43 per cent to 30 per cent, while the proportion renting from private landlords rose from 18 per cent to 25 per cent. Negative gearing costs the Commonwealth about $10 billion a year, nearly all of which goes to upper-income earners. It diverts investment into unproductive, speculative housing investment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Henry tax review said the tax advantages from borrowing to invest in a rental property leads to investors taking on too much debt and distorts the rental property market. The National Housing Supply Council estimates there is a shortage of 540,000 rental properties that are both affordable and available. This is partly because many properties, which would be affordable for low-income people were they available, are in fact occupied by people on higher incomes who have been shut out of the home-buying market by the effects of negative gearing. The Hawke government did abolish negative gearing in 1985 but, unfortunately, decided to reinstate it in 1987. Now, 30 years later, Labor has again committed to ending this harmful and unnecessary tax break for property investors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to some claims, the temporary ending of negative gearing didn't lead to a rise in rents. In 2015, the ABC's fact checkers found that Treasurer Joe Hockey's claims about this were incorrect. Rents rose in Sydney and Perth but fell in Adelaide and Brisbane, while not changing a great deal in Melbourne. All these changes were due to local market factors, not the abolition of negative gearing. Why then do I now argue that abolishing negative gearing would ease the pressure on the rental market in inner Melbourne? Because many of the people now renting in these areas would much rather be buying a home but can't afford to. Negative gearing inflates property prices by encouraging speculative money into the market. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I'm going to tell you a horror story tonight—a real life nightmare—about a five-year-old girl raped, with a gun held to her head, raped almost daily by her stepfather, to the extent that when she was nine and started to bleed her grandmother took her to the doctor thinking she was starting her period early. She wasn't; she was having a miscarriage. She was nine years old. Her grandmother told her to forget about it and not tell anybody. The little girl's mother also knew about the abuse and did nothing. The rapes went on and on for years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets worse, if that's possible. When she was 15 her grandfather took her to the police to report the years of abuse, and nothing happened. You see, that little girl's attacker was a Victorian policeman who worked at Hastings police station. During his 12 years in the force Victoria Police failed to act on numerous complaints against him of sexually abusing children in country Victoria. During that time in uniform, he defiled at least nine children, including three stepchildren—kids aged between five and 10—and used his uniform to snare more victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He asked one little boy if he wanted to see inside a police station. He took him there and raped him on a bed inside the building. A young girl dutifully went to the police station for help after losing track of her mother at a local festival. The copper told the child, 'I'll look after you'. Then he took her out the back into a divvy van and forced her to perform oral sex on him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was his stepdaughter who suffered the most. She naively thought that when she started primary school in Tyabb she would be safe. As she said in the victim impact statement years later:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The first time he took me out of school during the day he informed the teacher that I had a dentist appointment. He would show up in his police uniform, police car including his police revolver. All the kids thought it was cool. All I could think about was this is not going to end well. I did not get to the dentist that day. I was taken home where I was abused, raped and threatened to be killed with his police revolver which was pointed at my head. He got off on pretending to kill me more than the sex I think, as it soon became his habit to have the gun resting on my temple. I was then made to have a shower and redress for school and I would be dropped off like a piece of meat at the front gates to walk back to the office and then on to class. This became a regular occurrence and a ritual for nearly 4 years of my primary school. I was always being picked up in the cop car or divvy van. Sometimes we would not head back to the house but to the tennis courts. No one questioned why a cop car would be there. Actually, no one questioned anything as to why I was seeing so many doctors or dentists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One boy who was sexually abused by the policeman in 1979 told his mother, and she reported the abuse to the cop's colleagues. She was persuaded, like other parents, not to press charges. The next day the police went to the woman's house and told her 'the offender wouldn't be in the police force anymore and would be moved away'. And that's what happened. The now ex-cop went to New South Wales where he abused more children over the next four years. For those crimes he was arrested in New South Wales in 2012 and sentenced to 17 years jail, with a non-parole period of 12 years. He was then extradited to Melbourne and last year was sentenced to 19 years behind bars, with a minimum of 15. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is yet another aspect to this horror story. When this child rapist was sentenced, the County Court judge suppressed his name, supposedly to protect the identity of his victims, even though Bianca Hall from Fairfax formally requested it be lifted, even though three of his victims asked the court to name him because they believed more victims would come forward if they knew it was him and he was behind bars, and even though that five-year-old stepdaughter is now 45. The community deserves to know the name of this man, whose stepdaughter has accurately described as a 'monster'. With her permission, I will name him tonight. This monster, protected for years by Victoria Police, is Robert William Gommeson, now aged 67. I hope that naming him will bring some closure for some of his victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will never forget the words of his stepdaughter, who said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There were many times I prayed that I would not wake up in the morning. That somehow during the night my heart would just stop beating and all the hurt and suffering would be over. But it did not. I would hope and pray that I would not have a visitor come into my room and I would be saved from one night of terror and torture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That girl has built an adult life for herself, and has a family of her own now. She approached me recently and asked me to name the stepfather who stole her childhood and her siblings' innocence, as well as the innocence of those other kids. That is why I have named Robert William Gommeson, commonly known as 'Bob', the ever-friendly neighbourhood cop. And I'm going to name the brave stepdaughter too—her name is Tracey May; another victim is Martin Raby—because tonight they are here in the gallery to hear publicly mentioned for the first time the name of a piece of scum who destroyed their childhood but failed in the end to ruin their rebuilt adult lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say tonight: may Gommeson rot and die in jail. Tracey and Martin, I salute you. The community thanks you for your bravery and for your determination.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  It is obviously hard to follow that contribution from Senator Hinch with what I was going to talk about—and I will get to that—but I do know that Senator Hinch's motivation in this regard is always well-intentioned. I hope that those people who are in the gallery are getting the appropriate support they need. I also hope the other victims that Senator Hinch didn't name are comfortable with what he did, but, more importantly, get the ongoing support they need as well. I pass on that from my point of view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the federal Labor country caucus that will be gathering in Rockhampton in a couple of weeks. This will be the second gathering of the country caucus since the 2013 election. It's been a development that has been led by the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon. The first conference of the country caucus was held in Casino in the run-up to the last federal election. This time we are getting in early because we understand there is so much neglect of regional Australia, and particularly regional Queensland, under this Liberal-National Party government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that federal Labor is listening to regional Queensland and listening to regional Australia. You're starting to see a real divide when you get out and about in regional Queensland—I've noticed it myself when I've been getting out and about. The local communities are starting to understand the commitment from federal Labor and, indeed, from federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, to listening to local communities, consulting with them and working with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it so important that federal Labor has this focus? What we know and what we've seen from the National Party is a complete neglect of regional Queensland and regional Australia. You need look no further than the sitting National Party MPs in Flynn, Capricornia and Dawson. All of them have a sorry track record in delivering for their communities over recent years. We can all point to specifics where they have failed, and there is probably no better current example than the member for Dawson around the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. We all know the damage of Tropical Cyclone Debbie and the impact that had on those communities, yet the fight for Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements funding continues. The state government have put up the $110 million to ensure that they meet their commitments, yet the federal government still will not keep up their end of the bargain and stump up the money to ensure that those communities can recover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Capricornia, the federal National Party member continues to fail her community when it comes to the flood levee. Again, we saw the impact that Tropical Cyclone Debbie had on flooding in Rockhampton and the long-term impact that has regularly on that community. But, despite the efforts of the local council, the state government and federal Labor, the federal LNP government continue to bury their heads in the sand on this important project, which would go so far in ensuring that the flooding problem that Rockhampton has is alleviated by the build-up of this levee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="text-decoration:none underline;">Then there is Ken O'Dowd, the federal National Party member for Flynn. </span>His record on jobs is a very sorry tale. We know the issue of the workers' camp that I've spoken about in this place previously, where they have done nothing to ensure that local businesses get the opportunity from those people who are living and working nearby. But also, since the downturn in the mining industry, we've seen a real suffering in the Gladstone community. Unemployment is up and there's a high level of vacant housing. The federal member for Flynn is really asleep at the wheel and failing to deliver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's a really opportune time. The commitment from federal Labor that we have had, listening to local communities, particularly in regional Queensland, is important. This has been led by the federal Labor leader Bill Shorten. He has made numerous trips to regional Queensland since the election. He has done numerous town hall forums, including two in the last month: one in Mackay and one in Bundaberg, which I was lucky enough to be at. It continues this genuine engagement with local businesses, industry, unions, community and local government that you're seeing from federal Labor. That's probably the most pleasing thing from my point of view—that the local government mayors in those regions know that federal Labor is committed to listening to them and working on local solutions. Federal Labor will use this opportunity to continue to formulate the policies that we know can connect with regional Queensland and regional Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265982" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on a topic that is uncomfortable and confronting to many, but one that we must speak about more. For years 'suicide' has been the word we don't want to say and the topic we don't want to touch, but it is a discussion we all need to have. Eight Australians die by suicide every day—that is higher than the national daily road toll—and, for every death by suicide, it is estimated that as many as 30 people attempt suicide. It is nothing short of a national crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Sunday marked World Suicide Prevention Day, a day that encourages all of us to discuss suicide in a respectful and meaningful way. World Suicide Prevention Day tackles the myth that talking about suicide is taboo—the idea being that, if we speak about it, it may encourage other people to end their lives too. But current research suggests that, if we do talk about suicide in a meaningful and responsible way, it can help to tackle the stigma around death by suicide and encourage more people to reach out for help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a few months ago I heard from a constituent whose husband had attempted suicide. She was devastated that he hadn't reached out for help and that he hadn't confided in her before he had tried to take his own life. Tragically, this constituent was also facing financial ruin. Her husband had attempted suicide after his sports betting debts had spiralled out of control. She had no idea that he was a problem gambler, let alone the extent of his addiction. Sadly, her story is not uncommon. Research from Melbourne's Alfred Hospital suggests that, for every five patients that report feeling suicidal, one of them says that it is due to their gambling addiction. Heavy financial losses are also likely to be one of the most common causes of suicide among problem gamblers. And while problem gamblers often have comorbidities, including substance abuse problems and other mental health issues, debt has been identified as the factor most likely to push them to breaking point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in this place nearly a year ago I spoke of my dismay at the slow progress of reform to this nation's gambling sector and the very real and confronting impacts this has had on hundreds and thousands of Australians. I spoke of those who had lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings and their relationships because of their gambling addiction. I also spoke of those who ended their lives because they could not keep chasing their losses. It is clear that we, as policymakers and legislators, are failing those who desperately need protection from this insidious and predatory industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commonwealth, state and territory gambling ministers met last week to discuss reforms to make online betting safer for consumers. Among the measures agreed to include new limits on inducements to open accounts, as well as in principle agreement for the introduction of a register by December 2018 to allow people to self-exclude from all online gambling websites. Consumers will also be able to access regular activity statements to allow them to monitor their online gambling spend. While these are welcome measures, it should not take a year for them to be introduced. The Commonwealth and state governments must work together to introduce these reforms as a matter of urgency. But, sadly, past experience has taught me that I shouldn't hold my breath for that. The pace and reach of gambling reform in Australia continues to be a sad reflection on the lack of political gumption by our major parties. Ultimately, we must remember why we need reform. We must put the health of Australians ahead of the wealth of this insidious industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to end tonight on this important note: there is always help available. Organisations, such as Financial Counselling Australia, can and do provide assistance to those who are struggling with debt. In my home state of South Australia, Pokies Anonymous continues to provide fantastic support to those suffering from poker machine addiction. The National Problem Gambling Helpline is also available to call or provide help online 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Lifeline is another service that operates around the clock to provide crisis support and suicide prevention services to those at risk. If you or someone you know are feeling vulnerable, I urge you, please, to reach out to these or many of the other organisations that are available to help. You do not have to go through this alone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I want to do a shout out tonight—a big shout out—to scientists, especially the world's global climate scientists. Given some of the tragedies we have seen in recent weeks, some of the worst natural disaster and weather events on record, both in the Atlantic and the US and in our own backyard here in Asia, tonight I want to say thank you to the scientists who study and understand our weather and climate systems and try to predict these terrible natural disasters. I want to recognise tonight the important work that you do and tell you that the work that you do is valued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge tonight that the war on climate science—a war declared by some politicians—has had its victims. I know that many of you now see the climate debate as a moral crisis, rather than just a scientific crisis. I know that you see it as a political problem rather than a scientific problem. And I know that, over time, you've faced denial, censorship and intimidation and you've been attacked and undermined, especially by some cynical, short-sighted politicians. I understand that you may think that politics has failed you and our communities and our environment and our economies. But I wanted to highlight tonight that, if there has been a silver lining from the recent tragedies and natural disasters we've seen—natural disasters that have been unprecedented, in many respects—it's that the great work that has been done by climate scientists and scientists at the weather bureau has helped save many, many thousands of lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist</span> this week published an interesting article saying how extreme weather events had quadrupled since the 1970s. While we have seen a significant increase in these extreme weather events, natural disasters, the number of people who have died from these events has decreased significantly since the 1970s. Many of the lives that have been saved, despite the increasing number of catastrophes, come from the skills and expertise of our meteorologists and climate scientists. We have a much better ability to predict where and when extreme weather events will strike and the intensity with which they will strike. This better forecasting ability has led to better early-warning systems and better planning controls, it has allowed better building standards to match likely conditions and, overall, it has saved hundreds and thousands of lives. I reiterate: climate scientists and meteorologists have saved hundreds and thousands of lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate scientists help us with understanding what type and magnitude of changes we need to be expecting and planning for—commonly called mitigation. They both model and observe the climate and they adopt increasingly sophisticated models and computer systems to make accurate predictions of what we are likely to face in the short and long term. It is impossible to underestimate how important the ongoing work of these climate scientists is. Unfortunately, only last year here in Australia, we saw CSIRO, under the leadership of Larry Marshall, fail to value the work of these climate scientists. In fact, nearly 350 of them who actually monitor our weather systems and our oceans were put on the chopping block. I am proud to say that the Greens, along with some Labor senators, on the Greens select committee, got stuck into CSIRO and we managed to get a lot of these job cuts reversed. We also managed to put pressure on the government going to the double dissolution election to set up a new climate centre, which has now been established in Hobart. Unfortunately, the Trump administration in the US is looking at doing exactly the same thing: cuts right across the board to climate science, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—NOAA—and NASA. Trump even wanted to take all the satellites that were studying the weather and just use them for space exploration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important we recognise the work of these people. We thank them and let them know that they're valued and that we will continue to fund scientific research to make sure we understand our climate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  I rise tonight to speak about a dear family friend and a former teacher who, sadly, passed away last month after a long struggle with illness. I imagine that everyone in this place can look back and recall a teacher who made a real difference in their life—a person who inspired them to learn and, perhaps more importantly, a person who believed in them. For me, Don Reid was such a person. He taught me science at Kingscliff High School for four years, from year 7 to year 10. He was unstinting with his knowledge and exacting in his expectations. He combined this with good humour, patience and affection, which is quite an achievement in year 9, as you might imagine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I saw him earlier this year, he was facing his illness with that same good humour and patience. Characteristically, his primary concern was not his own troubles but to inquire about my wellbeing and how I was going. He was, really, a marvellous teacher. As students, he gave us a great deal of freedom to identify questions and problems that interested us, but that freedom was matched with accountability and we were all expected to deliver. Don disapproved of laziness, and intellectual laziness in particular. He epitomised creativity and excellence in public schooling. As the first head of science in the brand-new Kingscliff High School, he quickly realised that the school's location, on the edge of a pristine wetland that drained into Cudgen Creek, presented an incredible teaching opportunity. Much of the curriculum was shaped to apply the principles of chemistry, physics and biology in the real world laboratory that was quite literally just outside our classroom. Don and the team he led fed our curiosity about environmental management, species conservation and plant biology. Some of my funniest memories of my high school years involved traipsing around in the swamp, collecting samples and checking the experiments that we'd established in the wetland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years, Don and his colleagues in the science department won numerous awards for the work undertaken by students in environmental restoration and management. He was also enormously active in the community. He was a person known for his generosity and a clear-eyed sense of the public interest. He was a gold member of Cudgen Headland Surf Life Saving Club and he was much loved in that club. He built his life in the Tweed on his beloved farm at Duranbah. He was a loving husband to Wendy and a loving father to Teddy, Bobby and Anoushka, who were my schoolmates, and he was loved in return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I attended Don's funeral late last month and the Tweed Valley Chapel was overflowing, including many staff and students from Don's teaching days at Kingscliff High School. It was a send-off that properly reflected the great personal integrity and sense of community that characterised Don's life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:59</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to speak about my recent trip to Cape York. I love being out with the people of Queensland and listening. It makes our work here in the chamber much easier. I'm very proud of Queenslanders, and I want to thank everyone in Cape York who hosted me and my staff on Cape York, especially for sharing their stories and their concerns. I want to start by acknowledging and thanking Doris Fred and Oscar Fred, who travelled quite a way to see us in Cairns. I also want to thank Sarah Addo and Mark Green, who came down from the tablelands before we went to Cape York, and I want to thank Jack Wilkie-Jans and Trish Butler. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we started off into Cape York, where we met Bruce Metzger and his wife at the Mount Carbine cafe and had some of the best pies I have ever tasted anywhere. Then we continued on to Lakeland, where we saw a community willing to discuss openly the imminent and dubious wind farm project up there. We listened to Joy and to Annette. We thanked Annette for speaking up in favour but we also thanked the majority who spoke against—Joy; Eric; Stephen, the contractor there; Dave; Tony, the publican; and Russell. I also want to acknowledge Ross Bensted, who has been in touch with us for many months now—in fact, since before I joined the Senate. He has constantly lobbied for industry on Cape York and a fair go for everyone on the cape. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we travelled on to Hope Vale, where we met with Andrew, the principal of the state school there, with his wonderful openness. We thank him for that and we also thank Tammy for sharing her experience. Tammy, a graduate of the Hope Vale school, went away and got a higher education and came back and is now on the staff there. We also met Michael, who loves it there and was not a resident of Hope Vale until recently. Then we went on to Musgrave and met Mary—and a huge steak! I have never seen a bigger steak in my life, and it was absolutely delicious. I can see Matt Canavan licking his lips here. Then in Coen we listened to George Mulley and Jackie—very successful and happy in their store there, a thriving little business. Then we went on to Archer River and we listened to Medina and Brad. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also went to Lockhart, where we listened to Lyn and Stu and heard their forthright views and then had a wonderful time in the cultural centre there listening to Enoch, Joe, Evelyn and Irene—wonderful Indigenous artists up there, who gave us a tour, let us watch them paint for a while and told us what they were doing. Thank you very much for sharing in Lockhart. For their frankness, their practical ideas, their down-to-earth approach, their inspiring, their passion for the community, their confidence and their competence, I want to mention especially Paul Piva, the deputy mayor; Dave Clarke, the CEO; and Noelene in the office. It gave us a lot of reassurance as to what needs to be done on the cape. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Bamaga we met with NPARC councillors Michael and Esmay and also Joseph, Gina and Dee on the phone, and we welcomed their open sharing of their views and issues. Then we met Paddy, Ugari, Shorty and Kees. Shorty introduced us to his granddaughter Magdalena and also Lucinda, a wonderful little baby. Magdalena is so full of joy there living in Bamaga. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On TI we listened to Fiona Pemberton from Border Force, Aaron Smith from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Torres News</span> and Raphael and Jade, who run a wonderful cafe in the foreshore street of Thursday Island, the Ma:Kai Cafe—wonderful service, wonderful food. Then we also listened to Karel who drives for McDonald Charter Boats, the water taxi there. That was an enjoyable ride—a bit bumpy but a wonderful way of getting to TI. Then, coming back down the cape, down the western side, we listened to Wendy at Bramwell and Ken, who introduced us to Geoff, the Bagman, who put on a wonderful show—fantastic singing of Australian songs, international songs, a variety of songs, and some wonderful humour. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will share the rest the next time I get an adjournment speech, but I just want to thank the people of Cape York very much for their hospitality. We had a very informative trip, a very enjoyable trip and a very safe trip. Thank you very much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:04</span>):  I wish tonight to pay tribute to a great contributor to Queensland politics, Alexander Rodney Lockie Wilson—known to most simply as Rod. Rod, unfortunately, passed away last month at just 69 years of age—far too soon for a man who had given much but had much more to give. Rod was a successful pastoralist, an inventor and a great family man. He is survived by his wife Sylvia and their three children William, Zoey, and Eliza. Rod was an unsung hero of Queensland politics, and that is why I want to say a little bit about him tonight: his contribution deserves to be sung. His life is indicative of the thousands of people who are active behind the scenes in politics. They receive no fame and no remuneration, but they work harder than anyone in this game, and sometimes they contribute much more than the professionals. Rod's life, Rod's example, is a tribute to those Australians who are actively engaged in politics and ask nothing for it in return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Barry O'Sullivan, who is in the chair at the moment, gave a beautiful speech last week about Rod. Barry touched on Rod's successful business interests, his community work and his love for his family. I wanted to pay tribute to Rod tonight by touching on how I got to know him through his passion for developing better policies that improve people's lives. I met Rod about three years ago, after I moved up to Central Queensland. Rod was in politics for the right reason: to help people. I got to know him because he wanted to help someone else. Rod had employed the same lady as his secretary for over 20 years. She had reached retirement age and could have stopped working and gone onto a pension, but she wanted to keep working for Rod. Over the years, however, it became harder and harder for her to justify the financial calculus of continuing to work. Given the way our pension system operates and its means-tested nature, she could earn almost as much on the pension as she did working for Rod.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rod wanted to find a solution. He knew that something was wrong with this. Why should someone be penalised for working? He started to develop policy ideas that were kicked around the policy committees of the Liberal National Party. Someone, I think, told him that I might know something about economics, so I got in my car and drove down to the Coffee Club in Gladstone to meet with Rod; the former member for Hinkler Paul Neville and another party member in the area, Ken McGuinness. Rod was passionate from the start. As soon as the meeting started, I knew that I was not going to get out of this lightly. He was the kind of person, like former senator Ron Boswell, who, when he knew something was right, kept driving and driving until he succeeded. Like Ron, I knew he would keep calling and calling me until I delivered what I had promised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is people like Rod and Ron who are the engines of the political system. Their energy, their drive and their persistence overcome the inertia of bureaucracy and get things moving. We began to discuss why Australia's pension system was built like it was. At first, I thought there was not much that could be done—surely, we would have to means test the pension, otherwise it would become unaffordable. But I gave Rod a commitment to look into things, and it turned out that Rod was onto something. The best way I can honour Rod and his memory is to relay to the Senate what Rod was onto. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a comparatively low workforce participation rate for older Australians, at just 12 per cent for those who are aged over 65. This participation rate has increased a little this century, but it seems to have reached a plateau in the past few years. It remains about five to 10 percentage points below countries such as New Zealand, the United States, Japan, Norway and Sweden. Lifting our workforce participation rate for older Australians is probably the single best thing we could do to tackle the economic impacts of our ageing population. A study a few years ago showed that, if Australia had the same mature-aged participation rate as New Zealand, our GDP would be four per cent higher. In per-person terms, that amounts to about $2½ thousand for every Australian, in terms of economic wealth, if we could achieve it. As it stands at the moment, a single pensioner begins losing the pension at the rate of 50 cents in the dollar for every dollar earned over $168 a fortnight. Evidence shows that older workers in Australia are more responsive to changes in wages or their effective tax rates than the general working population. Hence, while policies directed at reducing age discrimination and improving the education skills of older workers have benefits, a substantial lowering of effective tax rates for older Australians could perhaps have the greatest impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question arises: why does a country like New Zealand have a workforce participation rate for over-65-year-olds almost double that of Australia?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is even more remarkable is that about a decade and a half ago New Zealand's older people workforce participation rate was about the same as Australia's. There is evidence that Australian pensioners want to work more. A survey in 2009 found that one in five Australian pensioners had turned down part-time work because they would have faced a cut in their pension. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there are a range of differences between New Zealand's system and Australia's, the key difference is that New Zealand's age pension is not means tested. This means that older New Zealanders do not face the punitive marginal tax rates faced by their counterparts in Australia. Instead, the pension in New Zealand is assessable for taxation purposes, so a pensioner in New Zealand faces the same marginal tax rate as any other worker in the system. It makes some sense that your tax rate should not increase just because you turn 65.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has programs to reward pensioners for continuing to work, and they somewhat offset the high marginal tax rates that pensioners would otherwise face. But a study in 2013 found that these are 'so confusing that they may well undermine the very aim of the schemes'. There is no simple solution here. The New Zealand system would be a radical departure from Australia's and almost certainly would be a more costly one for our budget. Much more work would be required on the best policy options for us in our circumstances. However, the point Rod raised with me and others in the Liberal-National Party was certainly a legitimate one. It is thanks to Rod, and people like him, that our democratic system can respond to the needs of the people, and not the priorities of this parliament alone. The more we listen to people like Rod, the better our system will work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an honour to know Rod, and I want to continue to honour him and his memory. The best way that I can do that is to continue his push for a better deal for older Australians. Rod is greatly missed by his family, but I hope they know that his legacy from his political involvement will live on for many years to come. Vale Rod Wilson.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:11</span>):  I rise this evening to speak about Dementia Awareness Month 2017, which runs for the month of September and aims to raise awareness of the second-leading cause of death in Australia. I would like to start off by commending Dementia Australia, formerly Alzheimer's Australia, on its strong and unrelenting advocacy for the more than 413,000 Australians living with dementia and the estimated 1.2 million people involved in their care. The theme for the month-long awareness campaign is 'you are not alone', which is encouraging us all to better understand dementia. All too often the diagnosis of dementia results in the falling away of friendships and relationships, and, sadly, people living with dementia, their carers and their families can be amongst the loneliest people in the country. We need to look past the often trivialised symptoms of dementia and focus on supporting, empowering and including people living with dementia in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomed the beginning of Dementia Awareness Month last week by calling on the Turnbull Liberal government to take real action and make dementia a genuine priority. Dementia is now the second-leading cause of death in Australia. Dementia is not simply an ageing issue; it is a chronic health issue. It is a condition that affects people, not only in the medical sphere but also with social and economic implications. Quite frankly, it touches all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Economic cost of dementia in Australia 2016-2056</span> report, released in May, showed that the cost of dementia is predicted to rise to $36 billion per year, and the number of sufferers is predicted to double to more than a million by 2056 without genuine intervention. These disturbing figures alone should have served as a wake-up call for those opposite to take action. Disappointingly, there are no new investments for dementia in the 2017-18 federal budget. I do acknowledge the government's investment in research in this area, but what about those living with dementia now? What about those families and carers who are caring for their loved ones? What are we doing? What is this government doing to support those people here and now? Research is obviously essential but it should not be seen as the replacement for investing in dementia care, training and community awareness. If the Turnbull government were truly serious about dementia, it would follow Labor's lead and outline a strategy for dealing with dementia now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside my counterpart, the member for Bowman Andrew Laming, I'm very proud to be one of the co-convenors of the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia friendship group. This morning I hosted a special event to mark Dementia Awareness Month 2017—and I note the apology of Mr Laming, who wasn't able to attend for personal reasons. This year, we were fortunate enough to hear from Sally and Gary Pertzel. Gary is living with dementia, and he and his wife were very kind in sharing their story and the journey that they're taking together. Every time I hear somebody who's living with dementia share their story—usually with their wife or their husband—it is so inspiring. Quite frankly, it inspires me every single day to raise awareness of dementia in our communities and to remind the community that people with dementia are still the same loved ones that they were prior to the diagnosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also very lucky this year to have as a guest speaker Professor Steven Sabat from Georgetown University in the US, who is visiting Australia on a national speaking tour to raise awareness about dementia in the community. Professor Sabat's remarks were so enlightening to those fortunate enough to hear him speak this morning. He was inspiring. He was brilliant in the way that he brought it back down to a very simple level: people who are living with dementia are still the same people who have passions; they're still the loving, caring people they were before. If they had a sense of humour before their diagnosis, they would still have that sense of humour afterwards. It's so critically important that we acknowledge that these are the same people that they were before the diagnosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Sabat said that linking dementia with memory loss can be particularly harmful because it assumes that those living with dementia can't make new memories or be affected by recent events and that it therefore doesn't matter how we treat them or speak to them. But people living with dementia can still make new memories or remember details in different ways. Someone living with dementia may not be able to articulate or recall something that happened, but they will certainly remember how they were made to feel. Recalling something is not the same as remembering. Just because someone fails to recall something doesn't mean they don't remember. Professor Sabat's speech at the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia event this morning was a timely reminder that people living with dementia are more than the sum of their symptoms. They deserve to live with dignity, support and respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my capacity as the assistant shadow minister for aged care, I have the great honour of being able to focus a lot of my attention on this issue of dementia. I've been holding roundtables across the country, listening to those people who are living with dementia and their families and carers and also to the providers who are providing specialised care. So far we've had roundtable discussions in Canberra, Tasmania, Melbourne and, most recently, Perth, and there are more to come. We were very fortunate in Melbourne, when we held our roundtable at what was then the Alzheimer's Australia Victorian office, to have the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, join us. That was only a couple of weeks ago. It was fantastic to have Mr Shorten there so that he could hear firsthand from those who are taking the dementia journey and those who have cared, or are still caring, for their loved ones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to mention a couple of people. I want to note two young women in particular because their loved ones are living with early onset dementia, but they are young, inspiring women. Tara MacDonald looks after her father, who was diagnosed with dementia in his 60s, and she says she's extremely passionate about ensuring that we have not only age-friendly communities but dementia-friendly communities. She's very active on social media. I take my hat off to her and I say, 'Keep up the great work, Tara.' Isobel Burke is 23 years old and cares for her mother, who was also diagnosed with early-onset dementia a few years ago and is now in residential care. Both of these women were able to articulate to us very clearly the things that need to change—the awareness campaigns we need to have in our communities. Both Tara's father and Isobel's mother are still the same parents they grew up loving and the parents who cared for them, but now Tara and Isobel have that role. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a community, as leaders in this parliament and particularly here in the Senate tonight, we need to take heed of the messages from people such as Professor Sabat to understand the people who are living with dementia are still the same people they were before. The longer we are able to have people with dementia living in our communities, being supported in our communities and being supported at home, the longer they are going to stave off the inevitable. It's our responsibility. My family and I certainly have been touched—both my mother and father-in-law died from dementia; my brother-in-law had early-onset dementia. He was 38 when he was finally diagnosed after seven years. So I've walked this journey; and so I'm asking my colleagues to become ambassadors in their own right to talk about dementia and to help me make Australia dementia-friendly. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:21</span>):  I rise tonight to speak about the National Disability Insurance Scheme and young people with a disability residing in aged-care facilities. It is an issue that many of us in this place have a deep interest in, and, in fact, there have been two Senate inquiries around this issue. It's very strongly agreed that young people with disabilities should not be living in aged-care facilities, but at this stage there are still a large number of young people living in those facilities. There are a number of reasons for that, but mostly it is because we don't have enough specialist disability accommodation yet. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is supposed to be about choice and control for people with disability and ensuring people with disability get quality services and supports. Their lives are supposed to be better under the NDIS, not worse. However, here is another issue where it looks as though the NDIS is not delivering. The NDIS is taking the approach that it should not fund the required supports for young people in those residential aged-care facilities above what is covered by the aged-care funding instrument, more commonly known as ACFI. The approach that the NDIS is taking is extremely concerning, because it will impact on the health and wellbeing of these young people with disability who are living in aged-care facilities. The reason for this position is the categorisation of the aged-care system as a so-called mainstream program under the National Disability Strategy and under the COAG NDIS principles and, consequently, it is required to deliver the full quantum of supports for younger residents. But ACFI is about the provision of aged-care support for older Australians; it is not for disability support and it is not for rehabilitation. Should the NDIS maintain this position, young people residing in aged-care facilities will be significantly disadvantaged in comparison to those scheme participants living in community settings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you an example of the impact of the NDIS's position by using a case study that has been provided to me. A young, 36-year-old man—I repeat, a 36-year-old man—suffers from brittle diabetes. Sixteen years ago, following a diabetes-induced hypoglycaemic episode, he sustained a profound acquired brain injury, commonly known as an ABI. Since being discharged from hospital, he has been living in a residential aged-care facility in regional Victoria. His ABI has left him vision impaired and unable to communicate. He cannot live independently at this stage, he is PEG fed and he experiences seizures daily. He requires one-to-one assistance from a support worker for all activities of daily living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This person is yet to transition to the NDIS, but requires additional funding and supports than that covered by ACFI. The aged-care facility cannot meet the intensity and complexity of his support needs through the funding it receives from ACFI alone. Currently, he receives additional funding and support through a disability services individualised support package and funding that provides specialist rehabilitation therapy and support-worker training through Victoria's Acquired Brain Injury Slow to Recover rehabilitation program for younger people with acquired brain injury. This additional funding supports this person with the management of his oral hygiene, sensory activities and one-to-one support for all social and recreational activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care facility struggles to provide the level of monitoring and supervision required for his PEG feeds, hydration and medication routine and regular checks of his brittle diabetes. His family ensures that one or more family members visit him each evening to oversee his last PEG feed and settle him for the night. His family maintains this routine out of concern for his safety during this period of peak demand on nursing staff. Based on the position of the NDIS regarding its funding of supports for participants living in aged care, there is concern that when this particular person transitions to the NDIS he will not receive the level of support he currently depends on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The inability of the ACFI to meet the support needs of a young person residing in aged care is the key reason for the deterioration in health and wellbeing of those individuals during their time in such facilities. Residential aged care was never intended to support the different, more intense needs of its younger residents, and it is not resourced to do so. The ACFI provides a maximum of $78,131 per annum for residents with the highest level of need, whereas one specialist acquired brain injury service in Victoria receives some $380,000 per person per annum to provide the supports and services each resident with high and complex needs requires. The NDIS should be funding all reasonable and necessary support—that's what it says in the act; 'reasonable and necessary'—for young people residing in residential aged care. Otherwise, they are failing to comply with section 24 of the NDIS Act. They must change their position as a matter of priority. If you follow the logic of the NDIA, they would keep all young people in nursing homes so that all they have to pay is ACFI and not the proper costs and supports for services for people with disability trying to live independently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start of my contribution tonight, in all the years I've been here talking about this issue—and I know that Acting Deputy President Reynolds cares deeply about young people living in nursing homes—we all have agreed that we need to be transitioning young people with disability who are in nursing homes out of those aged-care facilities. The Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance point out the flawed approach of the NDIS on this. They point out that because this position does not allow the full assessment and funding of reasonable and necessary supports for each individual residing in residential aged care, the NDIS is failing to comply with section 34 of the NDIS Act. They also point out that, by reimbursing the Department of Health for the ACFI, the NDIS becomes the sole supporter of supports for young people in nursing homes and aged care. Because it is the sole funder for scheme participants in residential aged care, the COAG principles to determine the responsibility of the aged-care system no longer apply and cannot be relied upon to inform section 34 funding decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS was put in place, as I said earlier, to ensure reasonable and necessary supports, and to provide choice and control. There is a wide recognition in the community that that is about providing a better quality of life for people with disability. Young people living in residential aged-care facilities are not receiving the supports they need and, in particular, the rehabilitation they need. Senate inquiries have been told that repeatedly. There is an agreement that we should be encouraging young people to be able to move out of residential aged-care facilities. That will be barred to them if their health and quality of life suffers because they are not getting the supports necessary to live and meet their needs in a residential aged-care facility. I beg the NDIA to reconsider their approach to ensure that young people living in nursing homes get the supports and services they need for quality of life; otherwise, the young person that I just gave the example of will not receive the supports that they so desperately need to ensure that they live a decent quality of life and get the rehabilitation they need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:31</span>):  There's one area of public policy currently which differentiates the two major parties: the issue of higher education policy. This is a matter of regret for me, and it is a matter of disappointment that such an important area of public policy is at the forefront of debate, and probably intense debate this week. On one side of the chamber, we see the approach to higher education as an opportunity for budget repair and an opportunity to focus on the benefits to individuals of higher education, in terms of potential earnings over a career. On our side of the chamber, we tend to focus on higher education as a public good and something which benefits not only society as a whole but our economy as a whole, particularly as we move forward into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak with some disappointment on the current state of uncertainty surrounding Australia's university funding arrangements and the shocking cuts proposed by the government. I, like a number of other senators in this place, underwent my tertiary education in the early 1980s for free and, like others in this place, I have had a good, stable job throughout my career. My generation, unlike younger generations, is extremely privileged. We had access to good, reliable employment opportunities, strong unions and a relatively stable political and economic environment. How that has changed over the years. Young people today are being increasingly marginalised and they don't have access to the benefits that I've just canvassed. Rent is expensive, with median rental prices in Brisbane now $485 per week for a two-bedroom apartment, which is almost an entire pay cheque for those living on the minimum wage. The dream of young Queenslanders owning their own home is increasingly out of reach. Access to stable employment with good working conditions is eroding. Wages growth has stagnated. Indeed, wages growth seems to be at historic lows. If we combine these factors with the dynamic nature of modern work and the prospective career changes that young people face, it paints a pretty grim picture for Australia's youth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have four kids, all of whom are entering their young adult lives. I want my kids and the kids of other Australians to have the same opportunities, if not better opportunities, than my generation. Indeed, my children are in a good position: they live in Brisbane, at home, rent-free; my wife and I are both employed full time and my wage as a senator is more than satisfactory. What about the kids who aren't in such a privileged position? What about the kids who are from regional areas? What about the kids from non-English-speaking backgrounds? What about mature-age students who are looking to skill up and change careers because their original profession has become redundant in our modern age? This government does nothing for them. It is not just me that's concerned about these cuts; it's my party; it's my Queensland constituents; it's the majority of working Australians; indeed, it's the university sector themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I completed two undergraduate degrees at the University of Queensland, which is a member of the Group of Eight universities. I note that the Group of Eight, in fact, supported the Abbott government's 2014 cuts to higher education, but even the Group of Eight are now against the cuts that are proposed. When you look at other university networks, you see the same thing coming forward. Executive Director of the Regional Universities Network, Caroline Perkins, said last August that the changes will:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… potentially deter mature-age students. As I said, they're the ones who are juggling work, family commitments, and often studying online or part-time …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But it's also students from low socio-economic backgrounds, potentially school leavers, who may also think twice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If what you want to do is increase participation, these changes are potentially going to have a negative effect. As well as the increased student contribution, one of the more significant measures is the proposal to lower the threshold for repayment of loan debts. This will have a huge impact potentially on low-income families. Further, Chair of Innovative Research Universities, Colin Stirling, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The changes are described variously as modest, they're not modest at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The financial impact on the university sector will be profound.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… will have a negative impact on the quality of the education that … can be provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite these dire warnings from representatives in the university sector, the LNP are pushing ahead with the legislation as early as tomorrow to jack up student fees and cut university funding by $3.8 billion. Labor stand with students and universities and will fight against these short-sighted cuts and fee hikes. Indeed, in my home state of Queensland, numerous universities are facing damaging cuts: Central Queensland University, $30.2 million; Griffith University, $85.6 million; James Cook University, $37.1 million; Queensland University of Technology, $89.8 million; University of Queensland, my old university, $96.5 million; University of Southern Queensland, $37.4 million; and University of the Sunshine Coast, $25.2 million. These shocking statistics, these devastating cuts, equate to $401.8 million over four years. That doesn't augur well for the future of Queensland's public universities. Even more so, the skill shortages that will follow if students don't have access to affordable education will be devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already seeing declining apprenticeships across Australia. In fact, under the LNP Australia has now shed 148,000 apprentices—a decline of 36 per cent. The 2017 budget cut a further $637 million from TAFE training and apprentices. If we combine these funding cuts to TAFE training and apprentices with funding cuts to universities, what hope do we have for the future of our children and the future of our nation? I would like to highlight the bleak picture which the LNP is creating for Australian students, as many of them will be adversely affected by a number of the following decisions: the LNP will or have cut penalty rates from the award conditions relied upon by the lowest-paid workers, often university students; encouraged the termination of agreements onto awards, which undermine wages and conditions; given a $65 billion tax cut to big business, while raising taxes for over seven million workers; cut $3.8 billion from our universities; increased fees for universities and decreased the rate at which repayment for courses occurs; and cut $637 million from TAFE training in the last budget alone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a father, as a senator and as a member of the Labor Party, I cannot support these cruel cuts to our publicly funded universities. I cannot support the reckless abandonment of TAFE and training. The future of our nation depends on students, apprentices and workers having affordable access to quality education so they can develop the skills that they need to succeed in life, to buy their first house, to start a family, to realise that no dream is too big. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the LNP are giving tax cuts to big businesses and millionaires, they want to cut TAFE, make students pay more for university, get bigger uni debts and make them pay them back sooner. These priorities are all wrong for our nation, and I will object to these changes, from now until the next election. </span>

They are somewhere between their former homes and villages and the border with Bangladesh. From 11 August 2017, minority groups have reported on the heavy-handed and violent approach of Myanmar authorities in northern Arakan/Rakhine State.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 25 August, the campaign intensified, as the army retaliated to attacks on police and army positions, claimed by a group calling itself the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. Since then, Rakhine State has seen some of the bloodiest violence since the 1970s. An estimated 5,000 people were killed and over 50 villages destroyed. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper reported that Myanmar's army maintains it is carrying out clearance operations to defend the country against terrorists who attacked 30 police posts last Friday. But fleeing groups say the army and Buddhist vigilantes have unleashed an indiscriminate campaign of killing and burnings. Reports, although unconfirmed, include stories of attacks on villages with machine guns, rocket launchers and helicopter gunships.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Independent verification is almost impossible, as no media, NGO or human rights group have been allowed access to northern Arakan. The only reporting available is from neighbouring Bangladesh. A Rohingya monitoring group, The Arakan Project, said it appeared Myanmar security forces were trying to drive out a large proportion of the Rohingya population, along with ethnic Rakhine vigilantes who were 'actively participating in the burning of villages'.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has highlighted the situation remains 'a textbook example of ethnic cleansing' and has called on the Myanmar government to stop pretending the minorities in Rakhine State are setting fire to their own homes and laying waste to their own villages. I call on the government to provide a textbook example of regional leadership in response to these disturbing reports.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:45</span>):  I also have been deeply shocked to hear the reports about what is happening to the Rohingya people. I wish to share tonight the words of some of these Rohingya people in Sydney. They have a right to be heard. We need to listen and to act on the genocide that is occurring. The first words are from Asma:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">My name is Asma, I am 14 and I am a Rohingyan refugee from Burma. I am writing because what's happening in Burma is something I should not be experiencing or seeing. My people should not be experiencing this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">When I see the news I see my people being tortured, abused and women being raped. Children being slaughtered and burned alive in front of their families. This is something happening to people I know and love as well. My cousin and her husband and child and their whole village were burned alive. I have also lost all of my childhood friends. They have been killed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are Asma's words. I also want to share with you this statement from the Burmese Rohingya community in Australia. It reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our Rohingya brothers and sisters are being massacred as we speak here today. Thousands of civilians: men, children and women, are being: raped, hacked with machetes, shot, burned alive with petrol, and their charred remains are being desecrated and thrown into mass graves. Rohingyas have been massacred and villages razed in over 183 villages from Rathedaung to Buthidaung and Maungdaw. This massacre is being conducted by the Myanmar Army and Rakhine extremist militias acting in concert, and the world remains silent. Australian citizens and residents have been receiving reports from survivors that their mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters are being slaughtered with knives and guns. They have received recent photographs and videos of their friends and families being murdered and their bodies desecrated with fire. This … is being conducted in the crematoria that is the killing fields of Maungdaw, Buthidaung, and Rathedaung. The burning of the victims by the Myanmar Army and the Rakhine extremists serve their twin goals of the regime to instil terror in the survivors and to dispose of the evidence of Genocide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, each victim of these atrocities have a name and a family and the Rohingya community will remember them, and record their names, and document the way that they were murdered and desecrated. The Myanmar Government hides these mass killings from the international community. But the survivor reports show that the Myanmar Army has sought to destroy the Rohingya people by massacring village after village and seeking to extinguish all evidence that they ever lived on this earth. More than 300,000 people have fled in anguish through minefields, mortar and machine gun fire, knowing they will be murdered and desecrated if they remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Burmese Rohingya Community in Australia have been collating the reports of these atrocities. The best available estimate was that 9,000 to 10,000 Rohingya civilians have been murdered by the regime in less than two weeks and more than 183 villages have been burned down. This was the available information as of 7 September 2017.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no international agency better suited to report on the actual death toll of the massacres than the community that has been subjected to it. The Rohingyas voice must be heard at this vital time. On the basis of an interview from the survivors' testimonies, BRCA believes that the Myanmar government planned the current ethnic cleansing in response to Kofi Annan's advisory commission and also as part of the longstanding pattern of massacres of Rohingya that have occurred over at least four decades and intensified since 2012. BRCA indicate that the Myanmar army had surrounded the Rohingya villages after 23 of August when Kofi Annan made recommendations on his advisory commission to be implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They also reported that on 23 August the Myanmar army had started to commit atrocities against villagers. In this context, many Rohingya men and boys tried to defend their families and their villagers in self-defence. They have all been killed. From one village to another, all the males, including young boys under 10, have been separated from their families, tied up and killed. Women and girls have not been spared but subjected to rape, murder and the murder of their husbands and sons. BRCA speculates that this attack by the Myanmar army on 23 August was a provocation under the instructions of the Myanmar government as they feared they would have to recognise the Rohingyas and grant them citizenship, amongst other things, as per Kofi Annan's advisory commission. BRCA also highlights that, after decades of suffering persecution, no stateless Rohingya would jeopardise the chance to be finally recognised as a citizen in their own country and be given basic human and citizen rights. Myanmar's propaganda on fighting insurgents is, therefore, nothing less than preposterous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must listen to the victims and confront ourselves with the images of the desecrated victims and the testimonies of the survivors. It is a one-sided war of extermination by the Myanmar army against Rohingya civilians—every bit as evil as the Cambodian genocide. The world is being asked to look away while the Burmese army and the Rakhine extremists exterminate, extinguish and expel the remnants of the Rohingya people from Myanmar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The international community must take action to stop this massacre against the Rohingya people. The obligation to prevent and punish the crime of genocide is erga omnes. It is an obligation on all to stop the crime of genocide. It is an obligation on the UN signatories to adopt 'responsibility to protect' protocols. 'We demand, on behalf of all humanity, that the Myanmar government stop the killings of the Rohingya people.' That is a statement from the Burmese Rohingya community in Australia, many of whom live in Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another matter, Australia could do more for minorities that live in China, particularly the Falun Gong. Australia, along with 11 other countries, is a signatory to a joint statement, <span style="font-style:italic;">The human rights situation in China. </span>The statement calls upon China to uphold its laws and its international commitments. I share the concerns of increasing numbers of people that state-sanctioned organ harvesting from non-consenting prisoners of conscience occurs in the People's Republic of China. Practitioners of Falun Gong and Uighurs, Tibetans and Christians are being subjected to organ harvesting. The United Nations Convention against Torture has called on China to conduct an independent investigation of claims that Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to torture and used for organ transplants and take measures, as appropriate, to ensure that those responsible for such abuses are prosecuted and punished. The 17-year-old prosecution of the Falun Gong meditation practice by the Chinese Communist Party is a violation of international human rights treaties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand China performs about 10,000 organ transplants per year. There are 165 Chinese organ transplant centres that advertise that matching organs can be found within two to four weeks. I have to say that this is surprising. China does not have an organised or effective public system of organ donation or distribution, so to be able to claim such figures is quite amazing. The organ transplant system in China does not comply with the World Health Organization's requirements for transparency and traceability in organ procurement pathways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it should also be noted that China has extremely low rates of voluntary organ donation, owing to traditional beliefs. I understand the growing concern about organ harvesting in China is fuelled by the Chinese government's failure to adequately account for the sources of excess organs. The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak, has requested this information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also significant when we consider these disturbing reports that last year the United States House of Representatives passed quite a comprehensive motion about this issue. In part, it demands an immediate end to the 17-year-old persecution of the Falun Gong by the Chinese government and the immediate release of all Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience. It also encourages the United States medical community to help raise awareness of unethical organ transplant practices in China, and it calls on China to allow a credible, transparent and independent investigation into organ transplant abuses. This is where I think that these recent developments in the United States, with regard to the passing of this 2016 motion, do give some pointers to what Australia could do and how we could do a lot more on this very troubling issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another matter closer to home, on the Saturday just passed, local government elections were held in New South Wales. These local government elections certainly bring out a lot of colour in many areas and some really considered issues. In recent years there has been a real push by the Liberal government in New South Wales to bring about forced amalgamations. There have been a number of corruption issues. We still have the very serious problem that real estate agents, developers and property speculators can stand for local government. But, barring all those problems, there was a huge showing of people deeply committed to their local community, running on some excellent platforms and out there working really hard to win the votes of the local people so they could represent them on council.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do very warmly congratulate the Greens election teams that worked hard in 45 councils across New South Wales. This wasn't all the council areas, because some of them had been done in previous years, but the results are very pleasing for the work of the Greens Party. Generally, we saw that the Liberal Party did not do well, which I think is indicative both of how they operate at a local council level and also of this issue of forced amalgamations and how out of touch the Berejiklian government is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On my own home turf around Waverley, we had the pleasing and very important result that the Liberals were voted out. Sally Betts, who has been the mayor, seemed to have a bit of a magical touch. Her name was always pulled out of a hat, so she became the mayor, even though it was a fairly evenly balanced council. One of the very damaging platforms that they developed was to privatise and further commercialise Bondi Pavilion. Forty years ago, in 1987, we won this against a previous Liberal council under very similar circumstances. It was a Liberal controlled council then under John and Carolyn Markham. They came forward with a similar plan with lots of restaurants—'We'll turn Bondi Pavilion into something that the people want'—not acknowledging how many restaurants are in that area and that Bondi Pavilion is effectively the only town hall, the only community space, we have in the Waverley municipal area that does the most amazing work in terms of music workshops and providing space for dance, physical activities, a whole lot of theatre work and pottery. The place buzzes with activity. Also, there are the tourists and beach-goers who come and go. The council wanted to abuse this centre and be able to lease it out or sell it off to their mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens, who now have a majority on the council, ran on a very clear platform: this is a community centre. Today, it was pleasing that this chamber passed a most important motion calling on the government to fast-track legislation to put in place protection for future generations. In '87 the Liberals came along and tried to privatise it. We saw it again in 2016-17, and again it was an ill-thought out plan. I hope no generation has to fight that again. Bondi is a world-famous beach. It is a heritage building that people love and it serves the local community as well as international visitors. It needs to be set aside as a public building for the future. It is certainly time that was achieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a really big achievement, with a 7.9 per cent swing to the Greens in Waverley. There was a 9.7 per cent swing in Woollahra and a six per cent swing in Hornsby. The issues that we ran on are issues that really resonate with so many people. I had the opportunity to join many of our teams on the election trail, doorknocking, working on pre-polling and working on election day. The talent and the creativity never ceases to amaze me. We're not a party that takes developer donations and we don't take corporate donations. We're fortunate that we have people with dedication and commitment to their local community. That is how it should be for all parties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues we ran on included planning for people, not profits, and putting the community ahead of the developers. That involved some fantastic programs around preserving the precious trees in our community—something that was once taken for granted, but, if you live in Sydney at the moment, you'll see trees being knocked down left, right and centre. It's now an issue that needs clear attention and much stronger protection. The issue of affordable housing was taken up by many of our teams. There is a great deal that local councils can do around ensuring that everybody has a home. We're certainly looking at the issue of empty homes and an empty-home levy for those currently held by investors for capital gains. This is where councils can really make a difference in their own community. Sadly, in Sydney we're seeing the number of people who are homeless increasing. More and more, these people are spreading into different areas as their chances of finding a home become harder and harder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An issue that all our candidates took up—and certainly those who have been elected are very passionate about this—is action on climate change and really looking at a renewable energy revolution. Many of the councils are looking to join together to own solar farms in rural and regional New South Wales. It was in rural New South Wales where we picked up a lot of support. We picked up seats in Wollongong and Newcastle and a number of regional areas in the Central West, in Orange and in Armidale. We already have representatives in Albury and a number of other areas as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that was taken up very strongly by our local people is returning democracy to local government. I was concerned to hear about a number of councils that had removed their precinct committees, particularly once they were amalgamated. It seems that, when councils get to a certain size, they forget that they're there to serve local people and they seem to be more willing—too often—to remove local advisory committees and precinct committees. That's certainly something that I know our newly elected Greens are very keen to work on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that local government elections are a lesson for people like us. We are fairly isolated in this place. But, at a local level, people are very close to what matters to people. Yes, there are always those essential issues about parks, roads and garbage. What also came out in this election—a big one for us and for many of the other candidates as well—were issues that resonate around the nation. This time it was marriage equality. People had their platform for the local election and their plans for local council, but they were also urging people to make sure they voted for marriage equality. All this talk about local councils should not do anything outside their own area is so out of touch. I'm looking forward to working with our new councillors. I congratulate them very warmly and, in fact, congratulate everybody who was elected. Everybody works pretty hard to get onto local council.</span>
