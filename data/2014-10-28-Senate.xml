                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 is bill is the second national security bill brought forward by the government in this parliament; the first, the National Security Legislation Amendment (No. 1) Bill, was passed through the parliament on 1 October. Labor insisted on a full review of that bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security; and we supported the bill, subject to the government implementing each of the committee's recommendations. This bill is of a very different nature to the first bill. Labor's shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, said of that bill in his second reading speech in the other place:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of the measures in the bill are largely uncontroversial, though worthy, adjustments to intelligence legislation, including updating ASIO's employment framework, improving ASIO's ability to work and share information with other organisations, enabling ASIS to better cooperate with ASIO, improving ASIS's protective security capability while operating in dangerous environments and renaming our defence agencies to better reflect their roles. Though it is perhaps impossible to separate this legislation from current events in public debate, we should be clear that these are reforms intended to endure well after current threats have faded. We should debate their content on that basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The foreign fighters bill contains a very different set of amendments. The first bill updated and adjusted the architecture of our national security organisations in a broad way so that they will be better able to meet present and future demands. The foreign fighters bill, by contrast, directly addresses the threats to Australian security which have arisen out of present circumstances in Iraq and Syria. Where the first bill focused on the structure of our national security institutions in the long view, this bill focuses on the discrete powers most relevant to addressing the immediate threat of foreign fighters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor offered the government its constructive bipartisan support for the first bill and we have offered constructive bipartisan support for this bill. As the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, has said on many occasions, Labor believes that our security agencies and national institutions should have the powers and resources they need to keep Australians safe from the threat of terrorism and we will support the government in providing those powers and resources. However, our bipartisan assistance to the government on matters of national security is never a blank cheque and we have also sought serious changes to this bill. Labor foreshadowed during debate on the first bill that subsequent bills 'may merit a different approach', and this has proven to be the case with regard to the foreign fighters bill. We have sought much broader changes to the foreign fighters bill than we sought to the first billâ€”arising as it did out of a lengthy bipartisan process begun by a Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has fought hard over the past weeks to improve this bill by making sure it actually assists our agencies in addressing the foreign threat and by insisting on necessary safeguards for the fundamental democratic freedoms which characterise our society and our way of life in Australia. We pursued these improvements in the intelligence committee, where Labor members and senators closely scrutinised the bill and tested the case for each new measure. In cooperation with the government members of the committee we achieved 36 substantive recommendations. We pursued these improvements in negotiations with the government in which we have achieved agreement on not just the full implementation of the intelligence committee's recommendations but also yet further amendments to the bill. Now, not satisfied with the government's position on two outstanding matters in this bill, Labor will pursue improvements to this bill through further amendments that we will move in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give context to the improvements to this bill that have been achieved by Labor, it is useful to consider the scope of the bill and the original form in which the bill was first introduced into the Senate. The bill was introduced into the parliament on 24 September. It contains a broad range of measures designed to address the foreign fighter threat and amends more than 20 Commonwealth acts. Much of the bill implements recommendations of the March 2013 COAG review and the second, third and fourth reports of the former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Bret Walker SC. These measures include: a new power for interim suspension of passports; merging the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act into the Criminal Code, and harmonisation with code antiterror provisions; changes to the law of evidence to facilitate the use of overseas evidence in prosecutions of foreign fighters; a new evidence-tampering offence; lowering the legal threshold for arrest without warrant for terrorism offences; new power to seize bogus travel documents; providing for information sharing between AUSTRAC and AGD to help combat terrorism financing; and the introduction of delayed notification search warrants for terrorism offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes other proposals which have attracted more controversy: a new offence for advocacy of terrorism, and the introduction of 'advocacy of terrorism' as a ground for prescription of a terrorist organisation; a new offence for entering or remaining in an area declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs; and an expansion of power to collect biometric information on Australian citizens at airports. Further, in its original form, the bill provided for the extension by 10 years without review of the sunset clauses for legislation empowering the AFP control orders due to expire in December 2015, the ASIO questioning and detention powers due to expire in July 2016 and the AFP preventative detention orders due to expire in December 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at the committee recommendations. The bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, where it was thoroughly scrutinised and debated. The committee sought public submissions and held several public hearings. Labor members worked tirelessly with their government counterparts to apply the level of scrutiny and oversight Australians expect their representatives to bring to bear on legislation of such consequence. The process culminated in the intelligence committee's production of a substantial report making 36 recommendations, many of them calling for significant changes or clarifications. For completeness, and to illustrate to the Senate and to the Australian people the breadth and depth of the changes to this bill that have been achieved, I will set out those recommendations of the committee which call for amendment to the bill. I note that in each and every case Labor has insisted that the intelligence committee's recommendations be accepted and necessary amendments brought forward by the government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to sunset provisions, in its original form, the bill providedâ€”extraordinarily, as I saidâ€”for the extension by 10 years, and without review, of the sunset clauses for legislation empowering control orders, ASIO questioning and detention powers, and preventative detention orders. Incredibly, in fact, there were reports in the press that the government initially wanted to remove any sunsetting arrangements for these powers, and confirm them as a permanent part of our law. Control orders, preventative detention orders, and the ASIO powers are each extraordinary and unprecedented powers introduced in the mid-2000s in response to the September 11 attacks and the Bali and London bombings. Their extraordinary nature is reflected in the fact that the Howard government saw fit to subject those powers to review and have them lapse after 10 years of operation if no legislation was passed to extend them. I note that the then Labor opposition sought amendments limiting this sunset period to five yearsâ€”amendments which, unfortunately, at the time were unsuccessful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intelligence committee, after robust debate, concluded that these powers should sunset two years after the next federal election. It is right and proper that the next parliament be obliged to grapple with these powers again, and to decide on its own account whether their continuation is justified. Labor was not satisfied that the case had been made for such a lengthy extension. It is not acceptable that these extraordinary powers could operate for two decades without being properly reviewed by the parliament. As I said, this bill is aimed at a present threat; Labor will resource our agencies appropriately to deal with that threat, but we will not abandon scrutiny of agency powers properly considered special or emergency measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving onto the reviews, importantly, Labor has ensured that these sunset provisions are accompanied by mandatory reviews ahead of time. As was noted in evidence given to the committee, the whole purpose of sunsetting provisions is undermined if appropriate reviews are not conducted. The intelligence committee recommended that its review of the preventative detention order, control order, and ASIO powers be mandated by statute. What is more, it recommended amendment of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act to mandate reviews of the powers by that body also. It is worth remembering that it was only due to pressure from Labor that this body was retained. Earlier in the year, the Abbott government described this critical oversight office as 'red tape' and sought to repeal it. We vocally opposed that short-sighted cut, and the bipartisan support the committee expressed for the position in its report on the first bill was vindicated by Labor's consistent support for proper oversight mechanisms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking on the first bill, I pointed out that the position of monitor had been vacant since April. At a time of substantial change to our national security laws, that office is still vacant. This is simply unacceptable. Labor calls on the government to appoint an appropriate, credentialled and experienced monitor immediately. This is critical. By insisting on dramatically shortened sunset periods and on statutory reviews, both by the monitor and by the intelligence committee, Labor has ensured that, no matter the attitude of the Australian government in the next parliamentary term, there will be a sober and considered review of these powers ahead of their scheduled sunset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We move onto foreign evidence. Labor has improved key human rights protections in the bill's provisions for the use of overseas evidence in terrorism prosecutions in Australian courts. As we did in regard to the first bill, we have demanded amendments to clarify that torture can never be accepted in any way under our law. As originally presented to the parliament, this bill excluded foreign evidence obtained as a result of torture only where that torture was carried out by public officials. There is no reason why the exclusion should be constrained in this way, especially when we are particularly concerned with regions which may have no readily recognisable state authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended the exclusion be expanded to cover torture by anyone. It also recommended the expansion of the definition of evidence obtained under duress to cover situations where evidence is obtained from a person by dint of threats to their person, their family, their associates or their property. In its original form, the bill had only covered circumstances where a person or their family was threatened. Though we strongly support making foreign evidence easier to use, as it is a critical part of enabling successful prosecutions under foreign incursions offences, Labor also wants appropriate safeguards for the accused. The committee recommended that judges be obliged to warn juries about the potential unreliability of foreign evidence; this is an important way of making sure that trials are fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On biometric collection, the foreign fighters bill includes provisions for the expanded collection of biometric data on Australian travellers. While the legislation expressly provides only for the collection of photographs, the bill as originally drafted allowed the government to expand this to other forms of biometric data, such as fingerprints or iris scans, by mere regulation and without seeking parliamentary approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor voiced its objection to this during the committee process. It is not acceptable that such an expansion of power with serious consequences for the privacy of ordinary citizens could be achieved without new legislation. Indeed, it is worrying that this aspect of the bill only became apparent during the Intelligence Committee's scrutiny. It is a vindication of that scrutiny process that did occur. We welcome the committee's recommendation to remove the ability of the government to prescribe further biometric collection by regulation. We also welcome the recommendation that the privacy commissioner oversee both the biometric database that is provided for in this bill and any future legislative proposals to expand it to other forms of data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On foreign incursions, the bill makes a number of changes to Australia's existing foreign incursions legislation which were recommended by the National Security Legislation Monitor. Appropriately, the bill will roll the Foreign Incursions and Recruitment Act into the Criminal Code and update its provisions to specifically deal with the foreign fighter threat. We welcome those changes along with the improved ability to use foreign evidence and we hope that these improved provisions will allow for successful prosecutions of Australians who engage in lawless conduct in conflict zones abroad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the bill as originally presented was drafted in a confused way. It did not simply implement the monitor's recommendation that the definition of 'engaging in hostile activities' overseas be updated to include terrorist activity as currently defined under Australian law. Rather, it included a new concept: 'subverting society'. As was pointed out in evidence to the committee, this expanded the operation of the foreign incursions provisions well beyond what the foreign incursions provisions were meant to address. It could have seen those provisions address private disputes or petty criminal activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomes the committee's further recommendation that the definition of 'engage in hostile activity' be amended so that it only captures conduct which would be a serious offence under Australian law. The strange legislative language of 'subverting society' was likely to mislead or confuse the public as to what was intended. As the former monitor Bret Walker pointed out during the intelligence committee process, there is no need for this sort of florid language in Commonwealth statutes, which should be drafted in clear and calm terms. A loaded legislative term like 'subverting society' would cause completely unnecessary community agitation when the substance of the provision is aimed simply at terrorist conduct. Labor welcomes both the substantive changes which faithfully implements the monitor's recommendation and the removal of this poor drafting technique. We are pleased to see the government agree to produce a more tightly constrained provision that is drafted in clear language.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On enhanced oversight, across all parts of the bill Labor has sought improved oversight and accountability mechanisms. We believe that our security agencies can only continue to do their important work if Australia's political leaders are willing and able to reassure the communityâ€”and I refer here to every part of our diverse, multicultural communityâ€”that our security agencies are not only appropriate empowered but also appropriately accountable. Of key importance is that the committee recommended that it have the power to oversee not just the Australian Intelligence Community agencies but also the AFP in its counter-terrorist capacity. Labor supports this, as it is right and appropriate for the intelligence committee to be able to hold all agencies involved in counter-terrorism activities to public account. This is especially so given the extension in this bill of AFP powers, including to preventative detention orders and control orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the more controversial parts of the bill, particularly the declared areas and advocating terrorism, I will cover those issues during my contribution to the committee stage and in moving the amendments that have been circulated. In conclusion, I will say that Labor has approached this legislation as a responsible opposition should. We have offered the government our bipartisan support for measures to ensure our national security and that is constructive, bipartisan support. Labor did not, and never would, offer the government a blank cheque on this or any piece of legislation. We have worked hard to improve this bill. We want to make sure that it operates as intended, actually serves to protect our security and is subject to limits and accountability appropriate to the sort of free society that Australia is and must remain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our committee members have worked hard in pursuit of these ends in the intelligence committee process. We have worked hard in pursuit of these ends in negotiating with the government. And when our concerns have not been satisfactorily resolved, we have moved amendments in this place, which we urge the government to consider and to adopt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is proud of its record on national security and we are happy to assist the government in getting this bill right. We thank the government for its willingness to accept so many of the changes that we have asked for, and we hope that in that same spirit of constructive bipartisanship they might accept the two further changes we seek in the Senate today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="200287" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WRIGHT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I rise to speak with a heavy heart about this bill, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. This is a significant and complex piece of legislation which, if enacted, will have long-term impacts on how ordinary Australians go about their lives. These impacts will include whether and where people travel; the circumstances in which people can be detained and questioned by ASIO, Customs officials or the police; and what kind of public commentary on controversial issues is allowed to occur in Australia. The reality is that once this legislation is enactedâ€”once it is on the booksâ€”it is very likely, on the basis of the lessons of history, that it will be very hard to shift. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make one thing clear in this speech, and it is this: this legislation does not target only those with a criminal or terrorist intent. Nor does it carefully pinpoint gaps in the existing counter-terrorism legal framework and then fill them in neatly. This is a bill that will affect many everyday Australians and how they go about their lives. It contains widely drafted, sweeping reforms and makes changes to over 20 existing acts. It introduces a range of new, very serious criminal offences. It extends the scope of many other existing criminal offences, and it significantly expands the range and scope of powers available to law enforcement and intelligence-gathering agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly enough, I received a tweet when I was talking about the need for the scrutiny of legislation. Someone tweeted to me, 'Why do you Greens want to protect terrorists?' I think that is one of the fundamental issues that we need to come to terms with in debating this legislation, because it is not the guilty I am interested in protecting here, it is the innocent. It is actually the Australians going about their lives who will be affected by this wide-ranging, unprecedented change to our laws. Tomorrow these laws may affect me or my child or my neighbour, or someone listening to this speech or reading my remarks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to some of the commentary that I have been putting out in relation to this national security legislation I received a letter from an Australian working abroad, who thanked me for the Greens' work in opposing this legislation, in particular the 'declared zones' offence. This person said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While some people are having theoretical debates about what such provisions might mean, it is all too real for people like me. I am an Australian living and working in the Middle East, many of my friends are aid workers and journalists, and this bill will have serious repercussions for us. If this bill becomes law in its current form, on our return to Australia, we will all be criminals; unless and until we can prove we are not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While in the Middle East I have worked with and volunteered for INGOs â€¦ One has to ask how exactly restricting or criminalising the movements of people like me will make Australia a safer place?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge people who might be listening to this, or reading these remarks, to remember that every time, in Australia, we lose rights and freedoms that are preciousâ€”every time we allow fear to divide us and hurt people who are innocentâ€”terrorism is actually winning. The Australian Greens have consistently said that there must be proper parliamentary scrutiny of this legislation, including a robust inquiry which offers legal experts and relevant stakeholders a genuine opportunity to come to terms with this complex legislation, to analyse it and to provide comment on the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of fear about terrorism the first failure of this government, in carrying out its duty to protect the population of Australia, is in not providing an adequate opportunity for this parliament and the Australian community to even begin to understand some of the most significant counter-terrorism changes in our lifetimes. This has not happened. This is a failure to uphold and protect some of the most dearly held tenets of the democracy that we cherishâ€”in a sense, that we are fighting for here. This is irresponsible and antidemocratic. Already, by playing the national security trump card, by rushing these laws through parliament in the space of two days in the Senate, with inadequate time to consider them and before they have been properly scrutinised by the very committee of this parliament established to safeguard our human rightsâ€”the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rightsâ€”it is possible to say that this government is already allowing terrorism to win, or to start to win.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is pursuing these changes without adequate consideration of the broad range of existing offence provisions and powers that are currently available to such agencies to protect the Australian community against threats to national security, and without a careful analysis of whether each individual reform proposed is a necessary and proportionate response to genuine and legitimate national security concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it is for every other senator in this place, keeping the Australian community safe from harm is my unwavering priority. Of course it is. I live in the community. My family is in this community. My children are here and so are my neighbours and my friends. But I will not pretend that the only way we can keep our community safe is to undermine the rights and processes that make us a vibrant parliamentary democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not agree to amending laws on the run, without allowing the parliament or the community to really understand what they will mean for ordinary Australians. I will not agree that doing that is the best way to guard Australia against national security risks. The Australian Greens support careful lawmaking, particularly when people's lives, rights and liberties are at stake. This means ensuring that the agencies we rely upon to protect us from harm have the tools they need to investigate crime and gather intelligence. But it also means looking at what laws we already have in place, whether they are working properly or need to be improved, and when they should be limited to the most exceptional circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, it means listening to those with experience and expertise. Sadly, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 has been introduced in flagrant disregard of these principles. As a result, this bill risks being at least an ineffective reaction to the national security threat which is faced by Australia, duplicating existing laws, and at worst it risks being a disproportionate intrusion on the rights and liberties of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the lack of scrutiny first. I was really interested to hear Senator Collins' comments. It will be interesting to see how Labor votes this afternoon when there is an hour's motion to gag debate on this bill. If that motion is successful, this Senate will have fewer than eight hours to consider the most significant counter-terrorism laws in my lifetime. The unwarranted haste with which this bill is being pushed through parliament has meant government agencies and Australia's foremost legal experts have not had enough time to provide a comprehensive analysis of the full bill. The communities who were apparently consulted in relation to the draft bill remain deeply concerned with its content and continue to feel sidelined and ignored. Even the government's own expertâ€”the position established for the specific purpose of monitoring our national security lawsâ€”the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, has remained vacant since April, leaving Australia without the source of independent expert advice it needs most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am a member, forewent its capacity to inquire into the bill, although the Senate referred it to that committee. The unrepresentative Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, comprised only of the club, coalition and Labor politicians, with no input from crossbenchers or Independents or the Australian Greens, has had too little time to identify and address the potential implications of these changes on the lives of ordinary Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a lawyer, I remain deeply concerned about the devil yet to be revealed in the detail of this bill. The Australian Greens have a number of concerns about this bill, many of which I will not have time to address during the time allocated. However, I will start with the no-go zone offence. The Australian Greens will seek to abolish the so-called no-go zone provision in this bill which will make it a criminal offence, punishable by 10 years imprisonment, for a person to travel to a declared area. In an extraordinary departure from the type of traditional rule-of-law principles the Attorney-General in this place claims to hold dear, the offence does not include a fault element; it does not include a mental intention element; it does not require the person to be travelling with any kind of criminal or wrongful intent. It effectively allows the executive arm of our government to draw red circles on the world map and put anyone who goes there at risk of criminal prosecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a narrow list of exemptions for 'legitimate purposes', but this will not protect the many Australians who travel abroad every year. A person who has travelled to a declared zone will be subject to a criminal charge and can only effectively defend themselves if they can bring evidence to show that they were in the area solely for one of the listed legitimate purposes. Legally, to start with, that will be extremely hard to do. As the law stands, visiting friends will not suffice. Travelling to give legal advice or for a religious pilgrimage or ceremony is not covered. And, while visiting a family member will be considered a legitimate purpose, being invited to a wedding in another town while you are there and attending would breach the requirement for the purpose to be a sole reason for the travel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This law will have a chilling effect on the freedom of movement of every Australian with relatives or friends in areas that are experiencing, or may in the future experience, violence or conflict. Would anyone here with young children take the risk of visiting a sick mother or father in a declared area if they knew they would have to face a criminal court to prove the legitimate reasons for their travel on their return? It is also worth noting that travelling for business purposes is currently not listed as a legitimate purpose in the bill. This offence has the serious potential to isolate and divide family members, dislocate migrant communities and stifle business transactions with developing nations. The risk is that this will further entrench feelings of isolation and alienation in the very communities we rely upon most in building a safer, more cohesive Australian society. And all this when this offence is considered by legal experts to be completely unnecessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's criminal laws already well and truly cover circumstances where a person leaves Australia to participate in hostile or terrorist activities overseas, as well as circumstances where a person encourages or urges another person to engage in such activities or a person who financially or otherwise supports terrorist or criminal organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's turn to control orders and preventative detention orders. The second area for concern is indeed the extension of sunset clausesâ€”the built-in expiration provisions for various existing powers: control orders, preventative detention orders, ASIO's questioning and detention warrant powers, and certain stop, search and seizure powers relating to terrorism offences available to the police under the Crimes Act. Despite the fact that we are told that this legislation is so urgent that we must consider it within a period of hours in the Senate and get it through the parliament with unwarranted haste, these powers are not due to expire until December 2015 and July 2016. But this bill seeks to extend them further. These powers are exceptional. They allow authorities to operate outside the traditional criminal justice process, because they restrict the liberty of people not charged with, or even suspected of, engaging in a criminal offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of independent bodies, including the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the 2012 COAG review of counter-terrorism measures, have carefully reviewed these existing powers. Both the INSLM and the COAG reviews recommended that the preventative detention order regime be repealed, describing it as being 'at odds with our normal approach to even the most reprehensible crimes', and said that it may be thought to be 'unacceptable in a liberal democracy'â€”but maybe that is not what we are living in anymore. The INSLM also stated that 'control orders in their present form are not effective, not appropriate and not necessary'. Inexplicably, this bill ignores expert evidence in relation to these provisions and precludes the opportunity for further review of these powers by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is required to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of ASIO's questioning and detention warrant powers by January 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as extending the time frame for these powers, this bill extends their reach by making it easier, for example, for the police to obtain and enforce control orders. I cannot say strongly enough: we must not normalise powers that will allow ASIO or the police to detain someone without charge; limit whom they can speak to, where they can go and whether and where they can work; and impact on the lives of their families. We must remember that we are not only talking about Prime Minister Abbott's 'baddies' here; it could very well be a 'goodie'â€”a person getting on with their everyday life in Australiaâ€”who gets caught up in this. If a mistake is made, a suspicion is wrong and someone happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong timeâ€”and we have historical examples of that in Australiaâ€”lives can be destroyed, people can be crushed and our democracy is poorer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to biometric material. This bill contains biometric data provisions that usher in an unprecedented change to the data collected about travellers at Australian airports. I will be moving amendments to remove these sections. No-one has had the time to carefully consider what this change might mean and what impact it will have on the privacy rights of all Australians leaving on international departures, including those who pose no risk to Australia's national security. As presently drafted, these changes could result in giving the green light for the collection and inter-agency sharing of biometric material, which currently includes photographs and face recognition, but could potentially include iris scanning and fingerprints. We just do not know precisely what forms of biometric material will or can be collected, used and shared under these changes and under what circumstances and with whom this material can be shared. Due to lack of time, many experts were unable to provide comprehensive submissions on the impacts of these changes. For these reasons, the Australian Greens will move that the reforms proposed in schedules 5 and 6, relating to the expanded use of biometric material for passenger processing at Australia's border, be removed from the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also introduce amendments in relation to the new offence of advocating terrorism. Many experts have suggested this offence duplicates and unnecessarily expands existing offences while using broadly defined terms that may have unintended consequences. This offence risks capturing legitimate commentary on issues like Australia's foreign policy or political satire whilst at the same time driving those with nefarious intentions underground, making it harder to monitor and investigate real terrorism offences such as supporting a terrorist organisation. To remain one of the world's strongest democracies, we must remain free to strongly criticise the actions of our government, particularly on those matters directly relevant to our nation's place in the world, such as whether we should engage in combat activities overseas or whether Australia should publicly condemn or praise a certain political or violent struggle. Not everyone thinks carefully about their public contributions on matters that invoke passionate responses. It is chilling to think of those among us, from our teenage sons and daughters to favourite online bloggers, who, because of impetuous or thoughtless action with no real malice involved, could be at risk of very serious punishment under an offence like this, which does not specifically define the limits of criminal liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have significant concerns about new powers for the suspension of travel documents and visa cancellations. These clauses give the minister very broad powers with limited oversight and narrow appeal rights. The Australian Human Rights Commission, among others, has pointed out that the cancellation of family and sponsored visas risks violating a range of human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have other concerns about the expansion of powers of customs officials to detain people without charge, the delayed notification search warrants and provisions governing the use of foreign evidence in Australian criminal proceedingsâ€”and we will be speaking further about those in our committee stage amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues raised in this speech merely skim the surface of the Australian Greens' grave concerns with this bill. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has not yet even finished its consideration of this bill and is still waiting for responses from the Attorney-General to deal with deficiencies in the mandated statement of compatibility provided with the bill. But it is fair to say that Australia has a proud history of protections and freedoms that it has inherited from hard-fought reforms in British democracy. When the government seeks to take away freedoms including freedom of movement, freedom of expression, right to freedom and freedom from arbitrary detention, it is essential that the legislation is subject to rigorous scrutiny. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  I rise to make a short contribution in the five minutes I have available to the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I can assure Senator Wright and other senators in this place that there has, in fact, been robust and deep scrutiny of this bill. The committee listened to a wide range of witnesses and, importantly, also to the evidence provided by the security agencies, who work tirelessly on behalf of the people of Australia to ensure our security and also to ensure that we meet our security obligations to the broader global community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it into context, on 24 September this year the United Nations Security Council met and passed a unanimous motion. The resolution requires all 193 UN member states to prosecute and penalise people who travel or attempt to travel abroad for terrorism training or to help finance such efforts; to deny entry to anyone they have reasonable grounds to believe could be supporting or participating in terror related activities; and to share airline passenger information records and other personal details with international databases to help track and prevent the movement of suspected foreign fighters. It is only the sixth time in 70 years that the Security Council has met with heads of nations. It met in those times to address the most urgent threats to peace and security. We see here that whilst there are urgent threatsâ€”and we are seeing those play out both on the global stage, particularly with the events in northern Iraq and Syria, and in Australia, as we have seen just recently in Melbourne, as well as in Canada and the United Statesâ€”there are emerging and changing threats from people who support the ideology of Daesh or the Islamic state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security scrutinised these bills and made 36 recommendations. As Senator Collins pointed out before, it was a bipartisan effort whereby members from both the government and the opposition looked at the bill and made suggestions as to how to improve it so that we could capture the operational effect that the agencies need to ensure the safety of Australians but at the same time increase the balance to make sure that essential freedoms are preserved and that there are checks, such as sunset clauses, so that these do not without due cause become a permanent feature of our legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to quickly address some of the key points that have raised concern. One is the issue of advocacy. One of the problems in the past has been that people who had been seeking to inculcate in young, impressionable minds the mindset that this is something that is not only permissible but required by their ideology had been very smart and very clever to walk a fine line to avoid the current law which would capture them. We are seeing that we have a generation of people who have been inculcated to a point where the process from that inculcation to actionâ€”to that radicalisationâ€”is very short. And it is quite important that we have the ability to circumvent and to prevent those enabling conditions such that we do not have this body of young peopleâ€”or, in some cases, older peopleâ€”who have been radicalised to the point where they can decide to act and very quickly move forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen a number of cases in which the so-called hate preachers have walked that fine line, they have inculcated into minds the willingness to act, and this legislation is a way of preventing that. Importantly, they commit an offence if they 'intentionally counsel, promote, encourage or urge the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence' and the person is reckless as to whether another person will engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence. There are a number of things in there, particularly the 'reckless' element, that are important and that provide protections from a free-speech perspective. Importantly also, there is a safeguard in that there is an existing defence for acts that are done in good faith, such as political communication or publishing a report or commentary about a matter of public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sunset clauses, as we talked about, are important measures, and we have reduced the time frames on those to make sure they do not become a continuing feature of our law. But the arrest thresholds are an important part, as we have seen, with increasingly the change from large groups with complex plans seeking to have mass casualty events. We have had a very good record in Australia of our existing laws enabling our security forces to have things like Operation Pendennis, in which we defeated the threat against the MCG in Melbourne. Now we are seeing people operating as small groups or individuals very quickly, with no great planning required in terms of their equipment. It is important to change the threshold to enable our security officers to act in a timely manner so that they can apprehend people and prevent those occurrences. So the threshold is being changed to require that an officer of the law has reasonable grounds to suspect, rather than the threshold of reasonable grounds for belief. This is not arbitrary. Some factual basis for the submission must be shown. It is also important to recognise that this is not a new concept in Australia, with many states and territories already having an arrest threshold that is based on suspicion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of biometric measures, we have seen a case in which somebody left Australia, with manual checking at an airport, and went and joined terrorist fighters overseas. We already use biometric measures for people coming into Australia. Many would be familiar with eGate. This legislation provides the ability to use that same technology outbound. It meets the obligations that we have signed up to through the United Nations. It means that we can use existing technology, existing privacy safeguards, on outgoing as well as incoming passengers to prevent the kind of occurrence we saw in Australia before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will make one final comment, on declared areas. This is not an offence of strict liability. The DPP still has discretion as to when to actually bring a case against an individual. So, if there is a range of background factors and other information that is in the brief and the DPP cannot for whatever reason use another law, this measure provides an opportunity to bring a case against an individual who has travelled to a declared area. But for a declared areaâ€”somewhere like Mosulâ€”witnesses were questioning, during the public hearings on this, why somebody would not be free for example to go and do language training. As I put to those witnesses, in the case of an area like Mosul, where every reasonable person has either fled or has been executed through decapitation or crucifixion, what reasonable person would seek to travel there to do education training? It just does not make sense. And because this is not a strict liability offence, all the people who were talked about in terms of journalism and foreign aid workers would not automatically be captured when they came back, because whole regions are unlikely to be declared areas. In fact, specifically, countries are not going to be able to be declared areas. So this offence is not the dire restriction on freedom of movement that has been claimed. Because it is not strict liability, the DPP has a discretion to include it as part of a brief of evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My time is about to expire, but I commend this bill to the house. It has had good scrutiny by the process that has been set up by this parliament, which has worked well for many years through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and I commend it to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I rise to speak against the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. I do so because I do not believe that the bill is urgent or even necessary and also because it contains measures that, like the previous national security legislation, erode our rights and freedoms. It is somehow fitting that this chamber is close to empty because it reminds us of Edmund Burke's observation that bad things happen when good people do nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the government snapped to attention in response to video threats made by a 17-year-old jihadist from Bankstown. I then attracted some attention when I used some mildly unparliamentary language to describe him. I stand by that description. And, for that and other reasons, I do not believe there is any reason to give security agencies additional powers to prevent those like him from causing harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard constant claims that we are now operating in a changed security environment where Australia is under threat. Because Daesh is enjoying success in Iraq and Syria, and a sympathiser has perpetrated an atrocity in Canada, the argument goes, we should all be hiding under the doona and giving ASIO and the AFP additional powers to protect us. I say that is not so. This bill has nothing to do with defeating Daesh in Syria or Iraq, and it will not keep us safer here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General says that the number of Australians presently involved in the conflict in Syria and Iraq is unparalleled. According to his figures, 160 Australians are currently supporting or fighting with extremist groups. And yet 66 Australians fought in the Spanish Civil War. As a percentage of the Australian population in 1936, more Australians thought helping communists or fascists was a good thing than are currently supporting jihadists. Young men with a thirst for action and too much time on their hands have long joined gangs and become entangled with organised crime. These daysâ€”at least for a fewâ€”it seems violent religion provides an alternative outlet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the basic reality that the government already has substantial powers on the books to deal with any terrorist threat. Apart from the factâ€”as Bret Walker SC often points outâ€”that violence and conspiracy to commit violence have always been crimes, Australia's security agencies have extensive surveillance capacities. They can, for example, obtain data preservation orders that ensure metadata is retained and an individual's activities on the internet can be examined. They can obtain warrants to intercept phone calls. People can be held and compelled to answer questions. Preventive detention orders and control orders, without any crime having been committed, stop people leaving their homes if it is suspected that they might commit a crime in the future. Passports can be cancelled. Some of these powers are so over the top they are already incompatible with a liberal democracy. No case has been made for the need to add to them. In Australia, lightning kills five to 10 people each year; this does not mean our security agencies should have the right to enter our houses to check on us or imprison those who would walk around during storms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have pointed out that Daesh makes sophisticated use of social media and videos deliberately aimed at the young. 'Wouldn't it be better,' I have been asked, 'if watching those videos were made illegal? Wouldn't it be good if we could legislate Hizb ut-Tahrir out of existence?' I have formed the view that the new offence of advocating terrorism, which can be committed by both individuals and organisations, is present in this bill purely to get at Hizb ut-Tahrir and any others like it. It does this in two ways. First, it defines advocacy so as to include the promotion of terrorism. This is broad enough to take in a general statement endorsing revolutionary violence with no particular audience in mind. Second, the offence is drafted in such a way that it requires only that the individual or organisation be reckless as to whether the words in question will cause another person to engage in terrorism. At common law, incitement has always required the element of intent, whereas promotion goes beyond the requirementâ€”also present in incitementâ€”that words ought to act directly on their intended audience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I looked at Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia's website. Of course, ASIO probably already know what we do on our parliamentary computers, but I am letting senators know because it was actually an enlightening experience. Hizb ut-Tahrir, like Daesh, supports a global Islamic caliphate. It seeks the imposition of sharia, including the hudud ordinances. These take in nasties such as stoning people to death for apostasy and adultery. It is difficult to avoid the imputation that, given a choice, Hizb ut-Tahrir would prefer Daesh to the Commonwealth of Australia. The issue, of course, is that making Hizb ut-Tahrir illegal will not stop Daesh's videos being made or distributed or watched. In fact, they are likely to acquire a sort of weird cachet from their very illegality. Lots of youngsters, when adults in authority tell them not to do something, immediately go out and do the opposite. This phenomenon is not confined to Muslims. What proscription and listing as a terrorist organisation will achieve when it comes to Hizb ut-Tahrir is to drive the organisation underground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I like the fact that I can read Hizb ut-Tahrir's website. I like the fact that one of their obnoxious spokesmen turned up on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> and revealed to all and sundry just how uncomfortable he is around independent, educated women. I also like the fact that their public presence exposes them to ongoing scrutiny and forces them to speak, not fight. Sunlight is indeed the best disinfectant. It may be possible to legislate bodies like Hizb ut-Tahrir out of existence but not the sentiments it represents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to the alleged urgency and necessity of this bill, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security was forced to come up with something approaching a review in a fortnight. Labor, of course, is being its usual supine self on national securityâ€”although, to be fair, the recommendations made by the committee are all sound. There is only one problem: they are like putting a bandaid on cancer. Yes, it would be nice to have words like 'encourage', 'promote' and 'advocate' defined with clarityâ€”or at all. It would also be good if the foreign minister could not simply declare entire countries off limits. I agree that the idea of 'subverting society' needs work. But it clearly has not occurred to the Attorney-General that some countries and societies actually make good candidates for subverting: Zimbabwe, for example, or North Korea. I am happy to say that I support the overthrow of Kim Jong-un and Robert Mugabe, and I would not mind if there was a bit of advocating terrorism to achieve that. What does that make me? Even better are the proposals to reel in the lengthy sunset clauses for PDOs and control orders. Instead of 2025 or 2026, they will stay on the books for a mere two years after the next federal electionâ€”about four years, then, give or take. Mind you, that is still a long time for bad law to hang around.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the recommendation, when it comes to unauthorised disclosure of delayed notification search warrants, to take the public interest into account. However, as with the previous national security legislation, this safeguard will only go into the explanatory memorandum, not the bill itself. I may have slept through some of my lectures in law school but I remember enough to know that a court only takes the explanatory memorandum into account when the words of the statute are unclear. And the words in this bill are perfectly clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These kinds of laws will effectively turn our security agencies into various versions of secret police. Last week, News Corp's Lachlan Murdoch criticised the attack on freedom of speech that sailed through this place with the support of both major parties in relation to special intelligence operationsâ€”laws that could see journalists jailed up to 10 years if they disclose information about them. This bill seeks to prevent so-called 'delayed notification warrants' from being disclosed. We are talking about a warrant. One assumes that Lachlan Murdoch will one day be at News Corp's helm. The way things are going, there will be nothing for his journalists to report aside from the colour of Kim Kardashian's knickers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with the acceptance of all the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, we are still left with a bill that enables the foreign minister to declare large swathes of territory no-go areas, allows the AFP to conduct searches without telling anyone about them for up to 12 months, places further constraints on the ability of Australians to speak freely, engages in extraterritorial overreach, and tells journalists they must go to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security if they come across misconduct rather than reporting to the wider public in the normal way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abbott tells us that the 'delicate balance' between freedom and security will have to shift 'for some time to come' in light of the heightened terror risk. What he fails to realise in enacting laws like this one and the national security legislation is that he is curtailing the very liberties that distinguish free countries like Australia. Australia has the rule of law, procedural fairness, the presumption of innocence, free speech and a free media. It is simply not acceptable to give those good things away, surrendering freedom for safety, in response to windy threats from the 'ginger jihadi' of Bankstown. We can do better than that. Giving away freedom for security is like giving your possessions to a thief so you will not be robbed. At the risk of repeating a worn phrase, it would be tempting to call Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten the girly men of personal freedom, but I do not know of any girls who would be intimidated by threats from a spotty youth on YouTube.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young men with limited skills and an aggressive cast of mind have always been attracted to violence and have often committed crimes That those crimes are now sometimes committed in the name of Islam does not make them different from crimes committed in the name of communism or fascism, or even just testosterone. There is nothing unprecedented, urgent or super risky about any of this. The internet has changed many things about the modern world, often for the better, but communists and fascists alike were able to convince Australians to fight in Spain in 1936 without it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I came to write this speech, there were lots of words and phrases I could have used at the outset to describe the foreign fighters bill. I could have called it Orwellian in its desire to put the Australian people under surveillance. When discussing Hizb ut-Tahrir, I could have pointed out that the best response to speech is more speech. I could also have suggested that the government was in the process of tearing up the Magna Carta and depositing the bits in Lake Burley Griffin. I did not use that language at the outset precisely because it has become stereotyped. However, that does not make it any less true. Look at what you are doing to Australia's democratic heritage; and then, in the name of all that is decent, do better.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  I also rise to talk this afternoon on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. I do not have the advantage of having the sunlight shining on me, as Senator Leyonhjelm did throughout his speech, which was indeed pleasant to look at and certainly was a perfect photo opportunity. Senator Leyonhjelm, I will be at some variance with your views in my contribution today, perhaps particularly on the acts of terrorism on dictatorial people in other countries. We share a similar view on many things, as you well know, but today I think we might diverge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first responsibility of government is to the security of its citizens. To deliver on this, the Commonwealth relies on a team of thousands: the military, the state and federal police, and the government agencies and organisations whose people we never seeâ€”those amongst us who run towards the bomb blast when everybody else is running away. We owe Australians all reasonable protections, and we owe these people all reasonable tools to keep the odds in our favour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national security space requires flexibility and adaptability from all those involved, including from legislators. This bill in effect represents the law adapting in response to the ways in which our enemies have adapted in their fight against us. Outlawing the advocacy of terrorism at home is a sensible and necessary measure in a battle where the key recruiting mechanism has been the rhetorical flourishes of charismatic jihad salesmen. We are banning the jihad salesmen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Restricting travel to declared regions is both an investment in our own security and an act of a responsible global citizen. It is an investment in our security because those who travel to fight may bring their war home with them and it is an act of a responsible neighbour because we would otherwise be exporting our national security liabilities to other countries. Removing the passports of those with ill will may be enough to stop them from reaching their intended battlefields, but is it enough to ensure they do not take up the battle here instead?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cancellation of welfare payments for individuals of security concern hardly needs a supporting argument. It will remove the possibility of taxpayers' money being used to fund the very terrorism the same taxpayers' money is being used to combat. That is certainly a sound principle but it is also of great practical importance, because terrorism on the scale of that committed by Islamic State is not cheap. They need money; they need lots of it; and that money has to come from somewhere. Let it not come from here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has cancelled a number of passports to date in order to halt those aspiring to join the terrorism tourism trail. That is the right course of action for Australia's security interests and it is the action of a responsible global citizen. But what happens next? What about the individual who is committed to terror and who is stopped from reaching the battlefield by effective border security but whose aspiration to fight may be far from extinguished? At the very least this leaves our security people with a considerable burden, but a far worse outcome would be one akin to what happened in Ottawa last week. It is reported Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's passport application was declined by Canadian police, who believed he intended to travel abroad to fight, before he attacked the National War Memorial and the parliament of Canada instead. The need for the provisions within this bill is evident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also evident that we should start debating whether we must be much more prepared to imprison those amongst us who want to fight our armed forces overseas, those amongst us with the self-declared intention of overthrowing government and imposing an Islamic caliphate, but who simply cannot reach the battlefield to participate in that fight? What if they seek to conduct the fight here? The evidentiary burden for a passport cancellation is appropriately different to the threshold for arrest and imprisonment, but the risk of jihadists participating in the fight at home is very real. So I suggest that, in addition to the very appropriate provisions of this bill, the time has come for us to debate the appropriateness of being much more inclined to jail the enemy amongst us. I know that this bill has been through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security that Senator Fawcett chairs and that he made a contribution earlier. This process has been scrutinised by both sides of government and the minority parties in this house. I commend the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 to the house on those grounds.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAULKNER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I am delighted that there are so many senators in the chamber to listen to my contribution on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014, which of course contains a broad range of measures designed to enhance the capability of Australia's law enforcement, intelligence and broader protection agencies to protect the Australian community from the threat posed by returning foreign fighters and individuals in Australia supporting foreign conflicts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced into the Senate on 24 September. It was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, both of which reported on the 17th of this month. Even with the short and, I believe, inadequate time available to it, I must say that the PJCIS has worked very hard to examine and scrutinise the bill, and it has done so effectively and closely. The committee made 36 recommendationsâ€”many of them calling for quite substantial changes or clarifications. I understand that the government has now agreed to all the recommendations made by the PJCIS. As a result, the federal parliamentary Labor Party determined at its meeting this morning that it will support this billâ€”but it will, however, propose a number of amendments in the committee stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With more and more legislative changes boosting the powers of security agencies, the requirement for effective external oversight is now critical to maintaining an essential level of trust in the community about agency operations. Today I want to use the opportunity of this speech in the second reading debate on the bill to speak about this issue and to state very clearly the importance of this issue of oversight of our intelligence and security agencies. I believe that the time is right for a comprehensive review of the oversight of Australian intelligence agencies as further security measures are brought into the parliament for consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that there are a number of steps that not only are worthy of debate, both inside and outside this chamber, but also could be readily adopted to enhance our current system. Last Friday, in fact, I posted a paper on my website, which was also posted by the Lowy Institute and published by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span>. That paper recommended eight measures to improve the oversight and scrutiny of our intelligence and security agencies. I do commend these proposals to the Senate and, as I said, I intend to take the opportunity of this second reading debate to outline some of these proposals to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the parliament to which the intelligence agencies are accountable, and it is the parliament's responsibility to oversight their priorities and effectiveness. The Australian parliament has no better or more authoritative forum than the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Joint Security, the PJCIS, to do this job. The PJCIS is established under part 4 of the Intelligence Services Actâ€”the ISA. Schedule 1 of the act contains detailed provisions about the committee's operations and appointment processes. But the provision of the ISA regarding a prescribed balance of PJCIS members between the Houses has, I think, been an unnecessary impediment to ensuring that the best-qualified eligible parliamentarians serve on this committee. I believe this should change to ensure that the PJCIS has the capacity to draw on those parliamentarians with the greatest expertise and experience in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about the role of the Australian Federal Police, which now of course is absolutely central in Australia's counter-terrorism framework. In its report on this legislation the PJCIS, in recommendation 14, proposed that the committee's functions be extended to encompass the counter-terrorism activities of the Australian Federal Police, including, but not necessarily limited to, anything involving classified material. I have been arguing the merits of this proposition for a number of years, and I am pleased that the committee has again proposed that the government move in this directionâ€”as it did in its report in 2010 on the review, administration and expenditure of intelligence agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure comprehensive and consistent oversight arrangements, it is critical that the AFP's counterterrorism elements be added to the list of organisations reviewable by the PJCIS and to achieve this section 29(1) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 should be amended accordingly. Also, currently the Intelligence Services Act stipulates the functions of the committee as review of the administration and expenditure of agencies, including their annual financial statements and in addition, of course, any other matter referred by a minister or resolved by either house of the parliament. I argue that the powers and the access of the PJCIS should be enhanced to include access to more classified information and material, including reports and the classified annual reviews of intelligence agencies so that it can do its job more effectively. Of course, in considering the provision of such additional material, the critical issue arises of where to draw the line. It is clear that some types of information are so sensitive that they should not be provided to the PJCIS, even if the committee were given a broader remit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have outlined in my paper some examples of such sensitive information such as revealing the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source; current or planned operations but not necessarily past operations; revealing the identities of agency staff past and present, unless that requirement was waived by the agency head; technical details of nonhuman intelligence sources including cryptology; data or information provided by another country, unless that other country consents; current vulnerabilities of ICT systems, installations or infrastructures relating to national security; and, technical capabilities which are subject to protection beyond the top-secret level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PJCIS in that report of 2007 proposed that a small working group drawn from relevant departments, agencies and the committee be set up to recommend the types of material which the PJCIS could access, material which should remain off limits and amendments to the ISA enabling any proposed changes for consideration by government. I think this proposal has real merit and I hope to see it implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, currently the PJCIS can only request a matter be referred to it by a responsible minister. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the equivalent parliamentary committees set their own agenda and work programs. It is time for the PJCIS in Australia to be given the power to generate its own inquiries if it believes, following consultation with relevant agencies, that such action is necessary and appropriate. Also, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who provides detailed scrutiny of the legality and propriety of intelligence agencies' operations, must have her office adequately resourced. The government and the parliament must ensure that the resources and level of staffing provided to the IGIS continue to meet the growing demands and responsibilities placed on them by the expansion of the Australian intelligence community and its powers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that the government and the PJCIS regularly review or audit these resources, including the level of staffing and their expertise, within the office of the IGIS. There has been an enhancement recently. That is a good thing but I would argue that the IGIS's annual report should be required to provide a detailed assessment of the adequacy of resources provided to that office and the consequences of any shortfalls if they occur. The government and the PJCIS should provide a response to any such annual assessment. In addition to that, there should be more formalised liaison between the PJCIS and other oversight bodies, of course including the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security but also the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. For example, each IGIS formal inquiry report should be provided to the PJCIS no more than three months after it is presented to the Prime Minister or relevant ministers. It would also be good practice for the committee to receive regular briefings from the IGIS and the security monitor and, where appropriate, from the National Security Adviser, who is based in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to these proposals, I believe there should be strong support for mandatory sunset clauses for controversial legislation. In recent years, in some instances the parliament has used sunset clauses when intelligence agencies have been granted unprecedented powers. These unprecedented powers include AFP detention orders, AFP control orders and ASIO questioning and detention powers. The lifespan of too many such sunset clauses has been far too long and it is simply not possible to predict the nature and extent of terrorist threats over such a long period.</span>

I have an enormous amount of respect for Dr White. Indeed, we used him to do a report into the mess that was left to us by the former Labor government with respect to frigates being several hundred million dollars over budget and several years late. The only real authority in Australia as to where we are at with submarines is inside the defence department. If the Labor Party had done its homework and read and studied what Admiral Moffitt, who was in charge of the program, has been saying for the last several years, it would know the timing is crystal clear. For six years, Labor had done nothing. Indeed, I said this on 8 May 2013. I said this in a number of statements. I said that if the two options left behind by Minister Smith, the son of Collins option and the bespoke Australian design, were real and not fantasies then we would accept the minister at his word. But I have a copy of Labor's submarine design here.</span>

                  </a>  I should also say that there are many people who are giving gratuitous advice in this space who were retained by Defence South Australia. Independent, objective advice is very, very hard to find in this space. That is because I refuse to be drawn by people who are paid to give certain specific answers. I will rely on the defence chief to tell me which way we should go. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What those opposite did was absolutely based on fantasy. There was no plan. There was no contract. There was no design. There was no money, because they took $20 billion out of the program.

The Australian Defence Force's contribution consists of up to 600 personnel including our Air Task Group and a Special Operations Task Group. As the VCDF, Vice Admiral Ray Griggs has said, the Air Task Group in Iraq is one of the most capable air packages Australia has ever deployed. It is also the first completely self-contained air task group we have ever deployed and it is integrating seamlessly into the US led coalition.</span>

Our KC-30A air-to-air refueller has flown 24 missions delivering fuel to Australian and coalition aircraft. These missions have been supported by our Wedgetail early warning command and control aircraft, which plays a vital role coordinating all coalition aircraft. It has conducted 19 missions, accruing 230 flying hours. The CDF has been providing a number of operational updates and has been sensible and judicious with this information to protect our people, but has advised the coalition has the strategic momentum. The adverse effects of air strikes on ISIL are numerous. Apart from degrading ISIL's capabilities, they are affecting their access to revenue, their ability to move freely and resupply their people. Air strikes by the coalition are also having a broader impact on morale and confidence and the notion that ISIL or Daesh is invincible. These air strikes are continuing to make an impact. I want to pause to congratulate our Defence personnel on their superb efforts inside Iraq. I congratulate them.</span>

Defence is now working closely with DFAT and other government agencies to meet the administrative requirements and the mechanics to implement the legal arrangements that have been negotiated. Once these are in place, they will pave the way for the deployment of our special forces. The Australian Defence Force takes force protection issues extremely seriously and is developing appropriate measures to mitigate the risks to its operations and the deployment of our people into Iraq. Our special forces are currently positioned in Australia's main base in the Middle East and are ready to assist the Iraqi security forces to prepare and plan for operations. We want to ensure this is done properly. We do not want to cut corners; and here we are focused on the detail and the prudence going forward.</span>

As we all know, Australia is contributing to degrading and disrupting this terrorist organisation and is one among many. In June Iraq's then foreign minister wrote to the UN Security Council, asking member states to assist with combating ISIL. There are now some 60 nations that make up a coalition of nations, including nations in the Middle East and the Gulf States. Nations contributing to air strikes alongside Australia in Iraq include: the United Statesâ€”obviouslyâ€”the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Other nations are participating in air strikes in Syria. The coalition of nations are all in Iraq at the invitation and request of the Iraqi government, and it is the Iraqi government that is coordinating these operations.</span>

I refer the minister to the CEO of submarine builder TKMS Australia, who told the ABC that TKMS could deliver 12 submarines that met Australian requirements for $20 billion, with the price including 'all the programmatic aspects to deliver the submarine in Australia'. Given that the minister has now been caught out by claiming that there is a capability timing gap if our new submarines are built in Australia, does he stand by government claims that Australian built submarines will cost between $50 billion and $80 billion?</span>

                  </a>  I pause to say that one of the top end requirements is for a tonnage in a submarine of 3,400 tonnes. This is beyond what Collins now is. The Germans, of course, have never built a submarine of those dimensions. That is a very important consideration, and we will engage with TKMS as to what proposals they have and will put on the table. A vital part of that will be where the build is to take place and what cost there is in acquiring our submarine capability. In the last 12 months we have been working assiduously to perfect and to finalise our top end requirements so that we can engage these companies and get the best capability for our Navy. That, at the end of the day, is what this is all about.</span>

We have been bequeathed a boat, the Collins class submarine, that was sold to the Australian public on the basis that it was reliable and low in cost to maintain. It has been little short of a disaster. Indeed, retired Rear Admiral Briggs has been an advocate for a son of Collins. Son of Collins was one of your last remaining options. That was laden with fantasy because no work has been done. At $1 billion a year with one or two boats infrequently in the water, I do not want a son of Collins; I want something that gives Navy some capability, which they have been desperately seeking for such a long time. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Given that the Senate has now heard expert testimony that Australia's future submarines should not be bought off the shelf and can be built in Australia with the capabilities that the Navy needs at a competitive price to taxpayers and in a time frame that would avoid a capability gap, why won't the government and you, Senator Johnston, keep your promise and build our new submarines here in Australia?</span>

You are advocating that we do not learn the lessons of Collins. You are advocating that we go straight down the old Collins path where we take billions of dollars of money and heap it into a program that will be over budget and will be over time schedule but, more importantly, will not provide the capability that we need going forward. We will do this properly. I am very upset when the air warfare destroyer program is $100 million or $200 million or $300 million over book. Labor have no qualms about having an NBN that is $30 billion over book. Thirty billion dollars is what you bring to the table in losses. I am not going to deliver anything like that. We are looking for the best capability that Navy can have. Clearly, those on the other side of this chamber do not like the truth because they never tell the truth. They do not like the truth on this subject. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

How does the government justify contributing $3 billion to the East West Link tollway project in Victoria, including $1Â½ billion already handed over, despite information including the business case remaining secret and it being a project which manifestly will not solve Melbourne's congestion problems when the meltdown in Melbourne's train system yesterday due to antiquated signalling shows that it is public transport that is in desperate need of investment from both state and federal governments?</span>

The coalition government has made an historic investment in the budget to get on with building Australia's infrastructure, bringing investment in infrastructure to $50 billion through to 2019-20. This includes $16.4 billion more than Labor promised in its infrastructure investment program. We are investing $7.6 billion in Victoria alone. The $3-billion commitment to Melbourne's 18-kilometre East West Link will address major transport challenges for Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 September 2014 the Australian and Victorian governments announced the preferred bidder, the East West Connect consortium, to construct and operate the eastern section of East West Link. On 29 September this year a $5.3 billion contract was signed between Victoria and East West Connect to build the eastern section of East West Link. The estimated cost of this section is $6.8 billion. This is real money from a government that is getting on with the job because we are delivering some real action in terms of infrastructure. This includes $5.3 billion for the construction, $700 million for public transport and local road upgrades, $500 million for land acquisitions and $300 million of state project management fees. The Australian government is providing $1.5 billion, with $2 billion from the Victorian government and $3.3 billion from private investment. The Australian government has so far contributed $500 million towards the eastern section. The remaining $1 billion Australian government commitment for the eastern section will be paid over three years from 2014-15. The associated works are expected to commence late this year, and I am very proud of that fact. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am really quite surprised, Senator, that you would be asking the question with the tenor that you are unhappy with this program. This is real money, it is actually starting this year and I have told you how much we are investing. I think the government has an awful lot to be very proud of in getting on with the job in Melbourne, in Victoria. Indeed, this is one example of what this side of the chamber is really all about: getting on with the job and actually making things happen.</span>

However, Infrastructure Australia said in Senate estimates last week that the release of the project's business case would be a matter for the Victorian government. Given that the Senate has three times ordered the production of documents, including the business case, will the government now agree to release the business case?</span>

I will undertake to do that for you. But given my experience with the traffic flows in and around Melbourne and the expansion of that community, I think it is clear that there is obviously a business case for infrastructure money to be put on the table to assist in traffic flows on the East West Link. Can I say, Senator, that Infrastructure Australia is assessing projects which involve Commonwealth funding of at least $100 million and will publish justifications for its recommendations to government. On 4 September, Minister Truss introduced the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 into the House of Representatives to embed this into Infrastructure Australia's legislation. As I am given to understand, it is actually slated for debate this week in the Senate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am delighted to inform the Senate that earlier today I was joined by the Chief Minister of the ACT to announce that the Commonwealth would assist the ACT in its task by providing a concessional loan of up to $1,000 million, to deliver a program to buy back and demolish houses in the ACT affected by Mr Fluffy loose-fill asbestos. This facility will allow the ACT to borrow up to $1,000 million at the Commonwealth interest rate for a period of 10 years, allowing savings of approximately $32 million over the life of the loan. This in-principle agreement will provide certainty for the Mr Fluffy homeowners and residents in the ACT and will assure them that help is on the way and that a program set up by the ACT government will shortly commence. The loan will ensure that the ACT is in a position to deliver a well-structured remediation program over coming years. The ACT will be responsible for the program and its administration. Can I finish where I started by acknowledging the very cooperative approach of all representatives from the ACT in this matter.</span>

We will then, in both parliaments, need to progress urgent legislation and I am sure that all senators and all members of the House of Representatives will assist in that regard, with the hope that this program will be able to commence in January 2015. It is important that this program gets underway as soon as possible and in regard to the detail of the program, as I indicated, that will be a matter for the ACT government to determine. But we have indicated our willingness to provide technical assistance and expert advice from our departmental officers to the ACT to assist them in their endeavours, to ensure that we get a good outcome.</span>

The issue is clearly one within the province of either state or territory governments. It is their responsibility to deal with this issue. However, we were very mindful of the fact that the ACT government, being a relatively small government, did not have the financial wherewithal to easily obtain a loan of $1,000 million. To do so would have attracted a higher interest rate than that which the Commonwealth can command and also may well have had an adverse impact on its credit rating and therefore interest payments in relation to existing loans. So we as a Commonwealth have come to an agreement with the ACT to ensure that a loan facility, under the name of the Commonwealth, is made available at a cheaper interest rate, which will assist the ACT in this issue.</span>

It has helped lift living standards for people right across the world. It will continue to help lift living standards around the world.</span>

                  </a>  My sincere apologies. Only half of the Labor Party and the Greens do not believe in progress. Half of the Labor Party and the Greens want us to move back into a cave and not do anything. On this side of the chamber, and perhaps some people on the Labor side of the chamber, we actually believe in policies to drive stronger economic growth. We believe it is a good thing for people to have the opportunity to get ahead. We believe it is a good thing for people across Australia to be able to aspire to better opportunities and to increased prosperity into the future. The policies pursued by this government are very much a reflection of that. We believe that coal is good and will continue to have a central part in driving economic growth in the future. That is why we got rid of the Labor/Greens carbon tax. We got rid of this impost on households and businesses across Australia that was making Australia less competitive without achieving any beneficial environmental outcomes. I very much thank Senator Waters for that question. I look forward to the supplementary question. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Australian Academy of Science has today slammed the government's Reef 2050 Plan as inadequate to protect the Great Barrier Reef because it represents business as usual on coal ports and because it fails to address climate change. When will this government start listening to the science on climate change and on the reef instead of approving mega coal mines in the Galilee Basin and treating the reef simply as a highway for coal ships?</span>

That is a matter for them. What I can say is that we can actually walk and chew gum at the same time. We can pursue economic growth in a way that is environmentally responsible. Minister Hunt has worked very hard to ensure that we have strong environmental protections at that same time as pursuing a very important economic growth opportunity for Australia. For Queensland and for Australia it is an opportunity of national significance. The previous government was looking at providing approvals there. It is fair to say that Minister Hunt has done an outstanding job in appropriately balancing environmental considerations with the need to pursueâ€”</span>

When it comes to border protectionâ€”but, in particular, to doing it properlyâ€”there are three things that you need to do as a government. The first thing you need to do is to know and acknowledge the policies that actually work. The second thing you need to do is to have the backboneâ€”the spine and the resolveâ€”to implement those policies despite the barrage of opposition that you receive from others. The third thing that you need to do is to have the competence to implement those policies, and that is exactly what we on this side of the chamber have done when it comes to border protection.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at what we have achieved with the coalition's policies. In the last 312 days we have had but one single, solitary venture that came to our shores. Contrast that to a similar period under the former government, where we had in excess of 20,000 people arrive illegally by boatâ€”one single, solitary venture, compared to in excess of 20,000 people arriving here illegally by boat. What do we see, however, from the other side? In the last 48 hours we saw but a mere flirtation with those policies that actually work. In a 'Marles moment', to quote Senator Smith, the shadow minister, in relation to the government's turn-back policy, admitted openly, on record, 'It has had an impact.' I personally think that is an understatement, but at least the shadow minister admitted that the government's turn-back policies had had an impact. He then indicated that Labor may consider taking it to the next election. And we all know what happened then. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But, unfortunately for the shadow minister, it was but a very brief moment of clarity before other Labor figures pulled him aside and said, 'That is not our policyâ€”you need to correct the record.' I have in front of meâ€”and Tasmanian senators will be familiar with this publicationâ€”<span style="font-style:italic;">The Examiner</span>, which reports: 'Senators don't support the policy,' and quotes Senator Singh as saying: 'Turn-backs endanger the lives of those at sea.' Senator Singh, I have to sayâ€”through you, Mr Presidentâ€”that it was your failed policies that endangered the lives of in excess of 1,200 people who died at sea. We also have the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten himself, coming out today and confirming: 'Turn-backs are not part of the opposition's policies.' No turn-backs, no border securityâ€”people smuggling will become rife if those opposite are re-elected to govern. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In relation to the statistics, they bear witness to that fact. The Australian people know that; we know that. The only people who do not know that, and who refuse to admit it, are those on the other side. This is what resolve and consistency has done in relation to Australia's borders. We have effectively stopped the flow of boats. People are no longer dying at sea. In excess of 1,200 people died at sea under the former government's policies. Thousands of children were placed in detention. What are our policies doing? Our policies are ensuring that those children are now released from detention and into the community. In relation to the cost saving to the Australian taxpayer, we have saved them approximately $2Â½ billion over the forward estimates in the budget. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Australian Defence Force is responsible for keeping our country safe and secure. Our Australian Defence Force personnel demonstrate the most extraordinary courage by putting their own lives at risk to keep the lives of all Australians safe and secure, both at home and abroad. The risk of terrorism has increased in recent times and military personnel are being targeted across the world. Our own military personnel are being told not to wear their uniforms in public for safety reasons. The previous Australian Defence Force remuneration agreement from 2011-2014 included a nine per cent increase over three years. The government is currently negotiating a three-year agreement and is only offering our defence personnel an increase of 1.5 per cent per year. Senator Johnston, why is your government trying to shaft the Australian Defence Force by only offering them an increase of 1.5 per cent per year? Do you think this is an acceptable result for Australia's Defence Force personnel?</span>

It was barely touched on. The Commonwealth position taken before the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal reflects the unique nature of military service. The proposed offer to the next ADF workplace remuneration arrangement agreed between the Chief of the Defence Force and the government has been put before the independent Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. On 15 October the DFRT, the remuneration tribunal, heard submissions from the Australian Defence Force, the Commonwealth and service organisations. In accordance with standard practice in complex cases, that decision has been reserved and it would be premature to speculate on the outcome. If agreed by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, the workplace remuneration arrangement will see more than 70,000 permanent and reserve ADF personnel receive an increase in their pay each year for three years. The first pay rise will take effect from 6 November this year and will be paid on 20 November.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed workplace arrangement does not alter the conditions of service for ADF members serving on operations, who will continue to be supported through additional remuneration and preferential tax treatments reflecting the nature of the operations they are undertaking. The proposed workplace arrangement also supports Defence's intention to streamline ADF salaries and allowances and simplify administration for ADF members and Defence. This will be achieved by rolling a range of discretionary leave and other benefits into salary increases which will benefit all ADF personnel.</span>

Australia's Defence Force personnel cannot be paid enough. These people are putting their lives on the line to keep our country safe. Offering a pay increase of only 1.5 per cent per year is effectively a pay reduction as inflation is running at around three per cent. This means the pay of our Defence personnelâ€”diggers, airmen and sailorsâ€”will not keep up with the cost of living, yet I understand that most senior officers of the Australian Defence Force received pay increases of up to 40 per cent over the last two years.</span>

The Parliamentary Budget Office figure of 3.9 per cent average growth for total wages and salaries over the forward estimates does not reflect changes to Defence workforce levels. The claim in the article which I am sure you are drawing your question from that the quantum for operational allowances paid to deployed personnel is linked to base pay is clearly incorrect. That is where I think you have, if I may say so, fallen into a misunderstanding of what is going on. Allowances are not calculated as a loading on base pay and there is no link between the workplace arrangement and operational allowances. Since 1999, Defence has had two distinct allowances payable in operational situationsâ€”international campaign allowance for warlike operations and deployment allowance for non-warlike operations. The quantum of allowances is calculated having regard to an assessment of the level of operational and environmental hazards that exist for each operation.

In addition to cutting the pay of Australia's Defence Force personnel in real terms, the Australian government is also trying to reduce other benefits and entitlements provided to our Defence personnel in order to save money. Senator Johnston, will your government stop trying to shaft Australian Defence Force personnel, pay them what they deserve, and maintain or, even better, increase the entitlements and benefits that they receive?</span>

We are not cutting the pay of ADF personnel. The fact is that the increase that we are paying may not be in line with what you perceive is necessaryâ€”and may I say that, to some greater degree, I share that concern. But, more importantly, I am focused on managing a budget that has been bequeathed to me by probably Australia's most incompetent financial managers in our history. So I, the government and the CDF need to balance budgets in a way that tries to equate to equity for all parties. National security is extremely important. The budget underpins our success in providing security for Australians. That is at the heart of this matterâ€”and I can tell you we inherited a mess.</span>

Let me also clarify for the Senate that what I have announced today are revised implementation arrangements for a measure announced in the budget on 13 Mayâ€”and, of course, that budget measure was to ensure that the real value of the excise on fuel does not continue to fall. Something that might have escaped the Labor Party and the Greens is that the real value of the excise on fuel has continued to fall since indexation of fuel excise was abolished in 2001. Back in 2001 the fuel excise was 42 per cent of the average fuel price; today it is 25 per cent. And, of course, as we speak here today, the Greens, in particular, are advocating a position that the real value of the excise on fuel should continue to fall. Our position on this side of the chamber is that it is an important structural reform of the budget to ensure that the real value of the excise on fuel does not continue to fall, and that it keeps pace with inflation.</span>

And, of course, over time, as our economy grows more strongly, we will be able to generate more revenue for government and that will help us to fix up the mess that the Labor Party left behind and to fix up the mess that Wayne Swan and Penny Wong left behind. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The effect of the law, as it stands, is that, if the fuel excise indexation arrangements are not validated by the parliament, the funds will be refunded to the taxpayer who was responsible for paying the tax in the first placeâ€”that is, fuel manufacturers or fuel importers. That is something for the Labor Party and the Greens to think about. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Yes, I am aware. The other day I was sitting quietly in my office working on ideas on how to continue the efforts to repair the budget mess that we have inherited from our predecessors, and who turned up on television? None other than opposition leader Mr Bill Shorten. What was Mr Bill Shorten promising to the Australian people? That not only would the Labor Party get the budget back to surplus; they would actually get the budget back to surplus sooner than the coalition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Mr Shorten, who was a senior minister in the government that created the mess in the first place. This is Mr Shorten, who is opposing most of our sensible savings measures. This is Mr Shorten, who cannot even convince the Labor caucus to support the savings measures they themselves initiated and banked in the budget. This is Mr Shorten, who is telling us that big businesses generating more than $20 billion a year in revenue should continue to have tax cuts for their investment in research and development. The Labor Party under Prime Minister Gillard and Prime Minister Rudd said: 'That is not appropriate. We should not give a tax cut to businesses generating more than $20 billion in revenue a year.' Not Mr Shortenâ€”Mr Shorten says, 'That's too hard.' We know that Senator Kim Carr, the senator for Pyongyang, rolled Mr Shorten in the Labor caucus. He rolled Mr Shorten in the Labor caucus.</span>

                  </a>  I withdraw. We do know that the Labor senator for Victoria went into the Labor caucus and he rolled Mr Shorten on this particular Labor Party saving. We know that he has been proud to claim that in the past. We know that he has been sitting here in the chamber chuckling when we have made these assertions, because he knows it is true. Here we have got a Labor leader who was part of the people who created the mess and who is not doing anything to help us fix the mess. Here he is claiming that he going to bring the budget back to surplus. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is because, given Mr Shorten's track record so far, he is actually starting from way behind. Eventually it will dawn on Mr Shorten that if he wants to make these sorts of promises, the budget is not actually a magic pudding.

That is because the situation the Labor Party left behindâ€”having inherited a strong budget position, a strong surplus and money in the bank and net interest payments on the back of a positive net-asset positionâ€”is a situation where every year now we have got to put our hands into the pockets of our children and grandchildren, forcing them to pay for our lifestyle today and forcing them to pay for a proportion of our recurrent expenditure year-on-year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is fundamentally unfair because what it means is that down the track our children and grandchildren would have to accept either lower services from government or higher taxes from government in order to pay for the budget mess and the debt and deficit disaster the Labor Party has left behind.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WONG:</span>
                  </a>  I will withdraw 'lie' and replace it with 'mislead'. That is because before the election this member told South Australians that this government, were they to be elected, would build the submarines in Adelaide. Yet today and every day we see him confecting excuses to walk away from that promise. The important point for today is as this, as I said: they are not content with misleading South Australians before the election, because this government, this Prime Minister and this minister are intent upon confecting excuse after excuse to try to justify a broken promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go through some of the excuses which this government has put forward for their broken promise. First, they said that an off-the-shelf submarine would be better and cheaper. The evidence to the Senate committeeâ€”which is not from Labor Party people and not from the South Australian government, but from experts in the fieldâ€”has said very clearly that an off-the-shelf submarine does not have the capability, does not have the range and cannot do the job that the Australian Navy needs. One excuse hits the wall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the government says that we do not have the skills here in Australia to build the submarines. Again, there is evidence before the Senate committee. Also, we know that we have great shipbuilders here in Australia and a great and highly skilled workforce, who have been denigrated consistently by this government. But important evidence before the Senate committee said very clearly that we do have the skills to build the submarines here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third confected excuse to try to justify Prime Minister Tony Abbott walking away from the promise to South Australians is cost. What we have is the government softening people up by backgrounding the media with inflated costs for an onshore build. At the Senate inquiry I attended in Adelaide, Mr Hamilton-Smith got it right when he said that people were being softened up for a broken promise. We had figures such as $50 to $80 billion been quietly backgrounded to the media by the government in an attempt to suggest that an onshore build would be too expensive. That excuse has been demolished as well by public statements by shipbuilders, including the shipbuilder TKMSA in Australia, about whom Senator Conroy spoke in his question. They stated they could deliver 12 submarines that met Australian requirements for $20 billion with the price including all the programmatic aspects to deliver the submarines in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That the final excuse that they have returned to is in fact on a capability gap in terms of the timing of the delivery of submarines. The minister has been trying to suggest that is actually the reason. It is not a broken promise and it is not all the other reasons which have been demolished. Actually, it is the timing reason. Let us remember who has said that the minister is wrong: Dr John White, naval shipbuilding expert and co-author of the Winter review that the minister commissioned. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is still sufficient time available, with adequate contingency, for the competitive project design study to be carried out and to build the future submarines in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commodore Paul Greenfield said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ there does not have to be a capability gap if we get on with it now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That evidence was given on 30 September. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Rear Admiral Peter Briggs, the former submarine commander and head of the new submarine capability team, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our strong recommendation is that we get bids from all four potential contenders and make a sensible, informed choice at that point and that we get on with it â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, we should go to an open tender processâ€”a proper tender process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every excuse that this government has put up for breaking their promise has been demolished by the experts in the Senate committee. And the only thing that South Australians can conclude by observing this minister's answer today and every day is that this is a government confecting excusesâ€”putting up excuses which are flimsy, misleading and untrueâ€”in an attempt to avoid responsibility for yet another broken promise. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

You cut the defence budget by the single largest amountâ€”10.5 per centâ€”since the end of the Korean War. Following your 2009 white paper you cut or deferred some $16 billion. All up, your decisions led to 119 defence projects being delayed, 43 projects being reduced and eight projects being cancelled. </span>

It was blankâ€”as blank as their actions in the preceding six years. Our policy made it very clear that we will make the decisions necessary to ensure that Australia has no submarine capability gap within 18 months of the election.

So, rather than the fear campaign that keeps being waged by those oppositeâ€”rather than wanting to scare people into believing that doom and gloom is around the cornerâ€”our comment is clear: there will be more jobs. There will be more jobs in South Australia. We will make the decisions that Labor failed to make for six years. We will budget to deliver on those decisions, although Labor stripped the budget bare.</span>

Unlike those opposite, who have nothing to stand on, I promise you that by the time of the next election there will be clear evidence that South Australia's defence industry is secure in the futureâ€”far more than it was under those opposite.</span>

They can keep trotting out the statement that we did nothing, even when, in estimates, it was agreed that $200 million was set aside and $70 million has actually been spent on the design and the whole processâ€”they can go through all of thatâ€”but what is at stake here is the honesty of Mr Abbott and Senator Johnston. They stood in front of the gates of the ASC and said that they would build 12 subs in Adelaide. I have stood right thereâ€”in exactly the same spot. I have even shown the Senate the video of Senator Johnston making that promise before the last election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where did they start? The government backgrounded all of the media, saying that the Japanese submarine was much better than the Australian submarine on what we were thinking of. Unfortunately, every expert in Australia who knows anything about submarines turned up at a Senate committee to say, 'That's just not true.' Rear Admiral Peter Briggs, one of Australia's pre-eminent submariners, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Proposing that you go and buy an off the shelf submarine with a 6,000 mile range, itâ€™s worse than a waste of money, itâ€™s an illusion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The experts told us that the government's fantasy about buying existing Japanese submarines was an illusion. That is what the experts said, so the government said, 'Oh dear. That one has hit the fence. Let's move on. Cost!' The next backgrounding the government did of all the media was to say it would cost between $50 billion and $80 billion to build the subs here in Australia. What did the experts queue up at the Senate committee to tell us? What did the companies say? The experts at TKMS wrote a letter to the government to try to head off this shonky decision to hand the submarine contract to the Japanese. They said that they could build 12 new submarines in Australia for $20 billionâ€”not the $50 billion to $80 billion advanced by the government but $20 billion. So, when it comes to their excuses, just do not believe the government's lies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the government started going around the country saying: 'We've missed out on how good the Japanese subs were and we've missed out on the cost, because none of that's true. Skills! Australia doesn't have the skills to build submarines.' Well, unfortunately, what did the experts say about that? BAE, the shipbuilders involved in the AWD project, who had to listen to the government make claims about 150 gross man hours per tonne as a productivity rate, say that they are achieving a productivity rate of 76 gross man hours per tonne. But today, yet again, the minister stands up and says that Australia, based on the AWD, does not have the skills and cannot get the productivity. Do not let the evidence get in the way of the answers from the Minister for Defence in this chamber!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the tender process. Now they are claiming we do not have time because the Collins subs will retire before we will finish building the subs. What does the pre-eminent leading naval shipbuilding expert in this country, Dr John White, say? He is so good that Senator Johnston just received a report that he hired him to write on Australia's shipbuilding industry. What does he say? He says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There is still sufficient time available, with adequate contingency, for the competitive project design study to be carried out and to build the future submarines in Australia â€¦</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I want to follow on from the comments that Senator Birmingham made. I think he was onto something when he was comparing the inaction on the submarines while Labor were last in government to what they were doing on the NBN. They did spend billions of dollars on the NBN and we all saw the results of thatâ€”not much service to people and nothing rolled out, but lots of money spent. We saw no planning on the NBN. After reflecting on hearing Senator Conroy, who is now in charge of the submarine in a shadow capacity for the Labor Party, I thought, 'What would be more frightening? Having a Labor government do nothing on submarines or having Senator Conroy doing a lot? What would be more frightening for us as a nation?' We all saw the results for the NBN when the Labor Party tried to spend billions of dollars, did nothing and wasted money in convoluted contracts, when they clearly did not have a commercial bone in their body in order to sign something which will protect the interests of this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We just saw an example of that. The shadow defence minister of our nation would like to take, as somehow almost tendered documents, statements made on a radio station by a European submarine builder, which are apparently evidence enough of what the budget should be. If this is how the Labor Party put their budgets together in government, maybe it starts to explain a lot about why our budget is blowing out and why they could never hit a deficit target in their whole period in government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CANAVAN:</span>
                  </a>  Apparently it is okay, Senator Gallacher, for us to say that a company has said something on the radio, so it must be a fact. Because someone has said in a radio interview that they could build something for $20 billion, that is now an established fact. That is not the process we are going to take in government. We are not going to rely on evidence from a radio transcript in a $20 billion decision for this nation. The decision is about the defence interests of our nation and will have decade-long consequences on how we can defend our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach that we take when we are going to spend that sort of money, when we make a decision that will be about protecting the interests of our children and grandchildren in this nation, is to take the best evidence from the Department of Defence. They have the experts who are independent and are not working for particular companiesâ€”not that there is anything wrong with that, but everybody of course has their own barrow to push. We need to rely on independent evidence, and that is what this government is doing. We will not be cherry-picking evidence provided by particular people. We will be properly testing it through the process that the Labor Party also used on defence decisions when they were in government. It will be a two-pass process: there will be a first-pass process to go to cabinet and a second-pass process when more due diligence is done. That is what will happen and that will lead to better decisions by our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also listening to Senator Wong. She said that we do have the skills here in this nation to build a submarine. I have been to some of the Senate committee hearingsâ€”I am a member of the Senate economics committeeâ€”and I cannot think of one witness who thought that we can build a submarine alone in this nation. That cannot happen. It did not happen with the Collins class submarines; it is not happening with the air warfare destroyers. We will have to rely on expertise in other countries. Everyone recognises that. The Collins class was a multicultural submarine. It was made up of Swedish design, a US combat system and French propulsion. We will have to do the same with any decision we make in the future. It cannot all be done here, but there will still be plenty of work done in Australia, particularly in Adelaide, as the minister has outlined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish with some evidence that was also presented at one of these Senate committee hearings. It was from Mr Glenn Thompson, who is the Assistant National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union. He put in his submission that the project to replace the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Success</span>, which has just been re-contracted, should have been approved and announced many years ago. I put that to him and said, 'I presume that this means it should have been done more than one year ago.' Mr Thompson replied, 'Absolutely.' So here we have the assistant national secretary of the AWU saying that the Labor Party should have made that decision years ago on that ship, and their own union bodies are damning them for their inaction. The reason that we are in this plot right now is that Labor had six years to do something on this and did nothing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  I rise on the motion to take note of answers by Senator Johnston to questions by Senator Wong and Senator Conroy. It was really pleasing that Senator Birmingham broke his self-imposed exile and contributed to the debate. He has been conspicuously absent in this debate right throughout. But, as normal, his pedigree came to the fore. If you check his resume, Mr Deputy Presidentâ€”I am not sure that you have ever bothered to do thatâ€”you will find that his experience in life is restricted to political office as an adviser and the like. Real-world experience is not all that prominent on his resume, so he did what he was expected to do as a professional politician: he put his hand in his pocket, went on the stump, prevaricated and introduced other topics of no relevance to the critical matter at hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot move in South Australia without realising this is a widely-held and deeply-felt subject. Of the number of telephone calls over a few short weeks from constituents to my officeâ€”I stress these were not from Labor held constituenciesâ€”70.5 per cent indicated that they wanted the submarines built in South Australia; 2.1 per cent indicated that they did not want the submarines built in South Australia; and 27.4 per cent had no view. This is a widely-held and deeply-felt important issue. As Senator Wong correctly put it, the minister has ignored the experts, is misleading the public and is breaking a promise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first point of misleading was when he introduced the AWD project, which he said was several hundred million dollars over budget, but he ignored the fact that the Audit Office produced a very comprehensive report. Part of the reason for those overruns was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Immaturity in the detailed design documentation provided by Navantia, predominantly associated with drawing errors or omissions, contract amendments and late Vendor Furnished Information.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This resulted in 'an average of 2.75 revisions per drawing' and led to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ costly and out-of-sequence rework in cases where construction work already undertaken no longer matched the design.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I will not cop the workforce there being denigrated by anyoneâ€”particularly not this minister saying that they lack productivity. When asked, the Defence Materiel Organisation CEO said that there is 'no lack of productivity' from the workforce. It is 'costly rework' that is driving this loss of productivity on the project. That does not fall within the remit of the people who turn up there every day to do their jobâ€”and do it in a damn good way and in a very efficient manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, Senator Birmingham has come out of his self-imposed exile, but let us look at what has happened with the other Liberal senators in the recent weeks. One South Australian senator broke ranks. My good colleague Senator Edwards, deputy chair of the economics committee, has said the project should go out to open tender. Locking Australia out of the process was like 'not inviting an uncle to a wedding'. Senator Edwards has stepped up and is backing submarines in South Australia. Senator Fawcett has been eminently on the record right throughout this and has had to correct an erroneous report of his position, but he has been, very clearly, on the case and on the job in South Australia. Now I go to Senator Ruston. Senator Anne Ruston said that the government should consider the evidence from expert witnesses. That is not criticism from Senator Wong or Senator Conroy. That is criticism from Senator Ruston. The government should consider the evidence of expert witnesses. It is a bit of free advice to her own government. Then we have the member for Hindmarsh, a Liberal MP, lobbying the PM for the local submarines bill. It is very clear that widely-held, deeply-felt community sentiment in South Australia says: 'Don't break a promise, build the subs here, make them in Australia, manufacture them in Adelaide and keep people in work.' It is a very clear sentiment that I endorse.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Johnston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Rice today relating to the East West Link.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question referred to the $1Â½ billion already being handed over despite information, including the business case, remaining secret and the fact that it is a project that manifestly will not solve Melbourne's congestion problems. This was shown yesterday morning with the meltdown in Melbourne's train system that was due to antiquated signalling, showing that it is public transport that is in desperate need of investment from both the state and the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, in response to my question the minister spoke of contributing money to infrastructure and then proceeded to spruik the benefits of the East West Link, totally ignoring the question about the desperate need for investment in public transport. How can we possibly believe the benefits the government has ascribed to the East West Link when the critical information remains secret? Despite the government having made a commitment to release information, particularly business cases, for any project where the federal government is contributing over $100 million, they have not done that in this case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I asked the minister whether he reconfirmed his commitment and whether he actually believed that this information, including the business case and including cost-benefit analyses, should have been publicly available before the funds were handed over, and I got no assurance at all that this shroud of secrecy would be lifted and no time line for releasing the business case, despite the fact that contracts have now been signed for the East West Link project in Victoria and despite the fact that we now have financial closure on the project. So there are absolutely no commercial-in-confidence issues that mean the business case cannot be released.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to noting that in the other place the minister had said he expected that Infrastructure Australia would be able to release the business case, I also noted that in our estimates hearings last week Infrastructure Australia were saying that they felt the business case would have to be released by the Victorian government. But we have no assurance that the business case is going to be released and no understanding at all as to when we are going to receive this information, despite the fact that $3 billion of our taxpayers' money is going into this project, with no transparent accountability to the community. One can only surmise that the numbers on the East West Link do not add up, or they would be on the public record. If the benefit-cost ratio was positive and robust, we would know about it. Instead, this information constantly has not been released. On the contrary, what we do know about this road is that it is massively unpopular and it is massively expensiveâ€”$18 billion for 18 kilometres of road; that is $1 million per metre. Spending this amount of money means that no money is going to be available for the substantial investments that are needed in our public transport infrastructureâ€”for example, the substantial investments in the new high-capacity signalling that is required in order to stop the breakdowns and to stop the collapse in the whole train system that Melbourne experienced yesterday morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the East West tollway is massively polluting. We know that it is going to result in hundreds of houses being acquired. We know that it is going to result in parkland being destroyed for this new road project. The Senate has ordered the production of documents, including the business case, three times now, and three times they have not been released. What I was trying to get out of my question to the government was when we would be able to get this business case that is so desperately needed so that the information can be on the public record and we can have transparent, accountable, evidence based decision making on these infrastructure projects, rather than dodgy decisions being made in the interests of who knows whoâ€”certainly not in the interests of the community.</span>

                  </a>  My colleague in the other place Jenny Macklin has made some statements around this particular decision, and I feel we have to note it, as well. This indicates a significant backdown from the government around these issues of the budget bills around social services. We could have avoided this process if their negotiations had been handled in a way that did not bring forward the bills in the way they came. This is a budget bill. We had that discussion in the last sitting. We came to this place and it was very clear that there were elements of the bill on these issues that would be able to be negotiated. We came into this place, and then new bills were created overnight.</span>

The other half of all this process, which covered major issues, was able to be put asideâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The Manager of Opposition Business should not necessarily take at face value what Ms Macklin tells her. The government was very prepared to alter the legislation in the Senate in such a way to give effect to the will of the Australian Labor Party. There were elements in the social services package of bills that both the government and the opposition agreed upon and, indeed, the opposition circulated amendments to give effect to the removal of those parts that they did not support. We would have accepted that. However, the opposition did not allow the bill to proceed beyond the second readers. Ms Macklin has fabricated this story that somehow we were not willing to give effect to that which they wanted to achieve. We were; but they wereâ€”I think the technical term isâ€”bloody-minded.</span>

                  </a>  You are being very cooperative here, Mr President. The opposition will be supporting the government's motion to put forward the calendar for next year. We do appreciate that we have had this calendar at this time, which is a good time to actually consider what is going to be happening in the future. We are concerned, though; we do not believe that the hours that have been put forward in the proposed calendar are adequate for the degree of legislation and consideration that this Senate should have in terms of a range of processes that will come before us in the new year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the practice, Mr President, to make sure that the calendar meets the needs of the Senate for open and full debate. We believe that the calendar we have seen does not provide enough sitting time in the first half of next year for what we believe will be a tough time. Again, what will happen is: as important points of debate come before the chamber, there will be a request from the government for us to have extended sitting hours, extended times and variation in hours. As we have said consistently, we believe that it should be in exceptional cases onlyâ€”extraordinary casesâ€”that, because of a particular need and urgency, we have to come back to this place. The way to avoid that happening, and the way to ensure that there is appropriate planning and debate, is to set enough days, enough hours, to respond to the process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be accepting the principle that the government has the right to determine the calendarâ€”there is no debate about that. We will be supporting the motion. But we are putting on record againâ€”and if you go back over hours debates that were held in this place when we were on that side and when the now government was on this sideâ€”there is this acrimony about when there is a need for extra hours and extra days. Our position is: when you are planning the forward plan for the Senate, you take into account the need of the place to consider legislation fully and to have enough time for debate so that we do not have to constantly have recommendations for extended hours and changes to plan which are disruptive. So our position is: of course, we have the calendar in front of us and we are supporting it. But we are just saying that, should the time come that they come back to this place asking for extended hours or more days, we will expect that there will be an urgency and an extraordinary need for that, which would not have been covered if we had had extra days in the calendar ahead. That seems to be a regular process, and I do not understand why there is not an understanding that, if you put out extra time for sitting at this stage around which everyone can plan and around which you can plan other things that are needed, it would be a more effective way of managing the business of the chamber.</span>

                  </a>  You are right; I do have a certain charmâ€”thank you, Senator Moore. There is a fundamental difference, though, I think, to the basis upon which the contributions may have been made when I was in that chair compared to Senator Moore, and that is that when the previous government was in office they were routinely seeking to legislate to breach solemn election commitments that they had given. Therefore, it was appropriate that there was a good deal of time given to making that clear to the Australian people. Another important difference is the fact that when the coalition was in opposition we were very cooperative. In fact, some of my coalition colleagues would often chide me for being too cooperative with the government of the day, but we think that it is important that this place works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not seen a great deal of cooperation from those on the opposite side. We have seen some but not nearly the degree that there should be to make this Senate work. So we think that the days that are presented to this chamber for sittings next year should be adequate if there is appropriate cooperation amongst all parties to get the people's business done. If there is a requirement for further sitting weeks, that will be a reflection of the lack of cooperation of those on the other side of the chamber, and I think my colleagues on this side would certainly hold these truths to be self-evident.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have a number of additional sitting days which are scheduled. We have tried to step away from the practice in previous years of scheduling sitting weeks in weeks where there are Canberra public holidays, which obviously denies sitting time. So we have sought additional Mondays in this sitting program, and I recognise that Senator Moore has stated that the opposition accept that setting the sitting schedule really is a matter for the government of the day, and I appreciate that very much. But I think it is important to say that this sitting schedule that we have put forward can work as long as there is due cooperation.</span>

                  </a>  As it happens, I will not need three minutes, except to say that this is a perennial argument that is had in here. The Greens have consistently argued that we need to schedule more sitting weeks so we do not end up with crowded schedules at the end of each of the seasonal sittings with the extended hours and the frustration everybody has. That is why you should put it up front, and I just want to put on the record how distressing it was this year to have sittings during school holidays. We warned at the time that that would be a very difficult scenario for many people. But no notice was taken of that. I am pleased to note that at least the sitting schedule that has been established for next year recognises school holidays, and I just want to put on the record that that is a critical consideration. People need to think about that in the scheduling.</span>

It makes sense and it makes for more predictable lifestyles if you know exactly what you are doing and you have got time to do it in so you do not end up being squashed at the end of these sitting times by long sitting hours and legislation by exhaustion. It does not necessarily make for the best outcomes.</span>

We will not be opposing this motion, but I would like to place on record that we utterly reject the government's claim that they are committed to improving women's economic empowerment. This government's cruel budget cuts family tax benefits, kicks the vulnerable off welfare, cuts the parenting payment and seeks to impose a GP co-payment. These attacks on women's economic empowerment come after the cuts to the low income super contribution and the plans to water down reporting requirements designed to tackle the gender pay gap. Of course, cutting $7.6 billion out of the foreign aidâ€”the biggest single cut in the federal budgetâ€”and claiming to care for the world's most vulnerable is not a new aid paradigm; it is a heartless joke. We will not be opposing this motion, but we have submitted our own motion which commends the International Day of the Girl Child without politicising the issue or falsifying the government's record.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a democracy that values transparency and accountability, and as a major player in the global extractives market, Australia has a responsibility to ensure that our companies demonstrate best practice revenue transparency. Currently, the legislative framework that governs the conduct of Australian companies overseas is opaque, with many Australian companies the subject of concerning allegations in relation to corruption, bribery, human rights abuses and environmental degradation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are many legislative changes that need to occur to deal with this problem in its entirety, but there are important initial steps that we can and must take immediately. This Bill, the Corporations Amendment (Publish What You Pay) Bill 2014, is the first important stage in this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill creates mandatory reporting requirements for ASX-listed and Australian based extractive companiesâ€”including those involved in oil, gas, mining and native forest loggingâ€”on all financial payments they have made, over the previous year, to any government in whose country they operate, on a project-by-project basis. This is a reform that has long been called for by some of Australia's most prominent and respected NGOs who are members of the Publish What You Pay coalition, including Oxfam Australia, the Australian Council for International Development, Transparency International, and World Vision. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, the extent to which Australian companies self-report this information is very limited. As highlighted by Publish What You Pay Australia's report <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia: An Unlevel Playing Field</span><span style="font-style:italic;">â€”</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Extractive industry transparency on the ASX 200</span>, current levels of voluntary disclosure are very low. Furthermore, in the instances where companies have disclosed information, it is fragmented across country, sub-national and business units. As such, there is a need for far greater clarity, transparency and consistency in the reporting of payments to foreign governments by Australian extractive companies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Among our closest allies, Australia is now being left behind in its reticence to introduce this legislation, and we must catch up. Around the world, countries including the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom are all introducing mandatory reporting requirements for extractive companies, coming together to create a global standard. While they hold their extractive companies to higher standards, Australia lags behind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act was introduced in 2010, with section 1504 of this law requiring all U.S. and foreign companies registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to publicly report how much they pay foreign governments for access to their oil, gas and minerals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the European Union in 2013, EU member states signed 'Publish What You Pay' requirements into law, extending extractive companies to include not only oil, gas and mining companies, but also those involved in logging native forest. The United Kingdom recently completed their consultation on this EU Directive, and is set to have legislation finalised later this year, ready to come into effect in January 2015. Norway has also introduced domestic legislation to activate this EU Directive, with many other member states in the process of developing this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In July 2013, Canada also committed to development of mandatory standards for payments by extractive companies. Like Australia, Canada is heavily involved in extractive industries, and in this example the Canadian Government, the Canadian Publish What You Pay coalition, and the mining sectorâ€”including the Mining Association of Canada, and the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canadaâ€”all came together to develop draft recommendations for mandatory reporting mechanisms. This is an encouraging example of the resources sector working constructively with Government to commit to transparency, and I am hopeful that Australian extractive companies will show their support for this legislation like their Canadian counterparts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Led by this example, Australia must commit to Publish What You Pay legislation. Already we are being left behind in the push toward this global standard. Not only have we failed to implement these payment transparency mechanisms, but we are failing to investigate concerning corporate behaviour overseas. We remain one of the few countries that still permit facilitation payments rather than recognising them as bribes. The OECD recently said they were "seriously concerned" at the lack of effort regarding foreign bribery. We must do better, and this Bill is a first important stage in achieving greater transparency and accountability for Australian companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small"> This Bill establishes for Australia the same standards that have been set already within foreign jurisdictions, establishing similar requirements and thresholds that are being introduced in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. As the Publish What You Pay Coalition in Australia has highlighted, the United States, European Union and Canadian legislation will cover 70% of the global extractive market, including companies that are also listed on the ASX. This Bill would substantially contribute to increasing this global effort, capturing an additional 5% of the global extractive market. As the rest of the world moves forward with this important initiative, we must not be left behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Investment, costs and business benefits</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to improved transparency, this Bill would benefit the investment environment. Both the Financial Services Council and the Australia Council of Superannuation Investors, major players in the Australian investment market, support mandatory disclosure mechanisms like those established in this Bill because they provide more information which members can use to better evaluate risks associated with investments. Similarly, it will enable ASX listed companies to better assess risks associated with pursuing projects in developing countries. This was a key benefit identified by the United Kingdom Government in developing their mandatory reporting legislation. By the same reasoning, as the rest of the world moves toward Publish What You Pay regimes, Australian companies that don't report this data may be viewed as higher risk investments due to their comparatively opaque reporting standards. As the UK Government's Impact Assessment of their Publish What You Pay legislation highlighted, this kind of regime is expected to reap benefits for both business and investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Companies already compile and track the data that would need to be disclosed under the legislation, for themselves and their subsidiaries. Furthermore, as other foreign jurisdictions introduce mandatory disclosure laws, many companies will need to comply with mandatory reporting requirements due to their participation in other stock markets. Estimates of the cost associated with the Publish What You Pay legislation for companies in the EU were estimated to be just 0.05% of their annual revenue in the first year of implementation, and then less thereafter. Given the multibillion dollar profits associated with extractive companies (in the financial year 2011-12, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton made profits of USD 5.8 billion and USD 15.4 billion respectively), and the fact that companies will already have to provide this information under schemes in other jurisdictions, compliance costs are not a barrier to implementation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With Australian firms heavily involved in extractive industries overseas, including in countries where resource extraction is often linked to poverty, instability and corruption, this Bill is an important transparency mechanism. Despite many developing countries having large resource bases, the citizens of these countries often remain in poverty due to corruption and poor governance structures. By improving accountability with this Bill, citizens and civil society groups in these countries will have far greater access to information about payments, and as a result, a far greater capacity to hold their governments to account. For this reason, aid and development organisations around the world including Oxfam, World Vision, Action Aid and many others, back the introduction of mandatory payment disclosure legislation. In their recent report <span style="font-style:italic;">Trillion Dollar Scandal</span>, international NGO ONE identified introduction of mandatory reporting requirements for extractive companies as one of the central ways through which we can stem the billions that flow illicitly out of developing countries every year. This Bill reduces the opportunity for corruption and other illicit activities by requiring the reporting of payments that have previously been in the dark. By promoting better governance through these measures, better social outcomes for citizens of developing nations will follow. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the Publish What You Pay Coalition has noted, the amounts of money at stake are "potentially transformational" with, for example, "exports of oil and minerals from Africa [in 2008] were worth roughly $393.9 billion, nearly 9 times the value of international aid to the continent and over 10 times the value of exports of agricultural produce."</span>

                  </a>  The government will not be supporting this motion. A fundamental part of Australia's immigration system is that people found not to engage Australia's protection obligations and to have no lawful basis to remain in Australia are expected to return to their country of origin. Australia does not remove people where this would contravene our obligations under international human rights instruments to which Australia is a party, including the Refugee Convention. Australia is bound by the customary international law principle of non-interference in the international affairs of other sovereign states. Australia's consular obligations and entitlements under international law do not extend to monitoring the welfare of non-national offshore citizens.</span>

                  </a>  I am aware of the reports of the treatment of Mr Zainullah Naseri by the Taliban. Mr Naseri is a Hazara, who arrived in Australia by boat and spent time in detention before being granted a bridging visa. He was deported after his application for refugee status was rejected. It has been reported that he was abducted by the Taliban while travelling from Kabul to his home district of Jaghori. His kidnappers are reported to have tortured him for two days before he seized an opportunity to escape. This is an extremely distressing story and it is proper that the immigration minister has ordered an investigation. Labor urges the minister not only to ensure that the investigation is conducted in a comprehensive and timely manner but that the findings are made public. We are also concerned that he has made statements that may appear to prejudice the results of the investigation. The minister has been reported as sayingâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  I find it extraordinary that the first and only person forcibly returned to Afghanistan under this government has been found to have been tortured upon return, so much so that the minister has, rightly, called for an investigation. Yet we see here today the government refusing to accept that halting the forced returns of others might indeed be a good idea, given they could not guarantee the safety of the only one person whom they have so far sent back. There is an investigation underway. The government know that something happened that should not have happened. They know it is dangerous there and here we have the government blindly wishing to continually dump Hazara refugees back in Afghanistan to face torture by the Taliban. I do not know what the opposition are going to do on this motion. I suspect they did not want this going to a vote in the first place. They should vote in support of this motion and I hope they do the right thing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I rise today to speak to the MPI that we have just agreed to in relation to the Abbott government's set of broken promises. What we have seen from this government is broken promise after broken promise. These promises that have been broken go to the heart of the budgets of ordinary Australiansâ€”whether they are working Australians, whether they are pensioners, whether they are Australians who rely on benefits, or whether they are families with children. There is hardly a group in our community that the Abbott government's broken promises have not affected. The big end of town seems to be okay, but every other group in Australia has been really hit hard by these broken promises. They are very serious because, prior to the election, Mr Abbott gave absoluteâ€”what we thought were cast-iron guaranteedâ€”commitments that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to pensions, no rise in the GST, no cuts to the ABC and no cuts to SBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen quite the contrary on display from the government. Every single one of those allegedly cast-iron promises to the Australian public has now been absolutely broken, slashed and burned, cut up into little pieces and is now lying on the party room floor. It is an absolutely disrespectful way to treat Australians. I want to focus in particular on what the Australian public have to look forward to in the area of public health if Mr Abbott's government's cuts in that area make it through the parliament. What we have seen is an $80 billion cut to Australia's public hospitals and education. In relation to health we have seen the imposition of a GP tax, a tax on being sick, a tax on ordinary Australians when they visit their doctor. That will cost Australian families $3.5 billion a year in out-of-pocket expenses. For every single Australian, regardless of their incomeâ€”whether they are a pensioner, an average income earner or have got childrenâ€”that is the hit to their pocket. It is a hit on the most vulnerable in our community. People who should be supported by a safety net have seen that safety net ripped out from under them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also the government's plan to end Medicare. Right back as far as Malcolm Fraser the Liberals and the Nationals have not supported Medicare. Why? I have no idea. Australia's Medicare system is a proven system, it is a good system, it is valued by countries right around the world. But it seems that this government and successive Liberal-National governments want to slash and burn Medicare. As a young parent, as a low-income earner, I absolutely struggled when I was forced to take out health insurance under the Fraser government. What that meant was that I took my children to emergency departments and went without appropriate Medicare for myself because of cost. We should never impose that on Australians. We have had that strategy before. We have seen that it does not work. It is a failed strategy. The GP tax will say that the government decides who does visit a doctor and who does not. That is not right. I have lived through those days and I would not want to put that on anyone else. It is an unfair process. Our Medicare system should be available to every person in the community regardless of personal circumstances. It is not for governments to come between a medical practitioner and their patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is more, there is no evidence in Australia that GP services are being overused by patientsâ€”none whatsoever. In fact, we do want people who are vulnerable or have got persistent health problems to be visiting their GP. GPs are at the front line of our health services. They are the gatekeepers of our health services. But the Abbott government's broken promises do not stop there. We know that if you get a referral for an X-ray or to a physio there is likely to be a tax on that. If you get a prescription for pharmaceuticals there will be an additional tax on that. Out-of-pocket expenses for ordinary everyday Australians will just go on and on and on. We will see Australians lining up at emergency departments just as I did when I had young children. We will see pensioners going without the medical services they need because they will be too scared of the cost. This is extremely unfair. It is a complete broken promise. It is time the Abbott government admitted it and turned its back on this unfair tax.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  Bravo, Senator Lines, for making it through another repetitive effort from the great strategists opposite. They sit down every morning and say: 'What's the biggest thing on our agenda? What are we really passionate about raising on behalf of the Australian people?' We once again have this very predictable and extremely repetitive effort. Bravo, Senator Lines, for having another swing. To everybody from Labor who is going into bat today, well done! I hope we have not had to recycle too much! Unfortunately, from listening to that, they have no idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Johnson today in question time had it right. It is a very predictable MPI because there is no idea on the other side. We have blank space, blank heads, a blank page. It is a classic Labor tactic. It is not about broken promises; it is like a broken record. And the thing with a broken record is that people stop listening to it; they just turn it off; it becomes white noise in the back of everybody's day; nobody is listening. With your own reputation in tatters after six years of broken promises and incompetence, you are trying to tar us with your own brush. Labor is saying: 'We know we were dishonest, we know we were useless, but Tony Abbott and his mob are just as bad.' But the problem is that that claim is absolutely false. It is a classic tactic of Labor to go out with a media release, press conferences, statements in the chamber and questions through an inquiry that actually do not match the facts. In fact the shadow minister for employment released press releases during estimates which completely falsely represented what was happening in the estimates hearing at that particular time. It is a tired old tactic. The Australian people can obviously see through it. Despite your denials about the election results, there is no denying that they were emphatic about getting rid of the rhetoric and false claims of Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about broken promises. Labor promised to consult on climate change and instead delivered a carbon tax. Labor imposed the world's biggest carbon taxâ€”a $9 billion a year hit to our economy costing average households over $550 per year. Despite the emphatic result of the election over a year ago, Labor still supports a carbon tax. Labor senators voted to the keep the carbon tax in place last July, although they do not talk about that back in their electorates. They are in denial about the election resultâ€”a broken record long after the audience has left the dance floor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor promised a budget surplusâ€”in fact, they did not just promise it once; they promised it 500 timesâ€”but Labor have not delivered a budget surplus in over a quarter of a century. In fact, Wyatt Roy, the member for Longman, was not even born when Labor last delivered a budget surplus. Labor promised less debt; Labor government debt blew out to over $320 billion and was projected to reach $667 billion in 10 years. Labor promised more jobs; under Labor, the number of unemployed increased by over 200,000, productivity declined by 0.7 per cent a year, working days lost to strikes doubled and business red tape increased, making it a bit hard to deliver on that promise by Labor of more jobs. Another promise by Labor was to cut company tax; after the election, Labor scrapped the tax cut. Labor promised to give $2.1 billion for a transport link in Western Sydney; it never happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor promised to build an NBN. It would have cost at least $29 billion more than we were told, and hardly anyone signed up. The government is getting the NBN back on track with more than twice as many homes and businesses now receiving NBN services than a year ago. Under a coalition government, NBN Co met its rollout target for the very first time. That is good management. Labor promised to build 2,650 trades training centres in schools; 2.409 of them have not been built. Labor promised safe and secure borders; over 50,000 illegal arrivals came in more than 800 boats, causing a cost blow-out of over $11 billion. Labor promised to support the Australian Defence Force, and the Defence Force budget fell to the lowest level as a percentage of GDP since 1938.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This MPI goes to education, health, pensions, the GST, and the ABC and SBS. So let us look at the reality versus the string of Labor lies. In relation to education and schools under this government, Commonwealth spending for schools will reach record highs and increase over four years. That is the reality. It is black and white in the budget papers. In the recent budget, the Australian government kept its commitments and is investing record recurrent funding of $64.5 million in government and non-government schools over the next four years. That is an increase of $4.6 billion, or 37 per cent, during this period. They are the facts. There will be no cuts to education funding for schools. I quote ABC Fact Check:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government did not cut $30 billion from schools in the May budget â€¦ Ms Ellis is spouting rubbery figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is black and white, and it is simple: we did not cut funding to education. No matter how many times you say that we did, no matter how many MPIs you bring before the Senate, and no matter how many times you trot shadow ministers and backbench senators out for press releases and media releases, it does not make it true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is only one component of the Education portfolio; let us turn to universities. Labor's campaign on university reform is perhaps the most dishonest yet and I am sure that we are going to have a right royal stoush over the coming weeks about the reality versus Labor lies on that particular campaign. Let us look at Labor's record and at Senator Carr's record. Senator Carr's record on universities is that he proposed cuts to higher education and research of over $6.6 billion, which the department confirmed at a Senate inquiry last week, including $28 billion on one day in April 2013. Labor's current scare campaign on $100,000 degrees is plain wrong. The University of Western Australia has set fees for 2016 which are less than half of what Labor is claiming. No student will need to pay up-front, nor will they be prevented from attending universities for financial reasons. What we do know about the proposed reforms under the government's higher education legislation is that there will be a range of fees charged. To say there will be $100,000 degrees is simply wrong. We are increasing funding to universities, as was confirmed in the Senate inquiry last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story in the Health portfolio is very similar. Again, Labor is spouting rubbery figures. I know that those opposite do not like to hear this, but the budget papers show that the Abbott government is increasing funding to hospitals by $5.3 billion, or 40 per cent, over the next four years. That is the reality; that is the fact. Labor's trickery is that it promised increases beyond the forward estimates which it knew it could never afford, but Labor did not have to worry about that because the promises do not appear in the budget papers. What is in the budget papers, what is projected over the forward estimates and what the government proposes to spend over a given period of time is what we can argue about, because it is the reality; it is not dream time. This is known as Labor's budget time bomb.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The MPI goes to cuts to pensions. For the record, there are no cuts to pensions under this government. Pensions will continue to increase twice a year and the family home will continue to be exempt from the pension's asset test. Older Australians now have lower bills following the abolition of the carbon tax but still get to keep their energy supplement. The income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors health card were indexed from 20 September 2014, enabling up to 27,000 additional people to qualify for the card. I could go on in relation to this government's arguments around no cuts to pensions, no cuts to health and no cuts to education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor's claims are about $100,000 degrees are the most dishonest, then Labor's claims about the government's alleged secret plans to raise the GST are the silliest. We said that we would not be making any changes to the GST, and we are not. Again, just because you say that it is so does not make it so. The Australian people are interested in fact, not fiction, as demonstrated by their absolute support of the coalition's agenda at the last election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have key achievements. When we look at the promises that we took to the federal election, by any measure, the Abbott government is delivering on its promises. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  This motion goes to the issue of broken promises, but what it really goes to the issue of trust and integrity. What we seen from this government is an enormous breach of trust. It is an enormous breach of trust because the changes to these commitments that were made during the election campaign and that are now no longer relevant are so significant, so severe and so blatant that there is no hiding from it. Sometimes in politics we find these areas of grey. We see one side saying one thing, another side saying another and the truth is somewhere in the middle. But on this issue there is simply no excuse for what has occurred. There have been a string of broken promises and there has been a breach of trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that campaigned on the issue of trust and was relentless in its prosecution of the lies told about the carbon taxâ€”to use their words. This is a government that promised in opposition that it would be open, honest and accountable andâ€”to use the Prime Minister's wordsâ€”that they would do what they say and say what they do. How is it that they could effectively reverse position on so many issues of fundamental importance to the Australian community? The answer is straightforward. The changes announced by this government in this budget are so unpopular, they are so brutal and they are so necessary that, had they promised these things in the election campaign, people would never of bought it. The government would not have been voted into office. They simply did not have the courage to put this narrow, brutal and ideological world view to the Australian community. They did not have the courage to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They did not have the courage in education to stand up and say, 'We are going to make it harder for a young kid to get a university education.' They did not have the courage to say, 'If you are unemployed, we are going to kick you off welfare for six months. If you cannot cope, well, that's tough.' They did not have the courage in health care to say to people, 'You know what, we're going to make it harder for you to see a doctor. You might be struggling, but we are going to put a whopping great co-payment for when you go and see the GP; but we are going to add another co-payment on top of the existing co-payment for your medicines. We are going to make it harder for you to go and get a x-ray done because there will be costs associated with that as well.' They did not have the courage to put those issues to the Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are based on a lie. In health care, we are told that the health system is unsustainable, that it is out of control and that we have got some sort of emergency or crisis. Let me tell you what a crisis looks like: over the last decade, Commonwealth spending on health care has been stable. It has not changed. If anything, it has decreased. We saw the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report announced a month or two ago for the year 2012-13. There was the lowest growth since 1990 and 1991. I will say that again: we have seen the lowest growth in health spending for over two decades. When it comes to the amount we spent on health care, we are somewhere near the bottom of other OECD countries and half what the US spends on health care. That is what a crisis looks like and that is what unsustainable health spending looks like this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is totally confected and their solution is: 'We are going to whack in a great big co-payment, making it harder for people to see a doctor and particularly for those people who can afford it least.' But just as importantly, there are massive cuts to the way our hospital systems are funded. Over the next decade, we are going to see $50 billion taken out of our hospital system. Anyone who thinks that somehow that is a way of improving the health of the Australian community needs their head read. We have got a situation now where people already struggling through the public hospital system to be seen in a timely way in emergency departments. We have got long waiting lists for elective surgery and we have got people who are unable to get access to life-saving treatment. This government's response is to rip out $50 billion from the Australian hospital system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you combine the cuts to education, New South Wales stands to lose $25 billion over the next 10 years when you include those cuts to hospitals and education. In Victoria, over the next three years and this is when we take out that huge figure, we are looking at almost $400 million. This is a great breach of trust to the Australian community and the government did not have the courage to put it to the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I too rise to contribute to the matter of public importance on the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to the pension, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. As we know, Mr Abbott went to the election promising all these things and telling the Australian people that he would not change the pension, there would be no change the GST, there would be no cuts to education and there would be no cuts to health. He told them these things because he wanted to get elected. He wanted the Australian people to trust him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It did not take long for the trust that the Australian people put in Mr Abbott to be shown to unfortunately be misplaced. What we have seen from this government is a systematic targeting of those that can least afford to be targeted and those with the least amount of money. What we have seen is a substantial cut to pensions. In my home state of Tasmania, where we have around about 98,000 pensioners, they will be worse off and they know they will. The letter that Mr Abbott spent over $1 million on was to tell people that his election commitment was not based on a lie, but they know the truth and they know that they will be worse off. They have seen the work and they have seen some of the modelling produced by ACOSS. They know that they will be worse off. They know the Prime Minister has broken this commitment to them, and they will not forget it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Abbott, it appears, will unfortunately say anything to get into government. He has a list of lies and broken promisesâ€”and the list of lies unfortunately gets longer by the day. The massive cuts that he wants to inflict on Australians target pensioners, families, students, the poor and the sick. They give little hope for the future and take away so much from Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will continue to fight against these cuts and continue to speak up for those whose voices are not heard by this government. The effects of Mr Abbott's twisted priorities are worrying. They are frightening Australians, particularly, as I have mentioned, in my home state of Tasmania. The cuts to education will be extremely harsh for Tasmania. A good education can lift people out of poverty and give them hope and optimism for the future. We need to lift our students' performance. If Tasmanian students are to achieve in line with national standards Mr Abbott needs to keep his promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His first budget failed to fund the vital fifth and sixth years of the Gonski reforms and instead ripped $80 billion from our schools and hospitals. Tasmanian schools will lose $682 millionâ€”the biggest ever cut to our schools. But where are the Tasmanian Liberal senators, and where are the federal Liberal members in the House of Representatives when it comes to these cuts? They remain silent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Tasmanian school will suffer. Their funding will be cut although parents, teachers and students were promised improvements by Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne. These are savage cuts. They will leave the average school $3.2 million worse off and rob every student of $1,000 in individual support per year. The quality of education for Tasmanians will suffer. Parents, teachers and students have been betrayed. How can we expect Tasmanian students to improve their results when Mr Abbott is cutting funding for the resources and staff they need to help them? These cuts are the equivalent of sacking one in seven teachers, and they are already having a great impact in our classrooms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I come to the cuts to health. We know that Tasmania has a higher burden of chronic disease. Mr Abbott's $1.1 billion in cuts to public hospitals in Tasmania will seriously affect health outcomes for Tasmania. I am running out of time, but Tasmanians know that Mr Abbott came to this electionâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I feel the need to defend my Tasmanian colleagues in the face of that outburst, which suggested that Tasmanian senators and members of the lower house have not been out there talking up the important aspects of the federal budget and the federal policy positions that are now being implemented, which were promised at the federal election in 2013. I have heard, many times in this place, senators from Tasmania and the three members who represent Tasmanian electorates in the lower house out there talking up the importance of Tasmania. They support their home state. I would just like to put it on the record that unless Senator Brown has a hearing problem she should listen a little harder to her colleagues from Tasmania, even if they are from the other side of the chamber, when they support their home state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go to the substance of what I would like to say today in relation to the matter of public importance on the Prime Minister's election commitments, I would like to draw the attention of the house to the extraordinary scaremongering that continues to go on. The ABC has a fact check; maybe we need a fact check in this place, because some of the things that were said while I sat here and listened to the contribution of those opposite astounded me. They are actually incorrect. It is not just that they have not heard; they actually made statements that were factually incorrect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those statements, and the scaremongering that is going on, is creating a very negative and uncertain environment out there amongst voters. That is really not fair. If there are hard messages to sell, let's be honest about them and tell the voters the truth; do not beat it up with a whole heap of scaremongering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to draw an interesting comparison between the federal coalition government and a current Labor government that is in existence in this countryâ€”the state Labor government in South Australia. Labor has been in power in South Australia for the last 12 years. In that time we have seen South Australia become somewhat of a laughing stock for the rest of the country because the environment in that state does not encourage business. It does not support business growth. It is the highest taxed state and it is the state with the highest debt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really quite interesting to draw a parallel between the state government and what is happening federallyâ€”the positive things we are trying to put in place, despite the resistance and blocking that we see in the Senate. We have been trying to get some of the initiatives that we took to the election campaign through this place, but we are blocked, despite the people of Australia having voted for this government on exactly those mandates. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I draw to the house's attention the fact that the South Australian Labor government is a classic example of what happens when you do extraordinary things with budgets. That is exactly what we inherited when we came into government in 2013. Currently in South Australia the 2012-13 budget deficit is $940 million. That is the highest on record. When you consider the population in South Australia, on a pro rata basis it is an extraordinary amount of money that is owed by every man, woman and child in South Australia to pay for the budget deficit in that state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government of South Australia has delivered budget deficits for the past four years. Over the past year, the projected deficit has blown out to $1.2 billionâ€”the largest budget deficit in over 15 years. But the really annoying, dishonest and unscrupulous thing that is going on at the moment is that the Weatherill Labor government in South Australia is trying to con the South Australian public into thinking that this is all the federal government's fault. I just have to put on the record that the $14 billion debt bill that was projected by the Weatherill government out to 2016 was on the books well before we were elected to government in 2013. So it seems a little bit rich that we have a situation at the moment where the Weatherill government is spending millions of dollars of South Australia's taxpayers' moneyâ€”it is actually not South Australian taxpayers' money because they probably had to borrow it, like they borrow everything else to spend in South Australiaâ€”to fund a campaign to blame the federal government for something that, if you look at their budget figures, they acknowledged was already in existence well before the Abbott government was elected to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse than the budget deficit in South Australia are the election promises that the South Australian government made to the South Australian public about the creation of 100,000 jobs. In the time that they have been in government and with the creation of their 100,000 jobs policy, we have seen 8,700 more jobs, not 100,000. We need to be very careful that we get the facts on the table. As those opposite have mentioned in relation to particularly education and health, Mr Weatherill is trying to make the suggestion that the federal government are cutting health and education. As we well knowâ€”and as you would well know, Madame Acting Deputy President Lines, as you sat on the education hearings in relation to higher education and you sit on the Education and Employment Legislation Committeeâ€”education funding has not been cut. I repeat: education funding has not been cut. So, for Mr Weatherill to somehow blame the federal government for cuts in funding that are going to South Australiaâ€”when in fact the amount of money that is going to South Australia, not just for education but also for health, is increasingâ€”makes his lie and deceit even worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the South Australian government have created their own debt and deficit problem. The blame lies firmly with their policies and the implementation of their policies. It seems extraordinarily rich that Mr Weatherill would suggest to blame us and then spend additional money in creating a false campaign. You do not have to entirely take my word for thisâ€”</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Payne. She was going to take my word for it. This morning in the paper a letter was revealed from the Essential Services Commission in South Australia, ESCOSA, which is the independent economic regulator in South Australia. The chief executive of this regulator, Dr Paul Kerin, who had been appointed by the previous Labor government to this position, resigned the week following the South Australian election. In his letter, Mr Kerin states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have voted Labor most of my life and I chose to join the Commission under a Labor government â€¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, having seen that government from the inside, I have no appetite to deal with it for another four years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the reforms and his oversight of particular agencies in South Australiaâ€”undergoing the water industry's economic reform, the commission's role in driving that reform, the independence of government, government legislation et ceteraâ€”Mr Kerin went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My experience over the past three years has shown that the understanding in relation to those economic activities was incorrect. Instead, the government and its senior bureaucrats have clearly demonstrated that they have no interest in genuine reform, nor in serving the long-term interests of consumers. Indeed, they have stymied all efforts on those fronts at every turn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, he said he had been 'appalled by the behaviours that both ministers and senior bureaucrats had engaged in to stymie' those reform efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would have to suggest that, if you were going to appoint somebody to be an economic regulator and you are completely convinced of the goodness and wellbeing that you are providing to your state and the economic development you are providing to your state by your policies, you would certainly think that you would give your economic regulator every opportunity to be able to better those policies, keep an eye on them and make sure that they really were delivering the things that you were saying. The comments made by Dr Kerin were revealed only after a freedom of information request, because the bureaucrats within the department refused to release the letter of resignation from Dr Kerin, citing that it was contrary to the public interest. I thought that was quite an interesting reason for not releasing the fact that somebody was being critical of the operation of the government. You would think that the South Australian government would have wanted a level of transparency around its economic regulator because, surely, if everything they are saying about the economic prosperity and all the great things that they are doing in South Australia are true, they would want the independent verification of their independent regulator. That is a very sad indictment of one of Australia's Labor governments. The federal government may be an indication of what the Liberal Party in South Australia is likely to inherit if and when they should win government in South Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In standing here today and talking on this matter of public interest, I would like to put on the record that I think it is abhorrent that we are conducting scaremongering without any real facts around the information that we are putting into the public domain. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I do not normally speak to MPIs because they can, as some senators have observed, be fairly predictable. I could not let this one go past. It is premised on the rather now famous quotation, and I thank our colleagues in the Labor Party for bringing it forwardâ€”the PM's election promise, right on the eve of the last federal election, and it could not have been clearer: 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.' It is a measure of the despair with which many people hold politicians, that you would get a comment as bold-faced and as black and white as that, and it is immediately doubled back on at the earliest opportunity. That is the nature of someone who lied his way into office. There is no way of being more polite about it than that. It is as though the Prime Minister exists in his own eternal political present, where words just come out of his mouth to suit a particular moment or a particular sound grab, and the next day it is as though it was never said and we are all meant to just forget that it ever happened. The GST was the last piece of that puzzle until fairly recently, and, of course, that has been put into the public domain as well. The catalogue of deliberate deceptions that the GST has set running is now complete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything, as far as this government's budget repair proposals are concerned, is on the table except that which might offend powerful donors or interests. That has been very safely quarantined away as you have been marching around the landscape abolishing taxes for the last 12 months. Some economic interestsâ€”many of them very used to exercising their political cloutâ€”are coming in a hard-line and strategic way after our national broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS. It is that element of this trashed promise to the Australian public before the election that I want to focus on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts of somewhere between $120 million and $200 million to our national broadcaster, the ABC, are described by the minister as a 'down payment'. It is quite creepy behaviour when you think about itâ€”'That's a nice national broadcaster you've got there; it would be a shame if anything were to happen to it.' There are threats to editorial independence, threats to funding and now direct threats to programming. Maybe the ABC will be forced to take advertising. Maybe it will be forced to curtail its online presence. You can see why some of the ideologues who are coming after the ABC and SBS are so terrified of how well our national broadcasters are performing online. They are doing some of the most innovative stuff, I would say, not just in the country but in the world in taking a publicly funded national broadcaster and putting that presence online in a way that enlarges its audience to a new generation of people who are not necessarily watching mainstream free-to-air TV or, for that matter, reading newspapers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have come to realise that the ABC and SBS are not being attacked because they are failing; they are being attacked because they are succeeding a little too well. That is something that is really worth considering. These broadcasters are loved. They are national institutions that are loved by people right across the political spectrum and right across this continentâ€”from downtown in the big cities all the way out to the most remote and regional areas where you can get an ABC radio broadcast. That is one of the elements of why this government is in such trouble. The government was asked about the prospect of whether this could lead to job losses and, at this stage, we are looking at 500 or 600 job cuts. It may be less than that or it may be more. We do not know the scale of the cuts that are proposed. Mr Turnbull has said, 'It would depend on which staff are cut. The ABC is not a workers' collective.' What contempt! As though anybody proposed that it was a workers' collective; it is a much loved national broadcaster. That is why we have already seen the beginning of the damage being done: 80 staff have been let go from ABC International, the Australian Network has been trashed, the payments from DFAT to wind up its operations fell short by $5 million and the broadcaster is facing serious and significant cuts. That is why we will fight it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we put the government on notice, do not be surprised if the tiny handful of ideologues who loathe the very existence of public broadcasters come to heel when they need it. Do not be too surprised if that tiny handful of people are completely overmatched by the breadth and depth of passion with which Australian people from right across the country and right across the political spectrum will stand up and fight for their national broadcasters, both the ABC and the SBS. You are put on notice now. The Prime Minister may have forgotten that commitment that he made to the rest of the country right before the election, but we have not.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the Prime Minister's comments yesterday regarding the GST, surely we are now seeing the full set of broken promises completed. This government will soon be running out of promises to break, having systematically smashed every commitment it gave to the electorate. Proper reform means bringing the community with you, challenging vested interests and making a case for changing the status quo; proper reform means not doing a dump and run with this budget of broken promises; and proper reform means not just bumping up the nearest regressive tax that you can get your hands on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard today from both Senator Ruston and Senator McKenzie that what the Labor Party is saying in this regard is somewhat factually lackingâ€”that is how I would categorise what they saidâ€”but let us look at what this government is saying about taxation. That we have a government now looking earnestly at a regressive tax which affects the poor is a great concern to us. One of the great mythologies that exists out there is that Labor is always responsible for a higher level of taxation than the coalition. When we look at the ABC Fact Check, we find that, under the Labor period of government from 2007 to 2013, the average proportion of taxation as a proportion of GDP was 21.4 per cent, whereas in the previous Howard government there was a tax take of 23.5 per cent as a proportion of GDP. So, when we are talking about mythology, let us get our facts right and let us look at who is really responsible for higher taxes in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To return to the broken promises, I quote again: 'There will be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no changes to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.' All of these promises were made in one sentence that Mr Abbott uttered in an interview on SBS on the eve of the 2013 election. It was during a live interview when the then opposition leader was at one of the sports stadiums.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that his promises have been completely smashed. On education, what has essentially happened is that they have scrapped the fifth and sixth year of funding that was previously part of the bipartisan Gonski reforms. In the area of health, $50 billion has been cut from public hospitals, and in the area of pensions, the pension age has been raised to 70, with indexation slashed and concessions cut. In respect of the GST, comments were made yesterday about wanting to broaden and raise the tax. On the issue of no cuts to the ABC, we have seen that there will be $35 million in cuts over four years. And in respect of SBS, the carrier that broadcast the opposition leader's promises, there will be $8 million in cuts over four years. These cuts will hit Queensland hard. In Australia's most decentralised state, those regions of Queensland outside the capital will be hit especially hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we have also seen government senators justifying cuts to rural and regional health care on the basis that what they said before the election were merely National Party commitments and not coalition commitments. I asked Senator Nash, in her capacity of representing the Minister for Health, on 3 September about the fact that the Nationals election platform talked about increased financial support for doctors in regional and remote areas but that what actually came out in the budget was that the rebate for most GP and out-of-hospital pathology and diagnostic imaging services were to be reduced by $5. Senator Nash's response to that question was that if those opposite paid a little more attention they would realise that it is National Party policy and that they would go on to form coalition policy for the election campaign, and that immediately addresses the issue. That was the response from the National Party, the party that is supposed to be standing up for regional Australia and regional Queensland. They are nowhere to be found.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of these broken promises we have plans for $100,000 degrees as a further kick in the guts for regional Queenslanders. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Queensland Times</span>, a newspaper based in Ipswich, reported:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Universities in regional Queensland and New South Wales fear the Abbott Government's education reforms could hit hard, with the poor discouraged by new charges and the bright poached by whatever school has the most money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local councils have also been asked to get by on less grant money from the federal government, and do not even get me started on what Queenslanders think about this out-of-touch Treasurer's view that poor people do not drive cars. Despite the Senate comprehensively rejecting a new fuel tax, they have snuck it in the back door: an increased tax for Queenslanders every time they fill up at the bowser, thanks to this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia remains gobsmacked at the conduct and deceitfulness of this government and their astonishing record to date. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  This MPI is not a story of cuts; it is a story of Labor's record on debt, tax and deficits. It is a horrible history of Labor mismanagement and horrid economic planning. So, mums and dads watching at home, send your children out of the room now, because you are about to hear some figures and I do not want you swearing in front of your children, and neither do I want your children realising the full extent of the debt they are going to inherit from Labor and what that means in terms of the work they are going to have to do to pay off Labor's debt. I do not want the toddlers and teenagers of Australia having nightmares because of Labor's debt and all the work they are going to have to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, let us have a discussion about the figuresâ€”the truth about the inheritance Labor gave to us in September last year, when they were finally booted out of office. Labor initially forecast a surplus of $5.4 billion for the 2013-14 financial year and kept this forecast surplus for eight successive budget updates. The final figure was $48.5 billion in deficit. From 2008-09 to 2013-14, Labor delivered six successive deficits, totalling $240 billion, and we have many more to come, because of their mismanagement. If we include 2013-14, Labor left the government with future deficits of $123 billion up to the forward estimates for 30 June 2017. If no policy action was taken by Tony Abbott and the coalition to repair the budget position that the government inherited from Laborâ€”and the Greens; I will give them a mention here tooâ€”gross debt would have spiralled to $667 billion over the medium term and would have continued to grow. That is the equivalent of $25,000 for every Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Labor's legacy of debt for all Australians. But Labor do not want to talk about this. They do not want to talk about their six years in power. It is almost like the forgotten history of Australia in terms of the textbooks that Labor want to write. It costs $1 billion a month to pay the interest on Labor's record debt. This will be $2.8 billion a month in 10 years if nothing changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent budget office stated that 'without action Australia's debt will grow at one of the fastest rates in the developed world'. We have to make savings. If we do not make savings, this country will be in real trouble. So we want to make savings that should see us save money that could construct 15 new teaching hospitals every yearâ€”savings of $16 billion over 10 years. That is more than the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and higher education spending.</span>

                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  " />On the eve of the 2013-14 federal election, then Treasurer Chris Bowen had to go even further in his 2013 economic statement by writing down receipts a further $7.8 billion for 2013-14 and over $33 billion across the then forward estimates. This governmentâ€”Tony Abbott's government, Joe Hockey's government, Julie Bishop's government, Warren Truss's governmentâ€”inherited a shambles of a budget, a weakening economy and rising unemployment. This government had to take immediate action to address a number of unresolved issues inherited from Labor. This includes injecting $8.8 billion to restore the Reserve Bank of Australia's capital buffer after Labor ripped out $5.2 billion in dividends; providing $571 million in 2013-14 and $2 billion over the forward estimates to fix Labor's funding shortfall for offshore processing of illegal maritime arrivals; funding Public Service agencies to meet the cost of Labor's unfunded redundancies arising from their hidden job cuts; and clearing 96 announced but unlegislated tax and superannuation measures that included measures announced to boost the budget bottom line, even though these measures could never be delivered or would damage the economy. <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Labor left Australia with no plan to fund the future and address their unsustainable spending trajectory over the medium term.</span></span>

He said on SBS in an interview in September 2013 that there would be, and I quote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have heard this repetitively during this debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the election, we have seen a very different story emerge as the Abbott government has systematically set out to break each and every one of these commitments. The ABC and SBS have had their budgets cut. The government is planning a devastating $80 billion worth of cuts to health and education. They are trying to slash pensions by $80 a week over the next 10 years and make all Australians work until they are 70 before they can qualify for the pension. And now the Abbott government is heading for a 100 per cent perfectly shameful record of broken promises, as they turn their sights to breaking their pre-election promise not to change or increase the GST.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the GST is distributed on a needs basis. It takes into account each state's ability to raise revenue and balances it with each state's funding needs to determine the fairest way to distribute the funds. A fundamental principle of the GST is that all states must have the revenue they need to provide their citizens with basic services like health, education, transport and security. No state should be left behind, and states that are benefiting from times of greater prosperity should contribute a bit more to help the states that are doing it a bit tougher. If the GST were changed, it would be devastating for Tasmania. Seven hundred million dollars in revenue and the vital public services that this money supports would be in peril. But it is not just Tasmania that could lose out if the rate base or distribution formula for the GST is changed. Let us not forget that it was not so long ago that Western Australia was a net beneficiary of the GST. And there is nothing to guarantee that that situation will not turn again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, Labor was very concerned that the Abbott government had its sights set on changing the GST. This was a reasonable concern, given the Western Australian Liberal Premier Colin Barnett let the cat out of the bag about Mr Abbott's talks with the Liberal premiers on plans to change the GST once he got into government. But, remarkably, as the 2013 election drew closer, the story from those opposite changed dramatically. With his eyes keenly on the prime ministerial prize, Mr Abbott set about hiding his plans, saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 May last year, he reinforced the message to Launceston's <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Examiner</span> newspaper, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition fully supports the existing GST arrangements. We will not change them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But now the Prime Minister must be getting giddy, because the past week has seen him perform another dramatic backflip. And this one shows that Labor's pre-election concerns about his plans for the GST were entirely justified. Gone are Mr Abbott's sincere promises about not meddling with the GST. Now, the Prime Minister is saying that the GST is certainly:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ something which ought to be looked at as part of the federation reform process and as part of the tax reform process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also talked of the need to look at spending responsibilities and revenue capacities while, at the same time, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It should be possible to make these arrangements more equitable between the larger states with the smaller states no worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This idea that more money can go to one state without disadvantaging any other states or increasing the amount of GST that is taken up is little more than 'magic pudding' economics. It does not add up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: the threat to Tasmanian public services of Tony Abbott and the Liberals making changes to the GST is very real. Now, more than ever, we need a strong response from the Tasmanian Liberals in this place. In Launceston's <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Examiner</span> this week, the Liberal member for Bass and the Liberal member for Lyons both voiced their support for the current system. But the member for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley, failed to provide a comment. The most fundamental duty of a member of parliament is to fight for the interests of the people that elected them. At a time when north-west Tasmanians need a strong representative in Canberra to fight these regressive GST changes, Mr Whiteley has gone missing in action. It is time that he came out of hiding and fought against a move that could strip the Tasmanian economy of $700 million a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, in a speech on 24 March this year, Mr Whiteley was quite willing to talk about the GST when he accused the Palmer United Party of:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ announcing a policy to rip hundreds of millions of dollars of GST payments out of the Tasmanian economy in a desperate attempt to win a seat at the upcoming Senate election in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went further, saying that Senator Lambie is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ faced with the challenge of standing up for the people of Tasmania or backing her party leader in ripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Tasmanian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now time for Mr Whiteley to step up and back his electorate against his party leader's plans that could rip hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Tasmanian economy. For Tasmania's sake, Mr Whiteley needs to demand that the Prime Minister keeps his pre-election promise not to make any changes to the GST.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' 14th report of the 44th Parliament. This report provides the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' view on the compatibility with human rights as defined in the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 of bills introduced during the period 30 September to 2 October 2014 and legislative instruments received during the period 13 to 19 September 2014. The committee has also considered responses to the committee's comments in previous reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 12 bills introduced in the period covered by the report, four are assessed as not raising significant human rights concerns and four raise matters requiring further correspondence with ministers. The committee has deferred its consideration of the remaining four bills. A number of the bills considered are scheduled for debate during the sitting week commencing 27 October 2014, including the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2014, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 6) Bill 2014, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Job Seeker Compliance Framework) Bill 2014 and the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2014, which senators will be pleased to know does not infringe upon anyone's human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, the report outlines the committee's examination of the compatibility of these bills with our human rights obligations, and I encourage my fellow senators and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation. Importantly, for the protection of traditional rights and freedomsâ€”some would prefer the term 'civil liberties'â€”this report includes our examination of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. As has been widely reported, this legislation proposes a range of very significant changes to national security laws in Australia, and, as a consequence, the limitation of fundamental rights and freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a context to my remarks, I remind senators that the committee's task is to undertake a technical and bipartisan inquiry into the human rights implications of legislationâ€”international human rights obligations as agreed by previous governments. Importantly, the scrutiny role of the committee requires that it conduct its assessments in the absence of partisan politics. Senators will already be familiar with the work of other parliamentary committeesâ€”the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Securityâ€”and the similar conclusions drawn by them and us on a variety of proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, I regard the committee's approach to examining the Foreign Fighters bill as seeking to create a constructive dialogue around the measures contained in the bill by highlighting particular issues of human rights concern to the parliament. In this respect, there is scope within the human rights legislative scrutiny framework to ensure that important issues of national security are balanced against the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report clearly states that the committee 'notes that human rights principles and norms are not to be understood as inherently opposed to national security objectives or outcomes' and that 'international human rights law allows for the balancing of human rights considerations with responses to national security concerns'. Critically, the committee expects proponents of legislation, who bear the onus of justifying proposed limitations on human rights, to apply this framework in the statement of compatibility required for bills More simply put, proposed measures can limit human rights, if they can be shown to be reasonable, necessary and proportionate in pursuit of a legitimate objective. This analytical framework is capable of ensuring that any intrusions into human rights are finely calibrated, such that our laws only limit rights as much as is necessary to achieve their goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, the report observes that, in relation to a number of the proposed measures, the statement of compatibility does not fully explain why the measures are necessary in pursuit of a legitimate objective. In particular, it does not explain how and why existing law enforcement and intelligence-gathering powers are insufficient to prevent serious threats to Australia's national security interests. In these instances, the committee is seeking further explanation from the Attorney-General's Department. For example, the bill would extend for 10 years a number of specific powers which are due to expire in 2015 or 2016, such as control orders and preventative detention orders. The committee's report notes that it regards there to be sufficient time before these powers expire to undertake detailed and thorough inquiries as to their efficacy and necessity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also taken the approach of recommending amendments and constructive solutions in relation to a number of the measures in order to strengthen the human rights compatibility of the bill. For example, the bill currently allows for the exclusion of foreign evidence that is obtained directly as a result of torture. The committee has suggested that foreign evidence obtained directly or indirectly from torture should be excluded in order to align the legislative proposal with Australia's international obligations under the convention against torture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would note that the committee has determined that some of the measures outlined in the bill are likely to be incompatible with human rightsâ€”for example, the introduction of the declared area offence provision. This provision would introduce a new offence of entering or remaining in a declared area unless it was solely for a legitimate purpose. The bill specifies a limited number of legitimate purposes. The offence is punishable by a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As noted in the report, the proposed construction of the offence would mean that a person could commit the offence without actually knowing that the area was declared and without any intention of engaging in or supporting terrorist activity. A person accused of entering or remaining in a declared area would bear an evidential</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Burdenâ€”that is, they would need to provide evidence that they were in a declared area solely for a legitimate purpose. An offence provision which requires the defendant to carry an evidential burden will engage the right to be presumed innocent because a defendant's failure to discharge the burden of proof may permit their conviction despite reasonable doubt as to their guilt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also raised concerns in relation to the right to freedom of movement as the list of defences or excuses to the proposed offence is relatively narrow. For example, it is not a defence to visit friends, transact business, retrieve personal property, attend to personal or financial affairs or to undertake a religious pilgrimage. While it is a defence to be 'making a news report,' this is only the case if the person is 'working in a professional capacity as a journalist'. Accordingly, there appear to be a number of innocent reasons why a person might enter or remain in a declared zone, but that would not bring a person within the scope of the sole legitimate purpose defence. The report therefore concludes that the declared area offence provision, as currently drafted, is likely to be incompatible with human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More significantly, though, the right to freedom of expression, also known as free speech, is a foundational principle of our democracy and is protected by article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The committee is of the view that a number of measures in the bill engage this fundamental human right or civil liberty. The ASIO special powers regime allows ASIO under a questioning and detention warrant to request the detention of a nonsuspect for the purpose of intelligence gathering. For two years after the expiry of a warrant, it is an offence for an individual to disclose operational information or information which is broadly related to the warrant. This restricts the ability of the media to report on the use of these warrants. The bill would extend the special warrant regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The control order regime may be applied because of things a person has said rather than things they have done. It also enables a person subject to a control order to be prohibited from talking to particular persons including the media. This bill extends this control order regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The preventative detention order regime may also be applied because of things a person has said rather than things a person has done. The bill would extend this regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extension of stop, question, search and seizure powers may be used to disrupt protest activities through the use of 'declared area' powers which would enable the police to stop, question and search people in the declared area without reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed any offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to advocating terrorism the bill proposes a new offence of advocating terrorism. The offence would be made out where a person:(a) advocates the doing of a terrorist act or a terrorism offence; and (b) is reckless as to whether another person will engage in that conduct as a result. The offence would be punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment. The report notes the committee's concern that the offence, as drafted, may result in the criminalisation of speech and expression that does not advocate the commission of a terrorist act or terrorism offence. This is because the proposed offence would require only that a person is 'reckless' as to whether their words will cause another person to engage in terrorism (rather than the person 'intends' that this be the case).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not the ambition of this committee to be inconvenient to the desire and duty of governments to protect citizens from the harm of others and the deliberate evils of terrorism. But the scrutiny role of this committee in the Senate must always be to shine a light on real and possible breaches of those fundamental rights and libertiesâ€”the right to freedom from arbitrary detention, the right to freedom of movement, the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence, the right to privacy and the rights to freedom of expression and association. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Sub-Committee heard from Defence officials at a public hearing held on the 6th of June. It also received evidence from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and two industry participants, ClinetiQ and Nova Systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of its review, the Sub-Committee considered Defence estate issues, including the cost pressures associated with the maintenance of heritage listed buildings. The Committee recommends Government should review the process by which Defence properties are placed on the Commonwealth Heritage List and how their maintenance is funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Sub-Committee also considered the efficacy of Defence contracts to ensure that SMEs are paid in a timely manner by prime contractors. Based on evidence received, the Committee recommends that Government should review its contract templates and procurement processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Sub-Committee considered the scope of the Defence Cooperation Program and options for a Whole of Government approach to supporting regional partners. Noting the complexities of achieving a structured and coordinated regional security effect, the Committee commends Defence on the development of a future framework in the Pacific. However, Australia needs to ensure it is achieving value for money with the Defence Cooperation Program, and specifically, the Pacific Patrol Boats Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, during the course of the review, it became apparent that, despite some positive developments, Defence's approach to capability management remains fragmented. There does not appear to be a single contiguous system which Defence can use to conduct capability-assurance from definition, through acquisition and service-life, to disposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee believes that the introduction of such a system, potentially managed by the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, would increase transparency and enhance oversight by Government and the Parliament of capability management by Defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That being said, it was pleasing to see positive outcomes arising from the SEA 1000 industry Integrated Project Team - a working group made up of Defence and industry experts who are developing the design brief for the new submarines and examining potential industries able to execute such a project. The Committee encourages the further development of this initiative, along with transparent communication of the team's views to Government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee believes that expertise within the private sector could be leveraged for all stages of the capability development life cycle. Rather than contracting for specific packets of work, greater benefit could be gained by entering into a teaming arrangement as part of a whole-of-life approach to identifying and managing risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee is also concerned by the lack of detail in the Defence Annual Report on the progress of implementation of all the Coles review recommendations relating to the Collins Class submarines. This is something that needs to be expanded upon in future Defence annual reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr President, it is disappointing to note that the Committee is still awaiting a response from Defence to the recommendations of its previous Defence Annual Report review, which was tabled in June last year. The Committee hopes to receive a response to its previous review shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee acknowledges the dedication and commitment of the servicemen and women of the Australian Defence Force and commends them on the outstanding service they provide to the nation. The Committee also recognises that the members of the ADF are supported by an enduring network of families, friends and loved ones and to these people we give our thanks.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Committee notes the loss of Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey during 2014. Our deepest condolences and thoughts are extended to his family and friends.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair of the committee, Mr Ken Wyatt, and the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Shayne Neumann, spoke yesterday in the House of Representatives to outline and discuss the progress report. I too will emphasise what the report and progress is about. It should be noted that there has been a long journey and process leading up to the tabling of this progress report. It is another big step forward. We should realise that the real journey has only just begun.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The campaign to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution is an important one, not just for the first people but for all Australians. Ultimately, this is an opportunity for all Australians to celebrate, to unite and to add more than 40,000 years to our nation's history. It is about being inclusive, not exclusive, and it is something we should all get behind. This report clearly states that we must do all we can to ensure the campaign and message is clearly delivered to all Australians. It is imperative that we are all behind the journey towards constitutional recognition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only 47 years ago, less than a lifetime, back in 1967, the Australian government ran a referendum to change the Constitution to give Aboriginal people the right to vote. We can all take heart that this referendum was overwhelmingly endorsed by Australians, winning 90.77 per cent of votes and carrying in all six states. We need to rebuild that momentum from 1967. We need to inspire, engage with and reach out to all Australians on what we are trying to achieve. We need to right a wrong, and that will only be realised with the support of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report contains three options for recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. I am very pleased to say that all three options deal with issues of discrimination. This is a win for common sense. It is a win for all Australians, not just Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months ago when I tabled the interim report I stated in this house that I had grave concerns with the path to constitutional recognition when the government had plans to weaken the provisions to the Racial Discrimination Act. With those plans now scrapped, I believe the pathway towards achieving recognition is one step closer. This has been reinforced by three key recommendations of the report, which all recommend removing references to race.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Aboriginal woman, this constitutional change is incredibly important to me and to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I say to you that I will never tire in my pursuit to do all that I can to ensure that the voices of Aboriginal Australians are heard. We must now ensure that we put every effort into encouraging all Australians to be part of this process and to vote 'yes' for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my role as an Aboriginal member of this parliament, I am honoured to be in a position to advocate for recognition on behalf of all Aboriginal people and the Australian Labor Party. I reiterate that Australia does not lose 226 years of history; it gains 40,000 years of history.</span>

As a member of the committee I would like to commend the deputy chair for her work, and particularly the chair, as they have been quite diligent in consulting widely right around Australia, often on the committee's behalf. It has been fabulous. I would like to thank the co-members of our committee, who have been a real pleasure to work with. I hope the spirit in which all parties and senators and members have approached the very hard work of this particular committee and report, and in getting everybody's finger on the page, is symbolic of the greater task before all of us as we head out into our communities and beyond to engage, initiate, drive and facilitate the conversation in our community so that Australians are fully informed as they head towards a referendum.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that each House of Parliament set aside a full day of sittings to debate concurrently recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples as set out in this report with a view to achieving near-unanimous parliamentary support for and building momentum towards a referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is going to be a fascinating debateâ€”to have all Australian people, through the lower house, and all states, through the Senate, discussing and debating the options that our committee has set out for ways that we may achieve constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I rise to also take note of this progress report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. In rising I would also like to acknowledge and to again express what a pleasure it is to work with the committee in trying to progress this issue, because everybody is interested in achieving constitutional recognition. I would also like to thank the secretariat, who have again put in effort above and beyond the call of duty and have contributed very significantly to the progress report and to the outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the important issues we are dealing with in constitutional recognition is that generally most Australians are, in theory, supportive of the concept of constitutional recognition. RECOGNISE has been out there talking to people about constitutional recognition. But what the committee has found when we are out there talking to people is that they have been consulted by the expert panel, they have engaged with RECOGNISE and they have engaged with the joint parliamentary select committee, but there has been no forward progress in terms of what the consultation is about. The expert panel went out and asked them what they thought, they drafted up a report and a lot of people see that there has been little progress. I am not saying that in a negative way, but there has been little progress in determining what the question isâ€”what are we going to ask Australia to support in a referendum? Of course, I am coming from the perspective that I want them to give a great big tick to constitutional recognition, but, I have always said, in a substantive way. When the committee has gone out again to talk to people they have said, 'What's the proposition?' This committee report gives people a thing to grab hold of and talk about. What are the options that you favour? Option 1 is the one that is closest to the expert panel's recommendations, and it contains what I would suggest are the substantive bits of the expert panel recommendations without, very notably, the language provision, 127. Option 2 does not go as far as option 1, and option 3 is a significantly different proposition that, as Senator Peris articulated, still takes out the reference to race in section 51(xxvi).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must admit, without pre-empting the debate, that I am really joining Senator McKenzie in very strongly advocating the debate in both houses of parliament. I must say that, in terms of option 3, I would be really disappointed if we did not have those beautiful words in that the expert panel recommends, in terms of recognising that the continent and its islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, acknowledging the continuing relationship of those peoples with their traditional lands and waters and the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal peoples. I think these are really strong sentiments, and I would really like to see them in our Constitution. However, one of the key recommendations that the committee also makes in this report, and one that I think is really important, is that this placeâ€”both the House of Representatives and the Senateâ€”should talk about this in a really substantive way, and that we put aside time to do that. I think that what Australians are looking for is some leadership from their leaders in this place. If we cannot sit and talk about the options that are on the tableâ€”to sit down and have a substantive discussion about itâ€”how can we expect the rest of Australia to engage in what would be the question? So I very strongly support the recommendations here, and urge people to engage with recommendation 1.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the government, in a timely mannerâ€”and I am not saying they are not going toâ€”takes this on board and makes sure that we fit into our calendar this discussion around these options, because it will enable the members and senators to engage in this discussion. What it should also do is to provoke them, before that discussion happens, to go out and talk to their constituentsâ€”what do their constituents see for constitutional recognition? What would they like to see in the Constitution? I am also hoping it will engage them in the desire and support for constitutional recognition. So it will have that two-fold effect of engaging people and encouraging people to engage and support constitutional recognition. But, very importantly: what is the question that they want to see in a referendum?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other two recommendations are further articulating the proposition that the joint select committee made public comment about, which is that the referendum to change the Constitution should take place at or shortly after the next election in 2016. Recommendation 7, which I think is very important, is the recommendation that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Act 2013 should be extended to align with the timing of a referendum. It was the review panel that recommended to the government, not long ago, this year, that they need to pay attention to that act because it does sunset next year, and we would hate to see that act sunset before we got to a constitutional referendum. So again I hope that the government can take that on board and make sure that we do extend that act while we continue this community discussion around constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not pretending that constitutional recognition will suddenly fix and address the issues around the substantive disadvantage and the discrimination that Aboriginal peoples have faced over the period since occupation of Australia occurred. But I do see it as a very, very important step towards reconciliation and in continuing the addressing of the injustices that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have suffered since the occupation of Australia. As I said, it is not the answer, but it is a substantial step towards it. But we cannot afford to get it wrong. We cannot afford to go with a question that does not meet people's needs and, in particular, support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. But we cannot afford, certainly in my opinion and I know in the Greens' opinion, to get this wrong. We need to get it right. So we need to invest the time, which is why it is so important that this place does debate these issues and does debate these options to have a look at what this country could support. I commend the report to the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the members of the committee, in particular the chair, Mr Ken Wyatt, and Senator Peris, the deputy chair, who put so much effort into leading and making sure that we got this progress report done. I look forward to the contributions and the debates that we are going to have in this place in the very near future. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

The National Action Plan will cover a five year period and will include specific action items seeking to prevent and address the exploitation of vulnerable groups, such as migrant workers. The National Action Plan will also be accompanied by a revised Communications Awareness Strategy which will include specific materials for categories of visa holders considered vulnerable to exploitation.

POCA funding is not available on an ongoing basis and is generally provided for specific projects through competitive and transparent grants processes.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) the provision of activity based funding for specific activities. This type of funding generally includes a specific set of activities and the associated expected outcomes, as well as a defined activity budget to report and acquit against, and</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Due to the nature of this funding, it is normally not possible for DFAT to negotiate refinancing of these contracts. Core funding is provided by DFAT where it identifies a shared value and it promotes the government and program's aid agenda. Core funding supports notâ€‘forâ€‘profit organisations to undertake their work so no contract extensions are required. NGOs can also apply for grant funding from DFAT themselves for support of a specific activity; and they can also be invited to apply for grant funding in competitive grant processes DFAT runs. A defined activity grant/s with a set budget and timeframe will be the result of this process. For activity grant funding, the activity occurs over an agreed time frame, so extending the agreement one year before it ends would not normally be required. If any extensions are needed to complete activities they would be granted for minimal time to ensure outcomes are obtained, with appropriate approvals.</span>

The Extended Assessment Stream, which provides access to a further 45 days' intensive support, may be offered to victims who are willing, but unable, to assist police, due to reasons including ill health or trauma. Longer-term support for victims who are willing and able to assist police is available through the Justice Support Stream of the Support Program.</span>

A BVF is valid for up to 45 days and enables suspected victims without a valid visa to access the Assessment Stream of the Support Program. Suspected victims who are willing, but unable for such reasons as ill health or trauma, to assist police may be granted a BVF for an additional 45 days to enable access to the Extended Assessment Stream. The offer of a second BVF is considered on a caseâ€‘by-case basis. Victims on the Justice Support Stream may be granted a Criminal Justice Stay visa to allow them to remain in Australia for the duration of the criminal justice process. A Witness Protection (Trafficking) (Permanent) visa (WPTV) may be offered to allow a victim, and their immediate family members, to remain permanently in Australia if they have made a contribution to an investigation or prosecution and would be in danger if returned home.</span>

While the Australian Government does not intend to formally review the Visa Framework and the Support Program at this time, the Australian Government is committed to the continuous improvement of Australia's strategy to combat human trafficking and slavery. Following the passage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Act</span> on 27 February 2013, members of the Operational Working Group, which is comprised of the Australian Federal Police, the Attorney-General's Department (AGD), the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Social Services, and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP), agreed it would be appropriate to consider whether the Support Program and Visa Framework continue to be sufficiently flexible and responsive to meet the needs of victims.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government notes the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee's recommendation to consider establishing an ongoing visa and access to a victim support mechanism that is not conditional on a victim of human trafficking and slavery providing assistance in the criminal justice process. The Visa Framework and the Support Program are designed to ensure a balance between victim welfare and criminal justice processes. Prosecutions for human trafficking, slavery and slavery-like offences rely heavily on witness assistance and testimony, and the complete de-linking of witness assistance and visa provisions from the criminal justice framework may affect the success of human trafficking and slavery related prosecutions. The Visa Framework is designed to protect and support victims of human trafficking and slavery before, during and after the criminal justice process. Other support, migration and visa options may be available to victims of human trafficking and slavery who do not wish to provide assistance to authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government also notes the Committee's comment about the need to ensure that even if assistance does not lead to a conviction, it is still substantial in terms of giving assistance to authorities. Under the Visa Framework, a victim of human trafficking or slavery may be invited to apply for a Witness Protection (Trafficking) (Permanent) visa (WPTV) to allow them, and their immediate family members, to remain permanently in Australia if they have made a contribution to an investigation or prosecution and would be in danger if returned home. A WPTV can only be granted to a victim of human trafficking or slavery if the conditions specified in regulation 2.07AK of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Regulations 1994 </span>are met. One of the conditions is that the Attorney-General, or a person authorised by the Attorney-General, must have issued a Witness Protection (Trafficking) certificate (WPTC) to the effect that the victim has made a contribution to and cooperated closely with an investigation or prosecution into alleged human trafficking or slavery offences (whether or not a conviction is obtained). The Australian Federal Police must provide a detailed assessment of a victim's contribution to the Attorney-General's Department before a WPTC is issued. The role of the Attorney-General in this process ensures that the assessment of the victim's contribution is independent and impartial. The Australian Government also notes that applications for a WPTV may only be made after an invitation to do so from DIBP. These controls contribute to the integrity of the WPTV process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government further investigate the establishment of a federal compensation scheme for proven victims of slavery and people trafficking.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government notes that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children</span> states that each Party shall 'ensure that its domestic legal system contains measures that offer victims of trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered'. Under Australia's domestic legal system, compensation for victims of crime is generally a matter for States and Territories. Each State and Territory has a victims' compensation scheme, which may be available to victims of human trafficking and slavery. A number of victims have accessed compensation from these State and Territory schemes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">By contrast to the State and Territory victims' compensation schemes, a reparation order is made by a judicial officer when sentencing an offender.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has always maintained there is no place in society for child abuse material. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</span> sets in place clear legal mechanisms for the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to investigate and enforce the rapid takeâ€‘down of child abuse content hosted in Australia. The United Kingdom's Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) notes that the ACMA 'â€¦ operates under a highly-developed regulatory scheme that enables take-down of illegal content within very short timeframesâ€”with an impressive 100 per cent compliance from industry.'<span style="color:gray;">2</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, over 99 per cent of online child abuse content investigated by the ACMA is hosted outside Australia. The ACMA is unable to enforce the take-down of such content. This is why the ACMA is a member of the International Association of Internet Hotlines (INHOPE), which represents 44 internet hotlines globally, including the IWF. INHOPE acts as a 'fast lane' across international borders to support rapid law enforcement and Internet Service Provider (ISP) action in the host country. The ACMA is the member agency for Australia and administers an online reporting mechanism through which the publicâ€”and law enforcementâ€”can lodge complaints (www.acma.gov.au/hotline)<span style="color:gray;">www.acma.gov.au\hotline</span>. In this context, the ACMA has a longâ€‘established and highly effective relationship with the IWF and other INHOPE members, with regular exchanges of information taking place. For example, in February 2012, collaboration between the ACMA, the IWF, and the Queensland Police led to the arrest of a man in Molendinar, Queensland.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In an additional effort to tackle overseas-hosted child abuse content, the Government announced on 9 November 2012 that Australia's major ISPs will block content on the INTERPOL "Worst of" list under an arrangement with the AFP. The AFP is working with the ISP community to see wider implementation of this blocking. The INTERPOL list is a highly reputable, targeted list compiled with the assistance of law enforcement agencies globally and assessed by two independent INTERPOL member agencies. It operates by blocking content that it is a criminal offence in Australia to produce, access, possess or distribute, at a domain level and thereby captures all URLs made available through the identified domain. This is an effective method for ISPs to block illegal content, pursuant to Australian law, which is often hidden or moved within a domain to avoid detection. In April 2013 there were approximately 1200 domains on the INTERPOL list. This number will change significantly as domains are added or removed. By comparison, the IWF list typically holds between 500â€”800 URLs at any one time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A primary purpose of the INTERPOL list is crime prevention. INTERPOL, in conjunction with other relevant law enforcement agencies, investigates all content that is lodged on the list.

The impacts are significant, and the harms are felt throughout Australia. It is imperative that the strategy for combatting serious and organised crime is collaborative, robust and puts to use all powers available to government. The development of consistent national criminal intelligence capabilities, enabling improved intelligence sharing between agencies and across jurisdictions and ensuring access to timely, accurate and relevant intelligence about criminal groups and activities, are key components to improving the response to serious and organised crime.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Criminal Intelligence Model (ACIM) represents an important step forward in the development of a more effective and efficient national criminal intelligence landscape. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Forum (ACIF) brings together heads of intelligence and law enforcement agencies across all jurisdictions, including a representative from the national security community, CrimTrac and the Australian and New Zealand Policing Advisory Agency (ANZPAA) to oversight implementation of the ACIM framework and to provide the mechanisms to harness and share Australia's intelligence assets. The ACIM provides a framework to support a whole-of-enterprise approach to intelligence capability management.</span>

A key objective of the ACIM is to consider the technical and security architecture necessary for information and intelligence sharing. Awareness and compliance with data security management practices, standards, principles, protocols and safeguards are being considered as part of the development of an information management strategy. The ACIM aligns with the ANZPAA information sharing protocols and sets out the common principles that are to guide the sharing of criminal intelligence. Like the ACIM, the ANZPAA protocols instil governance procedures to ensure security requirements are maintained, understood and compliant with legislative obligations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Significant work has been done at the Commonwealth level in recent years to strengthen the practices, standards and safeguards that protect data and information. For example, significant reforms to the <span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>that commenced on 12 March 2014 introduced new Australian Privacy Principles that apply to the collection, use, disclosure, integrity, access and correction of personal information.

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), under the Department of Defence, provides advice and assistance on matters relating to security and the integrity of information. This involves a stocktake and review of the type of data being held, networks, detection mechanisms and protections in place. The ASD produces a number of guidance materials on information security<span style="color:gray;"></span>(http://www.asd.gov.au/publications/index.htm), including the Australian Government Information Security Manual which provides the framework for how government secures its data, including Commonwealth law enforcement data.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since becoming the Minister for Veteransâ€™ Affairs, and in the three years prior as the shadow minister, I made it clear that I was not prepared to see the mistakes of the past repeated when it came to the nationâ€™s treatment of its veterans, ex-service personnel and their families. The treatment of Vietnam veterans on their return remains a dark stain on this nationâ€™s history. It is something that must never be repeated. This philosophy underpins everything the government seeks to achieve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Proper and robust research will help us to plan for the future. The research studies released today give us an enhanced understanding of the long-term effects of military service from a range of wartime and peacekeeping missions on the health of veterans and their families, and their access to health services. These three studies represent a significant investment in the future health and wellbeing of veterans, peacekeepers and their families, with the government providing funding of around $12.25 million to support their completion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the election, the government committed itself to release of the Vietnam Veterans Family Study at the earliest opportunity. We also promised extensive consultation. Today, this report to government is released.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Vietnam Veteransâ€™ Family Study, with over 27,000 participants, is one of the most significant government-funded research projects commissioned about veterans and their families. I would like to first and foremost thank those veterans and their families who participated in the study, and acknowledge the hard work of the various researchers involved, including the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the Australian Institute of Family Studies and Colmar Brunton Social Research.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly acknowledge the Consultative Forum for the Study, made up of veterans, partners and children, which also made a significant investment of their time and expertise, for which I am very grateful. My thanks go to Professor Bryan Rodgers, Chair of the studyâ€™s scientific advisory committee, and its members who ensured the rigour and validity of this large study.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The study compared the physical, mental and social wellbeing of two groups of Australian veterans: 10,000 randomly selected Army Vietnam veterans and their families, with 10,000 randomly selected Defence personnel who served in the Army during the Vietnam War era but did not deploy to Vietnam, along with their families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The research findings indicate that although the majority of sons and daughters of Vietnam veterans are leading healthy and productive lives, the family members of deployed Vietnam veterans were more likely to have emotional, physical and social problems than other comparable military families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />The peacekeeper's health study focuses on seven peacekeeping missions from 1989 to 2002: Namibia, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Rwanda, Somalia and the two East Timor deployments. More than 14,000 Australian personnel were deployed as part of these operations. The vast majority participated in the East Timor operations, with over 10,000 personnel deployed between 1999 and 2002. A random sample of over 2,000 peacekeepers were invited to participate, with more than 1,000 contributing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final study released today is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Rwanda Deployment Health Study</span>. This study, conducted by the then Centre for Military and Veteransâ€™ Health, investigated the health outcomes of the 680 veterans from Operation TAMAR in Rwanda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The studies released today have relied on the firsthand, quantitative evidence provided by veterans and their families. Their contributions, frank answers to questions and willingness to participate have provided the evidence for the findings contained.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The governmentâ€™s investment in research does not end with the release of these studies. In July this year, I launched the Transition and Wellbeing Research Program, the most comprehensive research program of its type undertaken in Australia. This $5 million research project, jointly funded by DVA and Defence, will examine the impact of military service on the mental, physical and social health of serving and ex-serving personnel who have deployed to contemporary conflicts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />For the first time, this will include a picture of the mental and physical health of service personnel after discharge and how mental health symptoms change over time. It will also investigate how individuals previously diagnosed with a mental health condition access care, as well as examining the experiences and needs of families of serving and ex-serving members. This is an important and tangible way to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the three studies being launched today, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Vietnam Veterans Family Study</span> focuses on the intergenerational effects of war serviceâ€”specifically Vietnam War service. This government places great store on the capacity and importance of families, as shown by our pre-election policy commitment to â€˜veterans and their familiesâ€™. We know that families play a central role in shaping the health and wellbeing of its members. The study confirms the importance of families and the need to connect them to support and programs. The study also shows that for this group of Vietnam veterans, there are some intergenerational effects for some children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are now a wide range of family supports available for all Australians, including resources for building better relationships through to dispute resolution. There are specific supports available for families with children who are at risk of separation, or who have separated. These mainstream supports are also complemented by veterans support for families, particularly through the VVCS. Family members can be affected by a loved oneâ€™s military service and are fundamental to the veteranâ€™s successful transition following deployments and separation from military service. It is extremely important to acknowledge that sons and daughters of Vietnam veterans of any age are eligible to access, and be supported by, the VVCS services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="page-break-after:avoid;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A major theme in common across the three studies is mental health, and how veterans and families are dealing with the mental health effects of war and peacekeeping. The Australian Defence Force has invested significant resources on mental health, with a focus on building the resilience and achieving capability through mental fitness. For instance, ADF personnel now receive psycho-educational training about the risks they will face before deployment and a range of post-deployment screenings to assess their coping and to determine whether they would benefit from additional support. In 2012-13, the government spent almost $179 million on meeting the mental health needs of the veteran and ex-service community. Funding for veteran mental health treatment is demand driven and it is not capped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key to good mental health is to take action early. The government has therefore invested considerably in providing veterans with more streamlined access to mental health treatment. The government can pay for treatment for diagnosed PTSD, depression, anxiety, and alcohol and substance use disordersâ€”whatever the cause. The condition does not have to be related to service. These arrangements are available to anyone who has deployed on operations overseas, and many who have served for more than three years at home. For instance, any of those who served in the Vietnam War or in peacekeeping operations are eligible for these arrangements. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WRIGHT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  On behalf of the Australian Greens, I would like to speak to the reports that have been tabled by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and reiterate the importance of having good research into the effects of service on Australia's military personnel, including peacekeepers, and also into the effects of that service on their families and dependents. My experience in meeting both veterans and their partners and children has confirmed for me what the research has indicated and what was referred to by Senator Ronaldsonâ€”that is, that there is substantial evidence to suggest that for those who serve on our behalf war has not only many physical costs but also costs from the dislocation of their lives and the necessity for them to reintegrate into the civilian workforce when they demobilise from their service. There are also the ongoing effects, sometimes psychological and in relation to stress. Those costs transfer to those who support them. The role of partners and families is absolutely crucial. It is incumbent upon us as a community that, when we ask people to serve on our behalf and put themselves in the frontline, at risk of physical and psychological injury, we support those who support them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will look forward to reading the reports that have been tabled today. We need to see important, reliable research translated into sensible and reliable policy that acknowledges the contribution that our veterans and their families make on our behalf. That is the big, really important question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that Australian society needs to be particularly grateful for not only the families, partners and children of veterans but also some of the organisations that work tirelessly to try to highlight the importance of having good research and good policy, including the Partners of Veterans Association of Australia and also their state counterparts and many small and large organisations that work for the welfare of partners and veterans throughout Australia. A matter that I have raised with the minister is that some of the partners associations, or many of them, do not actually have any real funding to keep them going, and I think it is important that we ensure that they can carry out that important advocacy and caring role, particularly in terms of reaching out to partners and families in rural and more isolated areas of Australia who often do not have the support networks that people in urban areas have. It can be very expensive to try to get out there to meet them. I know from the partners that I have spoken to how absolutely valuable that contact can be in keeping people going in their important work, in holding families together and in supporting their veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward, on behalf of the Australian Greens, to having a closer look at those reports.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the character and general visa cancellation provisions in the Migration Act to ensure that non-citizens who commit crimes in Australia, pose a risk to the Australian community or represent an integrity concern are appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation. The Bill also introduces a mandatory cancellation power for non-citizens who objectively do not pass the character test and are in prison. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current legislative framework for the character and general visa cancellation provisions has been in place for some time. The general visa cancellation framework has been in place, without significant change, since the Migration Reform Act came into effect in 1994. Similarly, the character framework has been in place since 1999 without significant change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since that time, the environment in relation to the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens has changed dramatically, with higher volumes of temporary visa holders in Australia and streamlined processes facilitating entry of temporary residents for economic and other purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that facilitation of entry at the visa application stage needs to be complemented with strong visa cancellation grounds and processes at the post visa grant stage to ensure the integrity of the Migration Programme. This includes having appropriate responses available where non-citizens in Australia do not abide by the law, including by breaching visa conditions, or engaging in criminal activity or migration fraud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with community views and expectations, the Australian Government has a low tolerance for criminal, non-compliant or fraudulent behaviour by non-citizens. Entry and stay in Australia by non-citizens is a privilege, not a right, and the Australian community expects that the Australian Government can and should refuse entry to non-citizens, or cancel their visas, if they do not abide by Australian laws. Those who choose to break the law, fail to uphold the standards of behaviour expected by the Australian community or try to intentionally mislead or defraud the Australian government should expect to have that privilege removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To meet this expectation the Government must not only have the ability to act decisively and effectively, wherever necessary, to deal with unlawful, fraudulent or criminal behaviour by non-citizens, but also have the legislative basis to effect a visa cancellation or refusal for those non-citizens. This Bill seeks to enhance the Government's ability to do so in three key ways: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, by amending section 501 of the Act to: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">broaden the existing grounds for not passing the character test; and </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">allow the Minister to require the head of an agency of a State or Territory to disclose to the Minister personal information that is relevant to whether the person passes the character test, and the possible refusal or cancellation of their visa under section 501.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments proposed in this Bill give the Government the necessary capabilities to identify non-citizens who are liable for visa cancellation under the character provisions, or refusal under the character provisions and deal with them appropriately. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By introducing a power to obtain personal information which assists with the identification and consideration of non-citizens potentially liable for visa cancellation or refusal under section 501, the Government will be able to deliver greater surety in its commitment to protecting the Australian community from harm as a result of criminal activity or other serious conduct by non-citizens including those who pose an integrity risk to the Migration Programme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similarly, the broadened grounds for not passing the character test, the increased capability to deal with fraud and integrity issues, and the introduction of a lower threshold for cancellation of temporary visas will provide the Government with the necessary tools to ensure that such people are subject to visa cancellation or refusal consideration under the appropriate provision of the Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed measures will amend the character test within section 501 of the Act to prescribe certain cohorts of non-citizens, such as those who have a charge proven for a sexual offence against a child, and persons involved in criminal conduct or activities such as people smuggling or war crimes, as not passing the character test. Additionally, amendments will be made to ensure that any non-citizen convicted of a crime or crimes, who receives a sentence totalling twelve months, regardless of how that total is reached, will fall within the definition of having a substantial criminal record and will not pass the character test. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Changes will be made to extend the character test to include non-citizens who commit crimes, but do not receive a sentence on the basis of issues surrounding their mental health. This cohort of people is often responsible for very serious offences, but under the current provisions, ensuring they are prevented from posing a further risk to the Australian community is difficult. The measures proposed will rectify that problem. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second key measure is to amend the general visa cancellation provisions within the Act to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">enhance measures for dealing with non-citizens who present an integrity, identity or fraud risk;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">introduce lower thresholds for cancelling temporary visas, reflective of the lower tolerance for behavioural concerns in the temporary visa context; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">introduce stronger personal Ministerial decision making powers in relation to the general visa cancellation provisions, consistent with those in the character provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Amendments proposed to section 116 of the Act will provide the necessary balance between the protection of the Australian community and the facilitation of entry for temporary visa holders. This cohort of non-citizens has until now been considered against thresholds similar to those applied in section 501, which are set at a high level to reflect the potential impact of removing a person's permanent visa. The amended provision will provide that non-citizens on temporary visas, who pose even a low level of risk, will be eligible for visa cancellation. Measures will also be introduced to better manage the cancellation of visas where the circumstances applicable to the grant of the visa never existed or no longer exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Act will also be amended to provide that a visa may be cancelled where incorrect information was provided by or on behalf of a non-citizen either as part of a statutory process, or outside of such a process, and was relevant to the person making a valid application for a visa or a decision to grant a visa to the person. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Act will also be amended to provide the Minister with the power to cancel a visa if he or she is not satisfied as to the visa holder's identity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures proposed will ensure that the Government can move quickly to take action against non-citizens who pose a risk to the Australian community by delivering consistency in personal Ministerial decision making powers across both the character and general visa cancellation powers. This will involve the introduction of personal Ministerial powers to set aside and substitute decisions of delegates and tribunals, and to cancel a visa personally on the grounds under section 109 or section 116 with or without natural justice where it is in the public interest to do so. The latter of these amendments ensures that where a real and immediate risk is posed by a non-citizen, the Government can act quickly and decisively to remove that person from the Australian community before that risk can be realised. As with the existing personal Ministerial decision making powers under the character provisions, such decisions would not be subject to merits review processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The third key measure this Bill seeks to introduce is mandatory visa cancellation under section 501 of the Act where a non-citizen is serving a full-time sentence of imprisonment in a custodial institution and they are found to objectively not pass the character test on the basis of, for example, having been convicted of an offence or offences and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more, or having been convicted of, or found to have been guilty of, or had a charge proved against them for a sexually based offence involving a child. Under this process, a non-citizen will have their visa mandatorily cancelled without prior notice of an intention to cancel a visa, with a notification of the cancellation decision provided after the fact. Upon notification, the non-citizen will be provided with the opportunity to seek revocation of the cancellation decision. Where a decision is taken by a delegate to not revoke the decision, the former visa holder will have access to merits review. This will be a streamlined process which will deliver the key benefit of providing a greater opportunity to ensure non-citizens who pose a risk to the community will remain in either criminal or immigration detention until they are removed or their immigration status is otherwise resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments are designed to strengthen and build upon the existing character and general visa cancellation framework and are consistent with the original intent of the provisions; to provide the Government with sufficient capability to address character and integrity concerns. This Bill addresses the significant changes in the environment relating to the entry and stay of non-citizens in Australia since mid to late 1990s and reflects this Government's and the Australian community's low tolerance for criminal, non-compliant or fraudulent behaviour by those who are given the privilege of holding a visa to enter and stay in Australia. The Bill demonstrates this Government's clear commitment to ensuring that non-citizens do not pose a risk to the Australian community. I commend the Bill to the Chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's rural industries are among the most innovative and productive in the world. The Australian Government is committed to ensuring their profitability and competitiveness, now and into the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government supports rural industries in a variety of ways. To help primary producers increase their output and improve their profit margins, we support rural research and development. Much of this support is channelled through the 15 rural research and development corporations. In addition, to keep our rural industries engaged and influential on the world stage, the government is a member of international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill implements a 2014 Budget measure to change the way that the government pays for its membership to these organisations. The Bill also reduces the red tape burden currently imposed on some of the rural research and development corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a member of the international wine, grains, sugar and cotton commodity organisations. These organisations work to improve the trading environment for agricultural products. They fund research and development on global issues affecting these industries, and provide useful information and statistics for our producers, scientists and research and development organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's membership to these organisations provides benefits to our primary producers. For example, the International Cotton Advisory Council sponsors research on the cost of cotton production and production methods to inform the cotton research community and primary producers. It has direct links with our Cotton Research and Development Corporation as part of its Research Associate Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Other roles of the international commodity organisations include setting international standards to improve production and product marketing, improving food safety and security. Just as our rural research and development corporations foster partnerships at home, the international commodity organisations promote global partnerships. If we do not engage with these organisations, they could develop standards that are not appropriate for Australian conditions and practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a member of six regional fisheries management organisations. Our commercial fishing and aquaculture industry is worth over $2 billion annually and employs around twelve thousand people. These organisations manage migratory fish species to ensure the optimal use of fish stocks to the benefit of our fishing industries. Through our membership of these organisations, we ensure that regional management measures are compatible with domestic arrangements, and secure access for the Australian fishing industry.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian research and development operates within a global system, and must take into account international issues. The change to the legislation reflects this, and also acknowledges that the ultimate beneficiaries of the activities of these international organisations are farmers, fishing industries and rural communities.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends three Acts to allow the government to recover the cost of the memberships from the Commonwealth funding provided to relevant rural research and development corporations. This will provide a funding mechanism for memberships to these organisations that is sustainable in a time of increasing budget pressures.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also reduces red tape for some of the research and development corporations.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill honours the Coalitions commitment to restore the full suite of border protection and immigration measures, abolished by the former Labor Government to stop the boats. The Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014 will amend the Migration Act 1958, the Migration Regulations 1994, the Maritime Powers Act 2013, and make minor changes to the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to support the Government's key election commitments to stop the boats and resolve Labor's 30,000 legacy caseload. These measures are a necessary extension and consolidation of the Government's successful border protection policies and are part of a broad package of measures which will tackle the management of the backlog of illegal maritime arrivals known as IMAs and bring important enhancements to the integrity of Australia's protection programme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to Australia's national security and economic prosperity in its efforts to combat the illegal and dangerous practice of people smuggling. These changes will further strengthen the Government's ability to manage illegal arrivals and strengthen public confidence in Australia's protection and migration programmes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Specifically, the Bill reintroduces Temporary Protection visas, introduces Safe Haven Enterprise visas which is also a temporary visa, reinforces the Government's powers to undertake maritime turn backs and introduces rapid processing and streamlined review arrangements. The measures deliver on the Government's election commitment to reintroduce temporary protection visas and ensure that no IMA will be granted a permanent protection visa it will also ensure efficient processing of Labor's backlog of 30,000 asylum seekers, as promised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the Maritime Powers Act strengthen Australia's maritime enforcement framework and the ongoing conduct of border security and maritime enforcement operations. Enforced turn backs are a critical component of the Governments suite of border protection measures that have been so successful in stopping the boats. These measures affirm and strengthen the Government's ability to continue this success. This will help ensure that the tap stays off and we never return to the cost, chaos and tragedy that Labor and the Greens created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments in Schedule 1 of this Bill reinforce the Government's powers and support for our officers conducting maritime operations to stop people smuggling ventures at sea. They provide additional clarity and consistency in the powers to detain and move vessels and people. They further clarify the relationship between the Maritime Powers Act and other laws, and clearly state that ministers can give directions in respect of the exercise of maritime powers. Finally, as was Parliament's original intent, the amendments support our Navy and Customs personnel to continue to do their difficult jobs efficiently, effectively and safely on the water. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments to the Maritime Powers Act are just one element of the Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It has been a clear policy of this Government to ensure that those who flagrantly disregard our laws and arrive illegally in Australia are not rewarded with a permanent protection visa. The reintroduction of TPVs in Schedule 2 of the Bill is fundamental to the Government's key objectives to process the current backlog of IMA protection claimants. The Government is not resiling from providing protection, but rather, is providing temporary protection to those IMAs who are found to engage Australia's protection obligations. TPVs will be granted for a maximum of three years and will provide access to Medicare, social security benefits and work rights, as occurred under the Howard Government. TPVs will provide refugees with stability and a chance to get on with their lives, while at the same time guaranteeing that people smugglers do not have a 'permanent protection visa product' to sell to those who are thinking of travelling illegally to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, consistent with this Government's principles of rewarding enterprise and its belief in a strong regional Australia, a new visa, the Safe Haven Enterprise Visa, will also be created. The Safe Haven Enterprise Visa will be will be open to applications by those who have been processed under the legacy caseload, and are found to be refugees. The SHEV will be an alternative temporary visa to the TPV, and encourages enterprise through earning and learning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">IMAs granted a SHEV will be required to confine themselves to designated regions (either a State or Territory government, local government, or employer can request to be designated), identified through a national self-nomination process. The visa will be valid for five years, and like the TPV will not include family reunion or a right to re-enter Australia. SHEV holders will be targeted to designated regions and encouraged to fill regional job vacancies and will have access to the same support arrangement as a TPV holder. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">SHEV holders who have worked in Regional Australia without requiring access to income support for three and a half years will be able to apply, and if they meet eligibility requirements, be granted other onshore visas, for example family and skilled visas as well as temporary skilled and student visas. They will not be able to apply for a permanent protection visa. Consultation with State, Territories and Local Government will inform the details of the criteria for this visa. Details will be included in the Regulations subsequent to the passage of this Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 of the Bill also includes the creation of authority in the Migration Act to make deeming regulations. The first time this authority is being used is to make regulations that deem IMAs who have a current on-hand permanent protection visa application to instead have applied for a Temporary Protection Visa. It also includes a minor amendment to the Migration Act to make clear that there may be multiple classes of Protection visas and to include an amended definition of Protection visas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 3 of the Bill will create an express link between certain classes of visa that are provided for under the Migration Act (including protection visas) and the criteria prescribed under the Regulations in relation to those visas, and ensure that non-citizens can only apply for those visas in accordance with the criteria set out in both the Migration Act and in the Regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is of the view that a 'one size fits all' approach to responding to the spectrum of asylum claims made under Australia's protection framework is inconsistent with a robust protection system that promotes efficiency and integrity. It limits the Government's capacity to address and remove those found to have unmeritorious claims quickly while diverting resources away from those individuals with more complex claims. A new approach is warranted in the Australian context. The Fast Track Assessment Process introduced by Schedule 4 of this Bill will efficiently and effectively respond to unmeritorious claims for asylum and will replace access to the Refugee Review Tribunal with access to a new model of review, the Immigration Assessment Authority known as the IAA. These measures are specifically aimed at addressing the backlog of IMAs and will ensure their cases progress towards timely immigration outcomes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All fast track applicants will have their protection claims fully assessed by my department under the Migration Act. However, it is the Government's policy that if fast track applicants present unmeritorious claims or have protection elsewhere, their cases will be channelled towards a direct immigration outcome rather than accessing merits review in order to prolong their stay in Australia. Such fast track applicants will be 'excluded fast track review applicants' and will not have access to any form of merits review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The IAA will be established as a separate office of the Refugee Review Tribunal. Eligible fast track review applicants will have their refusal cases automatically referred to the IAA and will not have to apply for a review by it. The IAA's primary function will be to conduct a review 'on the papers' only considering the material which was before my department when it made its refusal decision under section 65 of the Migration Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that a review applicant may have a genuine reason for not presenting all relevant claims in the first instance. In limited circumstances, the IAA has a discretionary power to get new information where the information is considered to be relevant, however, the IAA is under no duty to accept or request new information or interview an applicant. In keeping with this model of limited review, the Immigration Assessment Authority will not accept or consider any new information presented at review by a fast track review applicant unless exceptional circumstances apply and the IAA is satisfied that the new information was not, and could not have been provided to the department before the section 65 decision was made. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This new approach to review will discourage asylum seekers who attempt to exploit the current review process by presenting manufactured claims or evidence to bolster their original unsuccessful claims only after they learn why they were not found to be refugees by the department. This behaviour has on numerous occasions led to considerable delay while new claims are explored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Effective tools must be available to ensure that those who do not engage our protection obligations can be removed from Australia.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current view put forward by some advocates that a person who simply claims to be a refugee is a refugee, despite multiple assessments to the contrary is actually undermining the Refugees Convention. Those not found to be refugees have no right to stay in Australia and must depart.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 5 of the Bill will make clear that the removal power is available independent of assessments of Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">non refoulement</span> obligations, where a non-citizen meets the circumstances specified in the express provisions of section 198 of the Migration Act. This change is in response to a series of Court decisions which have found that the Migration Act as a whole is designed to address Australia's <span style="font-style:italic;">non refoulement</span> obligations, which has had the effect of limiting the availability of the removal powers. Asylum seekers will not be removed in breach of any <span style="font-style:italic;">non refoulement </span>obligations identified in earlier processes. The Government is not seeking to avoid these obligations, rather it seeks to be able to effect removals in a timely manner once the assessment of the applicant's protection claims has been concluded.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 5 of the Bill will also create a new, independent and self-contained statutory refugee framework which articulates Australia's interpretation of its protection obligations under the Refugees Convention. The Government remains committed to ensuring it abides by its obligations in respect to the Refugees Convention and this change does not in any way compromise this commitment. The new statutory framework will enable Parliament to legislate its understanding of these obligations within certain sections of the Migration Act without referring directly to the Refugees Convention and not be subject to the interpretations of foreign courts or judicial bodies, which seek to expand the scope of the Refugees Convention. The new framework clearly sets out the criteria to be satisfied in order to meet the new statutory definition of a 'refugee' and the circumstances required for a person to be found to have a 'well-founded fear of persecution' including where they could take reasonable steps to modify their behaviour to avoid the persecution. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let me be clear, the Government is not changing the risk threshold required for assessing whether a person has a well-founded fear of persecution. Under the new framework, refugee claims will continue to be assessed against the 'real chance' test, which has been the test adopted by successive Governments, in line with the High Court's decision in </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new framework will also clarify those grounds which exclude a person from meeting the definition of a refugee or which, upon a person satisfying the definition of a refugee render them ineligible for the grant of a Protection visa. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments contained in Schedule 6 reinforce the Government's view that the children of IMAs, who are born in Australia, are included within the existing definition of unauthorised maritime arrival known as UMA in the Migration Act. This will ensure that, consistent with their parents, these children are subject to offshore processing and are unable to apply for a visa while they remain in Australia, unless I have personally intervened to allow a visa application. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also extend the definition of an UMA to the children of IMAs born in a regional processing country. This amendment supports the Government's intention that IMA families in regional processing countries should be treated consistently and that children born to an IMA ought not be treated separately from their family in the protection assessment process. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Amendments will also be made to the Migration Act to ensure provisions relating to 'transitory persons' operate consistently.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From time to time, successive governments have found it necessary to 'cap' certain classes of either the Migration or the Humanitarian visa programmes, in order to ensure that Government annual targets are not exceeded. This is a vital programme management tool, particularly when exceeding targets may resolve in budget overspends. As a result of a recent High Court judgement regarding my use of the 'cap' for the onshore component of the Humanitarian programme, it has been necessary to make minor amendments to the Migration Act. The amendments in Schedule 7 of the Bill will put it beyond doubt that I may 'cap' classes of the migration or humanitarian programme when necessary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 7 will also repeal the 90-day time limit for deciding protection visa applications at both the primary and review stages of processing. The associated reporting requirements will also be repealed as they consume time and resources without adding value to overall Government objectives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill deserves the support of all parties. Just like our community continues to benefit significantly from the constant update in technology, the current management and assessment process of asylum seekers should equally be deserving of a commitment to innovation and improvement. The changes in this Bill will benefit the Australian community by providing us with the assurance of an effective, orderly and managed protection programme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has a clear mandate for these changes. There are no surprises here, this is the Government keeping its election commitments to stop the boats - upon which we are delivering - and resolve the legacy caseload, efficiently, quickly, fairly and with integrity. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill abolishes the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation by repealing the Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973. The Bill also provides for a number of consequential amendments to other Acts and sets out transitional provisions relating to the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Corporation to the Commonwealth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government announced as part of the 2014-15 Budget that it would be delivering smaller, more rational Government involving the abolition or merger of Government bodies where possible to reduce the cost of government administration for taxpayers. The reforms are expected to deliver net savings over the forward estimates period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the second phase of the smaller government agenda, the Government decided that the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation would be abolished with its remaining property management functions consolidated into the Commonwealth, as represented by the Department of Finance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2014 provides for the transfer to the Commonwealth of the remaining assets and liabilities of the Corporation at the time of its abolition.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The coalition government is committed to supporting the delivery of quality schooling and providing funding and regulatory certainty for all Australian schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Education Act 2013 </span>is the principal legislation by which the Australian Government provides financial assistance to approved authorities for government and nonâ€‘government schools. It enables expenditure of Australian Government funding for schools and related payments, and secures the reform and accountability objectives to improve the quality of education in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Act commenced on 1 January 2014. Australian Government funding for schools is provided to state and territory governments that are then required to distribute these funds in line with the requirements of the Act. In 2014, around $14 billion will be paid to government and nonâ€‘government school authorities under the Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will create a mechanism to enable payments to be made under the Government's Indigenous Boarding Initiative, an initiative designed to provide additional recurrent funding in 2014 to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boarding students at nonâ€‘government schools. The additional recurrent funding will be used by schools to deliver improved services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boarding students and provide additional support to boost school attendance and engagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will also provide funding certainty for certain independent special schools and special assistance schools that would otherwise see their funding reduced to the schooling resource standard from 2015. Instead, these schools will now transition towards the standard consistent with other schools. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the Act was passed by the 43<span style="color:gray;">rd</span> Parliament, a number of errors and oversights made during the original drafting have been identified which affect the proper administration of the legislation. This bill will correct these and provide greater certainty for schools about their funding entitlements for the current funding quadrennium.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Turning to the specifics of the bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 separate the measures that will come into effect at different times. Schedule 1 contains those amendments that will commence on Royal Assent, and Schedule 2 contains those amendments that need to be backdated to operate from the start of the Australian Education Act<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>on 1 January 2014. The need for amendments in Schedule 2 to apply retrospectively from 1 January 2014 is to ensure that funding calculations and payments made for 2014 are correct, so that all schools are funded as intended. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will create a new mechanism to make payments to schools in prescribed circumstances. The Regulations will contain the type of information the Minister must have regard to in exercising this new mechanism, both in terms of eligibility and calculation of funding, and be subject to review and disallowance by the Parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the first instance, this new mechanism will enable payment of the Australian Government's Indigenous Boarding Initiative. The initiative was announced in the 2014-15 Budget and will provide interim support for non-government schools with more than 50 Indigenous boarding students from remote or very remote areas, or where 50 per cent or more of their boarding students are Indigenous and from remote or very remote areas. This additional funding will assist non-government boarding schools to provide these students with a high quality education and support educational opportunities for Indigenous students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill allows for the correction of errors and oversights that have become apparent since the Act became operative on 1 January 2014. The bill will ensure that certain special schools or special assistance schools will not have their funding reduced in 2015. Currently, the safety net in place will disappear and these schools will have their funding immediately reduced to the schooling resource standard from 1 January 2015 because the current work with the states and territories to develop nationally consistent data has not yet been completed. The amendment will provide funding certainty by providing $2.4 million in funding for next year and ensuring these schools transition to the schooling resource standard in a manner consistent with other schools until the revised student with disability loadings are available. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will address a gap in the current Act dealing with the transitional arrangements to ensure that schools moving between approved authorities will be neither financially advantaged nor disadvantaged. A school moving to another approved authority will have, as a starting point for its Commonwealth funding entitlement under that approved authority, the amount that would have applied had the school not moved authorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will correct the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) index values for locations of schools, so that schools in inner regional locations are properly identified as such. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will correct a significant error that would see, for some school authorities, the Commonwealth liable to pay the entire amount (both Commonwealth and notional state share) calculated for an authority, rather than the Commonwealth's share of that calculated amount. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will insert the final 2014 amount for capital funding paid to Block Grant Authorities. This amount will be the basis for future capital funding amounts for Block Grant Authorities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will address a minor technical error and correct a cross-reference regarding the pro-rating of recurrent funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will provide greater flexibility and options for managing any non-compliance that occurred under the previous legislation, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Schools Assistance Act 2008</span>, should compliance action be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill clarifies the operation of reviewable decisions and will correct errors relating to who can apply for a review of a decision under the Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the bill will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Education (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2013</span> to extend to 1 January 2016, or a later date determined by the Minister, the commencement of school improvement planning requirements under the Act to provide regulatory certainty to schools while consultations with stakeholders occur in relation to possible adjustments to this requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill supports all Australian schools by correcting errors and omissions in the existing Act to ensure effective and efficient administration. Taking action to fix these problems will strengthen the legislative framework that underpins the Australian Government's significant investment in schools and contribute to improving the quality of school education in Australia.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased today to introduce the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008 to allow for a better process for waiving debts for dentists under the former Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Schemeâ€”dentists who did nothing more than make minor paperwork errors and who have been waiting too long for adequate resolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was set up by the current Prime Minister in 2007, when he was health Minister, and provided access to benefits of up to $4,250 over two calendar years for patients with chronic health conditions. 80 per cent of people who accessed this scheme were concession card holders. It was our country's biggest ever investment into dental care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This scheme provided much needed dental treatmentâ€”in fact more than 20 million services to more than one million patientsâ€”before the previous Labor government closed it down for political ends in 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In opposition I offered to compromise on design changes to the scheme which were never entertained by the then Government. Their desire was simply to destroy a scheme helping Australians solely because its architect was Tony Abbott.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme included a technical reporting requirement; a requirement that necessitated dentists provide treatment plans to general practitioners, along with a quote and treatment plan to patients, prior to commencing treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The then Government sought to use the dentists technical oversight as a means of discrediting the scheme, and it was a shameful act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Dentists who did not meet these reporting requirements have been pursued for repayment of the full amount of the Medicare benefits paid under the scheme although, in most cases, these dentists met all the other requirements of the scheme and provided much needed services to patients. They were simply used by Labor as political pawns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I made it clear previously in this House that recovery of the full benefit was an excessively severe punishment given that the only error these hard working professionals made was overlooking a paperwork requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Human Services sought to redress this issue by applying to the Minister for Finance to waive these debts under section 34 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, this process has so far been extremely time consuming and resource intensive for the Departments of Finance and Human Services. It has also created anxiety and uncertainty for dentists who have been waiting for long periods of time to find out if their debts have been waived.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will relieve the uncertainty for dentists by allowing faster processing of the waivers. It does so by allowing the Chief Executive of Medicare to waive the debts of those dentists who did not meet the paperwork requirements without the need to go through the current lengthy process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let me be clearâ€”this amendment will not excuse those dentists who did not comply with other legal requirements of the scheme or who committed fraud. Only those dentists who provided services in good faith will be eligible to have their debt waived. And we know that these dentists are in the majority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Dentists who, in good faith, did the right thing by their patients and provided them with much needed services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I turn now to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. The programme commenced on 1 January 2014 and provides access to benefits for basic dental services to children aged 2-17 years. The total benefit entitlement is capped at $1,000 per child over a two calendar year period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The CDBS has a means test, which requires receipt of Family Tax Benefit Part A or a relevant Australian Government payment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008 to introduce critical changes for the efficient operation of the Child Dental Benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure that compliance audits of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule are more efficient and effective, this bill introduces amendments which will bring the compliance framework for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule into greater alignment with Medicare's compliance framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It does so by including the power to compel a provider to comply with a request to produce documents to substantiate the payment of benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These powers in this bill will enable the Chief Executive of Medicare or a relevant officer of the Department of Human Services to give a notice to a practitioner, requiring them to produce documents to a practitioner, or another relevant person, to confirm appropriate Medicare claiming is occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Penalties will apply to individuals who fail to comply with a notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill also amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008 so that the provisions of the Professional Services Review scheme can be applied to any dental services provided under the Child Dental Benefits Schedule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Professional Services Review is an independent authority which examines suspected cases of inappropriate practice referred to it by the Department of Human Services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Professional Services Review can currently investigate cases of inappropriate practice under the Medicare programme and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, these critical amendments to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule will make the Schedule more efficient, ensure that Commonwealth funding is being used appropriately, and promote a more consistent compliance structure for both Medicare and dental programmes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, the Bill makes a number of technical amendments to ensure the efficient and effective operation of both the Dental Benefits Act and the Child Dental Benefits Schedule.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  Before question time in this second reading contribution I was making the point that the life span of too many sunset clauses in security legislation has been too long and that it is simply not possible to predict the nature and extent of terrorist threats over a 10-year period, which some of those sunset clauses were. Giving future sunset clauses around a three-year life span is much more appropriate to meet the immediate threats to national security and to give a new parliament with a fresh perspective the opportunity to reconsider their necessity. I acknowledge that the government has accepted the PJCIS recommendations for substantially reduced time frames on sunset clauses for controversial provisions in this bill and the decision by the government in response to the work of the PJCIS I say is a good one. A mandatory review by the PJCIS assisted by the legislation monitor review should be conducted before expiry of a sunset clause provision. The committee should undertake a comprehensive review of the terms and operations of the legislation and gather information from stakeholder agencies as well as take public submissions and make considered recommendations to the parliament. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only has oversight of the intelligence agencies, in my view, failed to keep pace with their burgeoning role and powers but it has been decades since the effectiveness and adequacy of the oversight framework has been critically examined. It is time to satisfy the Australian community, the parliament and the agencies themselves that we have got this right. The time has come for a thorough review of the current arrangements for oversight of Australian intelligence agencies. I believe that such an inquiry should encompass the role, powers and scope of existing oversight mechanisms and consider the adequacy of the legislative framework which governs oversight, the degree to which it is coordinated and comprehensive and whether the resources allocated to such bodies are adequate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enhanced power requires enhanced accountability. The greater potential for that power to infringe on individual liberties, the greater the need for accountability in the exercise of that power. This is not to suggest that our security and intelligence agencies are acting perniciously or misusing their powers but in the relatively recent past those powers were used inappropriately with consequent erosion of public trust.</span>

In my view, and I hope this is a view shared around the parliament, it is time to satisfy the Australian community, to satisfy the parliament and to satisfy the agencies themselves that we have got this right. I commend this approach to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="3L6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. I am pleased to serve as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security which reviewed this bill. This bill is the latest phase in an ongoing process of updating our national security legislation. The threats that Australia faces are constantly evolving, and our security apparatus must also evolve to keep pace with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most notable recent development has been the movement of Australian citizens to other nations to participate in foreign wars. We know that around 160 Australians have already become involved with extremist groups in Iraq and Syria either through travelling to the region or by providing support from within Australia. If they successfully join up with extremist groups, foreign fighters learn the skills, develop the networks and adopt a hardened ideology that makes them a serious threat to Australians if they return home. I support the great work that our security agencies do in identifying individuals who are planning to leave Australia to join organisations such as ISIL. It is vital that parliament provides our national security agencies with the tools that they need to keep Australia safe. That is what this legislation does, and that is why Labor supports it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains a broad range of measures designed to address the foreign fighter threat and amends more than 20 Commonwealth acts. The bill also implements recommendations from the 2013 COAG review and a number of reports from the former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. The new measures in this bill include a new power for interim suspension of passports. This will assist agencies in proactively addressing concerns that an individual may be preparing to go overseas to commit an offence. These powers will lower the evidence threshold required for a passport to be suspended temporarily and without notifying the individual whose passport has been cancelled. These new measures will assist security agencies to respond quickly when new concerns are raised. They will also allow agencies to cancel a suspect's passport without potentially threatening an ongoing investigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill merges the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act into the Criminal Code and provides harmonisation with the code's anti-terror provisions. These new and updated provisions provide a standardised legislative approach to terrorism related offenses and update the definitions of certain offenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill creates a new offense for entering, or remaining in, an area declared by the foreign minister. Declared areas are places where listed terrorist organisations are engaged in hostile activitiesâ€”with parts of Syria and northern Iraq being the most relevant current examples. This will assist our security agencies to identify individuals and ensure that they have or had a legitimate reason for entering a known area of terrorist activity. Individuals will not have committed an offense by entering a declared area if they are providing humanitarian aid, visiting family or working as a journalist or have other wholly legitimate reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are changes to the law of evidence to facilitate the use of overseas evidence in prosecutions of foreign fighters. This change simply reflects the changing world in which we live. In our interconnected world, Australian courts need greater flexibility when determining whether to use evidence from overseas in terrorism related proceedings. This allows the great work that Australian security agencies do with their international colleagues to be used, where appropriate, to prosecute individuals who have broken Australian laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a new evidence-tampering offence. This is one activity that I think many Australians would be surprised to know is not already against the law. Currently, if a warrant is issued under section 34L(6) of the ASIO Act, it is not an offence to destroy evidence that is requested. That is, very rightly, being corrected here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is lowering the legal threshold for arrest without warrant for terrorism offences. This will allow an AFP officer to arrest someone without a warrant where they 'suspect on reasonable grounds' that someone has committed or is committing a terrorism related offense. The new threshold provides the AFP with the ability to move quickly to prevent a terrorist act from occurring or to disrupt the planning of a terrorist act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a new power to seize bogus travel documents. Again, this is probably another area where many Australians would be surprised that a new law is even required. While it is current practice for customs and border protection officials to prevent individuals from using bogus documents to enter or leave Australia or to apply for a visa, it is perhaps surprising that they do not currently have the power to seize those documents. This new power will allow customs and border protection officials to seize bogus documents, thus preventing the individual using them from trying their luck a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will provide for information-sharing between AUSTRAC and the Attorney General's Department to help combat terrorism financing. The impact that the global financing of terrorism has had on the emergence of terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL cannot be understated. It is vital that Australia does all that it can to prevent money leaving Australia if it is destined for a terrorist organisation anywhere in the world. AUSTRAC hold a great deal of financial intelligence and they are experts in this field. This change will allow them to work more closely with our security agencies to ensure that any information they gather can be used in the fight against global terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the introduction of delayed notification search warrants for terrorism offences. This new power will allow the AFP to conduct a search of a premises without the occupier of that premises being made aware of that search. Allowing the AFP to gather information through the execution of a search warrant, while allowing the investigation to remain covert, is considered especially valuable. The AFP now have significant operating experience investigating terrorist groups and they believe that this new power will greatly assist their investigations into particularly resilient groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes measures to extend the sunset clauses for legislation empowering: the AFP control orders; the ASIO questioning and detention powers; and the AFP preventative detention orders. The extension of the sunset clauses on these powers has been done in recognition of the ongoing nature of the terrorist threat to Australia and the importance of these powers in our fight against terrorism. These powers are particularly important as they provide security agencies with proactive measures of dealing with terrorist threats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been some changes to the control order regime in response to the COAG review, which recommended some additional safeguards. It is important that these safeguards remain in place so that the community can be assured that these powers continue to be used effectively and efficiently to combat terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill creates a new offence for 'advocacy of terrorism', and the introduction of 'advocacy of terrorism' as the grounds for proscription of a terrorist organisation. It will now be an offence to intentionally urge or counsel the commissioning of a terrorist act. This is a sensible new law, as there can be little doubt that the decision to spread a message of hate, division and violence has no place in Australian society. This sends a clear message that we will not sit by while cowards encourage others to murder and maim, thinking themselves safe from our laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for the expansion of the power to collect biometric information on Australian citizens at airports. This new technology is the cutting edge of counter-terrorism efforts in Australia and around the world. It is vital that Australia does everything it can to secure its borders, and this cannot be done unless the correct identity of everyone seeking to arrive or leave the country can be assured. I was pleased that the PJCIS was able to ensure that additional information, like iris and fingerprint information, will not be included in the biometric information collected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of the PJCIS, I am pleased to see that the government has accepted all of the 36 recommendations. Key recommendations from the committee include amending sunset periods for a number of new and existing powers to ensure that these powers are only used for as long as they are necessary. Another recommendation relates to additional reviews of these powers to ensure that they are operating as intended and that they successfully provide security agencies with the tools that they need to keep Australians safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to echo some of Senator Faulkner's comments about the need for greater scrutiny while there are greater powers being endorsed by the parliament. As I have outlined here, there are greater powersâ€”important and necessary powersâ€”but there are also important and necessary safeguards which are needed and they will continue to be needed. There will be debate about those oversight powers, and I welcome that and I think that all in this chamber should welcome that debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this bill will provide Australia's security agencies with the updated toolkit that they need to protect Australians from terrorism. These measures are reasonable and proportionate, given the threats that we now face. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I07" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LUDLAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  It is with no great pleasure that I rise tonight to speak on this bill. I add my contribution to that of our spokesperson, Senator Penny Wright. I want to acknowledge and congratulate her and her staff for pulling together a remarkable dissenting reportâ€”given the extraordinary time pressure that the crossbenchers, opposition senators, committee staff and, most particularly, expert witnessesâ€”who were brought together to assess this bill that the government proposes to shotgun through this placeâ€”were under. I do not use that term 'shotgun' lightly, but it is apt when you look at the process by which this government is putting this bill forward. I want to quickly sketch what has led us to this sorry place that we are in today with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the second of two national security bills, although the government is proposing that a metadata retention bill also be included in the series. I do not include that in a set of three because I think it is only tangentially related to national security, but this one does. I will say at the outset that the general premise of the government is sound in being concerned about people returning from conflicts overseas after potentially coming into contact with extreme ideologies or being steeped in those ideologies and returning home with potentially post-traumatic stress disorder after being involved in goodness knows what kind off violent conflicts. It is an issue that has been acknowledged across the spectrum, but I do question whether this bill makes any substantive or meaningful contribution towards protecting people from foreign fighters. That is not to say that the issue does not exist; it has of course existed for years. I would be interested to know, for example, whether the government has given any thought to combatants on either side who might have travelled to Gaza during Israel's recent bombardment there or whether they somehow are not to be considered within the scope of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would normally have been submitted to the Senate Standing Legal and Constitutional Affairs Reference Committee, which my colleague Senator Wright chairs, but the Legislation Committee, which Senator Ian Macdonald chairs, decided not to assess the bill and it was instead sent to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. After it came to power last September, the government eliminated the crossbench spot on that committeeâ€”Senator Faulkner made some comments in that regard not too long ago. It is a committee that excludes the crossbench, who make up a representation of 18. It is the largest ever representation in this chamberâ€”not just the Greensâ€”with people from right across the political spectrum and right across the country who have been blocked from assessing the bill and talking to expert witnesses. Then the bill is brought back in here as a fait accompli with a set of amendments agreed to by the opposition, as Senator Conroy has just outlined. So there was no involvement of the crossbench or of Senate Standing Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. It has been a very rapid process, which nearly all of the witnesses, who did manage to pull high-quality submissions together, acknowledgedâ€”and too fast to properly evaluate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Security Legislation Monitor, as Senator Wright acknowledged in her contribution, has been vacant since April. That is the office that is meant to assess whether counter-terrorism legislation is necessary and proportionate. That is the measure with which the government holds the potential future office of the monitor in contemptâ€”in very low regardâ€”because the government has ignored a substantive amount of the recommendations that Mr Walker SC made in the last series of reports that he tabled on issues of direct relevance to this bill. You have not even bothered to re-appoint the office; you have been happy to leave that lie vacant since April. Senator Brandis is always proud to come in here and say that it was one of his colleagues, Senator Judith Troeth, who brought that bill forward. It was a private senator's bill that I co-sponsored and brought through here. It did not pass for well over a year, but, nonetheless, the office existed until April when the government thought it could wipe it out because that is how little it cares about oversight and accountability. It is disgusting. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Inspector General of Intelligence and Security deals only with the aftermathâ€”deals with issues at the end of the pipeâ€”and does not really have a policy-evaluation role on whether laws like this are necessary or proportionate. That is where we have been left. Perhaps the minister at the table can correct me, but it is my understanding that at about 12.30 tomorrow there will be a gag motion moved and this debate will be shut down. That is treating this chamber with contempt. Whether you support the bill or not, whether you support the amendments or not, this process of simply shotgunning legislation as dangerous as this through this place is absolutely appalling. Why exactly is the government in such a hurry? Yes, I agree that there is a legitimate public policy issue with combatants returning from violent conflicts overseas. Australians have been transiting in and out of Syria, through the gruesome civil war there, for three or four years that we know of. Why the sudden urgency over the last couple of weeks? People can draw their own conclusions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, the opposition has simply given this bill a free pass, as they did with the ASIO Bill. After the bill had passed we saw a remarkable outpouring of regret from people as diverse as shadow minister Albaneseâ€”I guess speaking in a private capacityâ€”Greg Sheridan, from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>; Janet Albrechtsen; and an entire spectrum of commentators around civil rights, civil society and industry. I wonder whether we are going to see a similar performance from the Labor spokesperson on this bill. It is, once again, left to the crossbenchers to provide the opposition in this country. I do not know what Senator Lambie is going to say, and I will not speak for the other crossbenchers, but it appears that the crossbench is the last remaining place in this chamber where critical thought on such bills resides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anthony Byrne, whom I hold in quite high regard, was chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security last year and I think he is the deputy chair of the committee now. He made some really perceptive comments a couple of months ago about the counter-terrorism legislation. Before ISIS really got a grip on western Iraqâ€”although it had obviously been festering in Syria for a long period of timeâ€”Mr Byrne commented in an interview:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is best that we have these debates around legislation as fraught as this in the light of day without some kind of pressure, without having to operate in the context of some kind of security emergency or heightened state of alarm. It is best that we hold these debates in a more measured way than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think he is quite correct. Of course, what he left out is that the reason he presumably failed to move for that is that he knew the Labor Party would not be able to withstand the onslaught and would cave in. That is why it is best to be having these conversations in a more measured wayâ€”and, of course, we not. By this time tomorrow this bill will have been sent back to the House and will be on its way to being law. Again, it is left to the crossbenchers to provide that critical thought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From my analysis, and the detailed and extremely valuable dissenting report that Senator Penny Wright has put forward, what we see is a mash-up of different causes. Some measures are sensible and necessary. Some measures are redundant because there are already provisions in criminal law that cover those offences. It makes it look much more as though somebody just wanted to draft some laws to look as though we are doing something, to be able to call a press conference and say we have passed some new laws. Actually, many of the things in this bill are redundant because offences have existed for a long period of time for the kinds of incitement to violence and criminal conspiracy that this bill, for some reason, thinks it is making an improvement on. Thirdly, there are measures that are simply dangerous and should not be in Australian law. Those obviously include the measures that Mr Walker, SC, believes should be taken off the statute books and not be given those additional sunset causes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens recommend that the bill not be passed in its current form. I think it is a great tragedy that the committee stage debate, where we actually get to have a reasoned discussion and debate about amendments, is likely to be cut short tomorrow by this gag motion that the government seems to be intending to move. Preventive detention orders should be removed from the Criminal Code. Control orders should be amended in line with recommendations by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, whom Senator Brandis seems to hold in high esteemâ€”except he wanted to abolish the office and has not bothered to appoint another one. At least have the grace to read the reports that the guy produced, since his primary mandate was to assess precisely these kinds of clauses and work out whether they are necessary and proportionate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will also be opposing the schedules of the bill that seek to expand the collection, use and sharing of biometric material in airport passenger processing systems. This is one of the most troubling aspects of the bill. It goes to schedule 5â€”the use of automated border processing control systems to identify particular individuals in immigration clearance. Actually, this will pass substantive automated surveillance technologies across the entire travelling population. And those measures proposed in schedule 6, as the dissenting report points out, seek to extend the use of biometric material as part of the advanced passenger processing system. This can impact on the privacy of a vast number of people who are suspected of nothing at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I think the Privacy Commissioner told the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security that a privacy impact assessment should be undertaken. But there is nothing in sight; the government does not appear to be interested in that at all. The commissioner said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such an assessment could be done in a way to help inform the bill to see whether any additional safeguards need to be built into the legislative base to add additional protections to that information.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And isn't it extraordinary that the minister representing in this capacity was still tabling explanatory memoranda to a bill that is still under developmentâ€”apparentlyâ€”even though we have been debating it in here for several hours. That is the kind of debacle you walk into when you bring a bill through here were such a rush. Nearly everybody who made a submission on this bill acknowledged that it was being done much, much too quickly. And we have not heard from any coalition spokesperson thus far about the case for this extra ordinary haste.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This balance can be achieved by ensuring that where the handling of an individual's personal information is authorised in the broader interests of the community, including upholding national security, those activities are accompanied by an appropriate level of privacy safeguards and accountability.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw the chamber's attention to a joint statement on this legislation, the Foreign Fighters bill, titled 'Don't rush through unnecessary counter-terror laws that erode democratic rights and freedoms'. It was countersigned by 43 separate organisations. They make the case that the government denies our elected representatives and the community the opportunity to fully debate the changesâ€”again, making the case for the extreme urgency that has been pressed. They make what I think is a profoundly important point. I will read briefly from the beginning of the statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has an important duty to protect the community from terrorism. At times, laws can legitimately limit the rights of individuals for the purpose of countering this threat, provided the limitations are necessary and proportionate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, national security laws and the protection of human rights share complementary goals; both are concerned with protecting Australians from harm.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dichotomy that is put to us from the Prime Minister's office downâ€”that we need to give up some of our rights in order to increase securityâ€”is exposed quite elegantly in this statement as false:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You do not increase one by obliterating the other, yet that is precisely what this bill does.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that agents or police can enter your home, or enter the home or premises of somebody who is not actually suspected of any offence, and not even have to notify anybody that that has occurred until months afterwards is characteristic of a police state. Preventative detention is characteristic of a police state. These are very, very dangerous powers that we play around with here, and once they are on the statute books, as Mr Walker quite correctly points out, they are inordinately difficult to get rid of. That is why the Greens believe, firstly, that the bill should not pass in the current form and, secondly, that the governmentâ€”perhaps with the support of the opposition; I do not knowâ€”should rethink the unnecessary haste with which this legislation is being bashed through the parliament. The one thing that we do not want to see is a repeat of what happened after the ASIO bill. That bill was passed late at night in extraordinary haste and then in the following days the editorial pages, the TV shows, and the op-ed opinion pieces that came out said, 'What the hell have we done? How did we let this happen? Why was this done?' We are hoping for that kind of critical thinking and analysis before the bill passes, not after.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We put the government on notice about their so-called third tranche of legislation. As I said before, I think that that legislation is only peripherally related to national security, because there are a multitude of other agencies that are accessing metadata on a warrantless basis. It is not really a national security bill at all. That, again, is a line that we call on the Labor Party to step back from. Start behaving like a party of opposition. I thank the chamber.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  I rise today in support of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. This bill introduces measures to support Australia's security agencies to ensure that Australians are as safe and secure as we can make them, without stripping away the freedoms we value and, in fact, are fighting to protect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">National security must always be a primary priority of our national government, but so too must the preservation of our democratic freedoms. These are two seemingly incompatible policy objectives; to balance them is never easy and is always rightly contested in this place. There is no doubt, however, in my mind that the Islamic State is a threat to our democratic values, our people, our institutions and our Australian way of life. Their attempt to gain resources, ground and manpower, both in Australia and abroad, must be resisted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1986, Margaret Thatcher noted in a speech to the British parliament:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ terrorism thrives on a free society. The terrorist uses the feelings in a free society to sap the will of civilisation to resist. If the terrorist succeeds, he has won and the whole of free society has lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She also noted:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Terrorism has to be defeated; it cannot be tolerated or side-stepped. When other ways and other methods have failedâ€”I am the first to wish that they had succeededâ€”it is right that the terrorist should know that firm steps will be taken to deter him from attacking either other peoples or his own people who have taken refuge in countries that are free.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My own experiences in government, dealing with the threats of al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, taught me that terrorists do not respect compassion; they see it as a weakness for them to exploit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This threat is real, and we have seen it before. Between 1990 and 2010, 30 Australians are known to have fought or trained with extremist groups in conflict zones at the time, including Pakistan and Afghanistan. Of these, 25 returned to Australia, 19 became involved in activities in Australia prejudicial to our national security and eight were convicted of terrorism related offences. Since that time, the evolution of technology and social media in an increasingly globalised world presents new opportunities for those who would seek to do us harm and new national security challenges for us all to address. The phenomenon of foreign fighters who are recruited by these new means underscores the connection between events overseas and the security of our own communitiesâ€”as the recent events in Canada remind us. Today, at least 185 Australians have become involved with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq by travelling to the region, attempting to travel to the region or supporting groups operating there from Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Leyonhjelm might be right that a 17-year-old from Bankstown is, to paraphrase him, 'an idiot'. But what Senator Leyonhjelm did not tell you is that, while he is 17 and he may be an idiot, he is now a radicalised and trained terrorist. His age is immaterial to his intent and his ability to do us harm should he return to Australia. History has shown us time and time again that child soldiers, once radicalised, are often the most brutal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill introduces a range of measures to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism legislative framework, and ensure that our domestic security agencies are empowered to do their jobs on our behalf. A new offence will make it illegal to intentionally counsel, promote, encourage or urge the doing of a terrorist act. There have been suggestions that this law will impact on free speech; however, as with everything, there must be a balance between protecting the rights of free speech and protecting the rights of individuals to go about their lives without the threat of terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, what has not yet been acknowledged by some opposite is that this bill does contain safeguards within the provision designed to protect free speech. The offences makes reference to the existing defence of 'acts done good faith' to protect the implied freedom of political communication. It will also exclude acts like publishing a report or commentary about a matter of public interest in good faith. The bill also seeks to extend sunset clauses for a number of measures, including control orders, preventative detention orders, ASIO questioning, and questioning and detention orders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the fact that as a result of the PJCIS report the sunset clauses will be reduced significantly from what they were originally proposed to be. I believe these powers are essential components of Australia's anti-terrorism legislative framework. They play a crucial role in mitigating, deterring and responding to terrorist threat Australia and extending these sunset provisions will allow future governments to reassess the security environment and determine whether these powers are still required. The bill provides more powers to our security agencies to deal with what I believe is a clear and current threat of terrorism within Australia posed by foreign fighters seeking to return to our country. It will also improve Australian border security measures and introduce measures to cancel welfare payments for persons involved in terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an essential component of the government's reform to national security legislation. The threat posed by foreign fighters returning to Australia is real. It is not overstated nor is it something that can be ignored. Australians who travel to fight with the Islamic State should not be allowed to bring their abhorrent brand of extremism back to Australia. As technology and threats change, so must legislation. These changes must be responsive and timely to ensure that our security organisations are able to effectively respond to these emerging threats, as they clearly have today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill is both necessary and appropriate legislation at this time. I congratulate the Labor Party for their bipartisan approach and constructive amendments to this bill. I believe this bill strikes a clear balance between security and individual freedom, and I commend it to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader and Deputy Whip of the Palmer United Party in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I rise to briefly contribute the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 and acknowledge the sincere, well thought out and robust contributions other members of this chamber from both sides have made to this legislation. I would also like to thank and pay tribute, once again, to the public servants, security and police officers who risk their lives to protect us from our enemies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have real concerns about the impact that this legislation will have on the civil rights and individual democratic freedoms of Australian citizens. I understand that those civil rights and freedoms were hard fought for and that members of our ADF shed blood and died for these freedoms. Those freedoms and rights are a legacy and a precious gift of previous generations, which I cherish and reflect on every time I visit the graves and war memorials in Tasmania. So I am very reluctant to vote for legislation which brings about the lessening of these rights and freedoms for Tasmanians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, with the recent and unprecedented rise of Islamic extremism; their vile killings, torture and beheadings of innocents; and the Islamic extremists' declaration of war on Australia and other western nations, followed up with coordinated attacks around the world, there is a clear and pressing social and national security need to strengthen the laws that will enable the brave and courageous public servants, security and police officer do their jobs and protect us all from the maniacs and psychopaths who would do us harm for no other reason than that we will not submit to their will and barbarous medieval culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the Attorney-General and head of ASIO for their briefing on this legislation and I am glad that they have taken on board my suggestion regarding a shortening of the sunset clause time frame. The management and carriage of these laws must have strong oversight. The government's sunset time period was 10 years; I would have liked to see a review by the parliament every two to three years. The government has agreed to every four years. This is a good outcome for two important reasons: firstly, to ensure that no inefficiencies or misconduct have crept into the administration and delivery of these laws over time; and to respond to the rapidly changing types and levels of threat posed by the terrorists, their allies and their agents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our defence experts tell us that we are in for a long fightâ€”it could be 100 yearsâ€”against the Islamic terrorists, so a shorter period of review than 10 years contained in this bill would be an appropriate amendment to this legislation. In other words, the sunset clause must allow for review every three years. It is also worthwhile to note in the context of this debate that this legislation and its specific measures are a reaction to an aggressive, hostile ideology which has been adopted by brutal Islamic foreigners and their supporters and allies in Australia. If we are going to find a cure for the disease of extremism, we must attack the extremists' ideology and we must root out and expose the extremists supporters who are living among us, who are more than likely sustained by our welfare entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is clearly an attempt to regain control over the radical Islamic groups in Australian. The PM could also regain control over the radical Islamic groups in Australia who are freely preaching hate and urging their followers to strengthen their allegiances to foreign powers. This is by introducing new laws which strip them of the right to vote and receive public benefits. It is easy for the PM to order troops to the Middle East and make out that he is tough on terrorism; but as witnessed by an Islamic radical group's recent rally in Western Sydney and their public statements from its leaders, the PM has for a long time turned a blind eye to the real threat of home-grown terrorism in our own backyard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr al-Wahwah, the president of the radical Islamic group Hizb ut-Tahrirâ€”if the media has reported correctlyâ€”has made a speech which contains implied threats of violence against the Australian people and has clearly declared his personal allegiance and his group's allegiance to an anti-democratic foreign power. Under section 44 of the constitution he and his group's members would not be allowed to stand for the Australian parliament because of their divided loyalties and obvious allegiances to foreign powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore the Prime Minister should introduce new laws which expand the legal principle of non-allegiance to a foreign power found in section 44 of the Constitution, which strips people who are members of groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir of their Australian citizenship and right to vote. I wonder how many of the people at Mr Al-Wahwah's rally in Western Sydney who are advocating for sharia law and loyalty to foreign powers enjoy Australian social services payments, entitlements and democratic freedoms? If they are going to carry on with that sort of rot the first thing we should ensure is that they do not receive any government funds or entitlements, that they do not have the right to vote and that they are deported immediately. Our taxes should be exclusively reserved for people who love Australia, who have undivided loyalties to our nation and who do not have formal or informal allegiances to foreign powers. They should not be used for those whose loyalties are clearly with foreign religious leaders and foreign anti-democratic laws. I will repeat what I have said before: if your loyalties and allegiances to foreign powers are so strong that you want to live under a foreign law and antidemocratic customs then please leave us in peace and get out of Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These laws are dealing with the symptoms of sick, depraved minds driven by perverted ideology. I think there is also an opportunity to introduce new laws based on section 44 of our Constitution, which says that you cannot have 'allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power' and expect to represent the Australian people in this parliament. These new laws could strip people of their Australian citizenship, right to vote, right to receive Australian taxpayers' money and, in some cases, deport or jail those who clearly have allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a hostile foreign power.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After those general comments and overview of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 I now turn to the specific provisions of the bill. Following the passage of this bill, an organisation can be listed as a terrorist organisation if the organisation directly or indirectly counsels, promotes, encourages or urges the doing of a terrorist act. Item 64 of schedule 1 would amend the criteria by which an organisation can be listed as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code. Paragraph 102.1(1A) of the Criminal Code will be amended by the addition of the words 'promotes and encourages'.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The control order provisions in division 104 of the Criminal Code allow a range of restrictions to be placed on an individual's liberty for the purpose of preventing terrorist acts. For example, an individual subject to a control order may be required to remain in a specified place at specified times and to wear an electronic monitoring device. They may also be prohibited from being in certain areas or from communicating or associating with specified individuals.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, a senior member of the Australian Federal Police may seek the Attorney-General's consent to request an interim control order from an issuing court if he or she (a) considers on reasonable grounds that the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act; or (b) suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has provided training to, or received training from, a terrorist organisation. The issuing court may then make an interim control order if it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, of either of those grounds. Where subsequently confirmed by the issuing court, a control order may last for a maximum of 12 months.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would expand the grounds on which a senior AFP officer may seek the Attorney-General's consent to request an interim control order. It would do so with regard to both grounds (a) and (b) set out above. First, with regard to ground (a), the officer would need only suspectâ€”rather than 'consider'â€”on reasonable grounds that the order would substantially assist in preventing a terrorist act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regular search warrant schemes require the officers executing a warrant to provide a copy of the warrant to the owner or occupier of the premises and allow that person to observe the search. This means that once a search is conducted, suspects are aware of police interest in their activities. This can present difficulties for law enforcement, particularly in the context of investigations into multiple suspects over an extended period.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If members of a terrorist group are alerted to investigator's knowledge of their activities, the success of the law enforcement operation could be jeopardised. For example, a suspect whose premises are searched under the current regime would be notified of police interest in their activities. A suspect could then undertake counter-surveillance measures, change their plans to avoid further detection, relocate their operations, or relocate or destroy evidence of their activities. It would also provide a suspect with the opportunity to notify their associates, who may not yet be known to police, allowing the associates to cease their involvement with the known suspect, destroy evidence or avoid detection in other ways. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the name suggests, 'delayed notification search warrants' fall between regular search warrant schemes and covert search warrant schemes. Covert search warrant schemes allow searches to be conducted without any notification of the owner or occupier of premises in the same fashion as other covert methods, such as surveillance devices and telecommunications interception. Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory provide for covert search warrants for suspected terrorism offences. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like control orders, preventative detention ordersâ€”PDOsâ€”were introduced in the Commonwealth jurisdiction by the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005, following on from the COAG agreement. The purpose of the PDO regime in division 105 of the Criminal Code is to allow a person to be taken into custody for a limited time period in order to either prevent an imminent terrorist act from occurring or preserve evidence of, or in relation to, a recent terrorist act.</span>

An order extending the period of detention to 48 hours may only be granted by certain members of the judiciary and certain members of the AAT. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2005, the PDO regime was reviewed by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitorâ€”the INSLMâ€”and the COAG review committee, both of which recommended the repeal of the provisions. Under the bill, the PDO regime would be retained and amendments made that would make them more accessible. The INSLM made three recommendations for amendments to the PDO regime if it were, against its main recommendation, retained. The bill would implement one of them in full and another in part.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For entering or remaining in a declared area, the bill would create a new offence punishable by 10 years imprisonment which would be made out where a person enters or remains in a declared area. The Minister for Foreign Affairs would be able to declare an area in a foreign country as a declared area where he or she is satisfied that a listed terrorist organisation is engaging in hostile activity in that area. It would be a defence under subsection (3) for the person to show that they entered or remained in the declared area solely for a legitimate purpose. The legislation provides a list of legitimate purposes, such as providing humanitarian aid, making news reports or making bona fide visits to family members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government is not technically reversing the onus of proof, as the prosecution must still prove the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, the offence is framed in such a way that it has essentially the same effect. Criminal liability will be prima facie established wherever a person enters or remains in a declared area. No other physical elements of the offence are required. The government need not establish, for example, that the person travelled to the area for the purpose of engaging in terrorism or some other illegitimate activity. This is problematic because it is that purpose, rather than the mere fact of travel, which renders the conduct an appropriate subject for criminalisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would establish a new offence that would be made out where a person advocates the doing of a terrorist act or a terrorism offence and is reckless as to whether another person will engage in that conduct as a result. This offence would be punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment. To the extent that the proposed offence encompasses genuine cases of incitementâ€”namely, where a person urges or encourages another person to commit a terrorism act or offence and does so intending that the conduct will occurâ€”it is superfluous. By virtue of section 11.4 of the Criminal Code, it is already an offence to incite a terrorist act or a substantive terrorism offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, section 102.1(2)(b) of the Criminal Code provides that an organisation may be listed by the Governor-General as a terrorist organisation if it advocates the doing of a terrorist act. An organisation advocates terrorism where it directly or indirectly counsels or urges the doing of a terrorist act; or directly or indirectly provides instruction on the doing of a terrorist act; or directly praises the doing of a terrorist act in circumstances where there is a substantial risk that such praise might have the effect of leading a person, regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment that the person might suffer, to engage in a terrorist act. The bill would amend this definition in line with the offence for advocating terrorism so that it also includes the promotion and encouragement of terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 3 of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 currently provides for the admission of evidence received from foreign countries where the Attorney-General makes a formal request for that material, the evidence has been taken on oath or affirmation, and the material purports to be signed or certified by a judge, magistrate or other officer of the foreign country. As noted by the INSLM, such requirements are not practical where the foreign country in question does not have the same levels of government administrationâ€”for example, because the country is in a state of civil war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would overcome these limitations by explicitly allowing foreign material to be adduced in terrorism related proceedings. It would give Australian courts the discretion to exclude that material where it would have a substantial adverse effect on the defendant's right to a fair hearing. Furthermore, the material could not be adduced where the court is satisfied that the information was obtained through torture or duress. The safeguards included in the bill relating to the defendant's right to a fair trial and material obtained through torture or duress are positive inclusions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, section 6 of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978â€”the foreign incursions actâ€”provides a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment where a person enters a foreign state with intent to engage in hostile activity. Hostile activity is defined as including the overthrow of the government, armed hostilities and the unlawful destruction of property belonging to the foreign state. Section 7 provides a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment where a person does any act that is preparatory to that substantive offence. The bill would repeal the foreign incursions act and recreate these offences in the Criminal Code with some amendments. First, it would raise the penalty for both offences to a maximum of life imprisonment. It would also expand the definition of hostile activity to include subverting society. It would encompass serious damage to any property, serious interference with any electronic system or serious harm to any person. The section could apply, for example, to a private dispute between individuals where one person seriously damages another person's house and endangers the person's life in doing so. Such conduct might be criminal, but it should not attract a maximum penalty of life imprisonment under the foreign incursion offences.</span>

The government is not required to provide reasons for its decision to cease the payments where doing so would require them to release security sensitive information.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing I note that changes are being made in passport suspension, emergency visa cancellation and Customs powers, which the Palmer United Party supports. We support this legislation after careful consideration. I end as I began by making the point that the Palmer United Party is very reluctant to support legislation which brings about the lessening of fundamental democratic rights and freedoms for Tasmanians. However, with the recent and unprecedented rise of Islamic extremism, their vile killings, torture and beheadings of innocents, and their declaration of war on Australia and other Western nations, the Palmer United Party is left with no other option but to support this legislation in its entirety.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise to speak in support of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. This is of course the second tranche of the government's national security legislation. This legislation is comprehensive and reflects the extensive work of the Attorney-General and this government to protect Australians. It is important that as a government we do everything we reasonably can to protect our people. That is why we are urgently updating counter-terrorism legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the foreign fighters bill, as it has come to be known, fills the most pressing gaps and will tailor many of our existing powers and offences to address the new threat of home-grown terrorism. It focuses on measures that will have the greatest impact on prevention and disruption of domestic threats. The government has accepted all the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security report on the foreign fighters bill. This legislation has some urgency as it deals with a clear and immediate threat for the safety of Australians. This legislation tackles the escalating threats posed by persons who have participated in foreign conflicts or undertaken training with extremist groups overseas and also by those whom they influence. The government is determined to give our law enforcement, intelligence and border protection agencies the necessary tools to militate against such threats. This bill has a direct impact on their ability to protect the Australian public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It amends 22 acts to respond to the threat posed by Australians engaging in, and returning from, conflicts in foreign states by providing additional powers for security agencies; strengthening border security measures; cancelling welfare payments for persons involved in terrorism; and implementing recommendations made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor's second and fourth annual reports and the report of the Council of Australian Governments review of counterterrorism legislation. The legislation also repeals the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978. I commend the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry into the bill. Their report provided a thorough consideration of the bill and the issues raised in evidence by a wide range of stakeholders. Those stakeholders who participated also made a valuable contribution to those deliberations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have accepted all of the committee's 36 recommendations outlined in its unanimous bipartisan report. Let me repeat: this committee was unanimous in its support and recommendations. The recommendations focused on improving the clarity of provisions in the bill and ensuring that the powers provided for in the bill are used appropriately and subject to proper review. Implementing the recommendations will further strengthen the provisions of the bill including the safeguards, transparency and oversight mechanisms. Most of the recommendations do not suggest amendment to the legislation itself. Importantly, the committee does not recommend against any of the substantive provisions of the bill but makes suggestions largely on definitional and process issues. Now it is time for us in the Senate to add our weight to the committee's recommendation, accept its 37th recommendationâ€”its principal recommendationâ€”and pass the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is the product of a lot of community consultation, of which I have also had the privilege of being part. Unlike most legislation, which is inquired into after tabling by the minister, the Attorney-General took steps to consult about this legislation before tabling. This was an important step, given the sensitivities surrounding the proposed measures and their community impact. I stress that our security measures at home and abroad are directed against terrorism, not against religion and not against any sector of the community. Regrettably, though, it is the Muslim communities that have been affected, given that it is their young people who have been targeted by ISIL, or Daesh. For this reason, it was important to engage in consultations with the Muslim communities regarding aspects of concern about the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having stated what this legislation does, I will correct some misconceptions about this bill. Firstly, it does not target journalists and freedom of the press. Despite the misgivings of a few journalists, they are not the target of these laws, and these provisions are not new to Australian law. This law only relates to special intelligence operations. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services with special responsibility for multicultural affairs and settlement services, I reiterate that this legislation is not intended to target the Muslim communities. I want to reassure these communities that this government appreciates that the actions of a few should not overshadow the valuable contribution that so many in these communities have made to Australia. It is important to reiterate the work that has been done by many people in the Muslim communities in supporting, counselling and, in some cases, stopping disaffected youth from travelling overseas or being caught up in attempts to radicalise them. Much of this work has been done discreetly and quietly, away from the public gaze, by imams, families and community leaders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the most significant risk to Australia's domestic security that we have faced in many years. There is a real risk that foreign fighters returning from abroad not only will become further radicalised but will seek to radicalise others, thereby enhancing the real prospect of terrorist attacks on home soil. I acknowledge the contributions made during the community consultations that the Attorney and I attended and those which I attended on my own. I believe those consultations have assisted in the refining of the legislation before us. Behind the scenes, I have appreciated the advice and counsel of many in the Muslim communities. I particularly acknowledge the women and the youth who have been so forthcoming with their experiences, challenges and advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by talking more generally about what has happened overseas and how it relates to us here in Australia as a free multicultural society. The overwhelming majority of Australians find the barbarism of the terrorist group ISIL, or Daesh, absolutely and utterly abhorrent. One of Australia's greatest strengths is our harmonious, diverse, multicultural, multi-faith community. We need to preserve and protect that. It is critical that at this time all Australians remain tolerant and respect our cultural diversity. To turn on each other on the basis of religion or race would be to play straight into the hands of ISIL, or Daesh, who want to divide us. Freedom of thought, speech and beliefs are important rights in our society and radical thinking can positively transform a country's political and social landscape. However, using violence or supporting its use to achieve ideological, political or social change is not acceptable; this is violent extremism. Australian law enforcement and intelligence agencies are continuing their work to prevent and disrupt any individuals who may be becoming radicalised or who are planning terror in Australia. The Australian government, in consultation with its state and territory counterparts, is taking all necessary steps to keep Australians safe here and overseas. Our counter-terrorism arrangements are well entrenched and they need to remain robust, contemporary and relevant in the current threat environment. As the number of Australians with hands-on terrorist experience is now several times what it was in Afghanistan, the challenge now is that much greater.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude my contribution with some comments on our community engagement and the way forward in dealing with radicalisation. We all know that terrorists and violent extremists represent a small, fringe minority of Australian society. Community leaders have made clear their opposition to the involvement of Australians in Syria and Iraq conflicts and have expressed their abhorrence at the devastating actions of ISIL or Daesh. Let us not forget that many of the innocent people killed or affected by these conflicts are Muslims. The Australian government will continue to do all we can to support community leaders who play a critical role in dissuading young Australians from becoming radicalised and travelling to the conflict zone to fight. Ongoing engagement with communities on the new counter-terrorism measures is a high priority. The government is committed to working with our communities to combat the radicalisation of young Australians and violent extremism. We have consulted with experts and with representatives of the community on the best way to keep our Australian community safe. As part of the recent measures announced by the government we have committed $13.4 million to working with communities on a new program for countering violent extremism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a democracy, Australians are free to express their opinions through peaceful and constructive methods. All Australians are free to choose their religion and should be able to express and practise their religion and their beliefs without intimidation and without interference, as long as those practices are within the framework of Australian law. Individuals and organisations are encouraged to engage with our democratic processes and to make a positive contribution to public debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of our $13.4 million commitment, we are developing a package of measures in consultation with communities to address the particular requirements of young Australians at risk. This may include youth diversion activities, health care, mentoring, employment and educational pathway support and counselling, or potentially a combination of these. There will also be referral and support processes for individuals at risk to help them disengage from their activities. We will also combat online radicalisation with education programs and by working with communities, industry and overseas partners. The intervention framework will provide resources and support services to help communities work with individuals who are radicalised or who are at risk of radicalisation to violent extremism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been involved in community activities for over 30 years, including four years on the board of Father Chris Riley's Youth Off The Streets and two years as its chairman, I have observed firsthand the effectiveness of tailored intervention programs. Young people go off the rails for any number of reasons, and, when they do, they become disenfranchised; they turn to drugs, alcohol, gangs, crime or other activities. In this case, we are seeing the disenfranchisement manifest itself in radicalisation. Accordingly, our assistance to these young people needs to be targeted and needs to be developed and delivered in close collaboration with the communities affected. A key lesson from the previous program is that the most effective and financially beneficial way to progress our efforts in countering violent extremism is to work directly with communities to jointly develop and deliver resources and support services that more effectively target young Australians at risk of radicalisation. This is an important bill at a very critical time in Australia's history.</span>

                    <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I will indicate that I will not be supporting this bill as it stands. I do acknowledge that we face a threat from ISIL, or Daesh, but any response we make to that threat needs to be measured and considered and needs to be effective, not counterproductive. My concern is that the provisions in this bill put in place increased security measures without the equivalent necessary oversight to make sure they are not abused. And I agree with the simple proposition put by Senator John Faulkner that enhanced power requires enhanced accountability. My concern is that there are enhanced powers. Some of these enhanced powers I believe are justified, but not having the framework of enhanced accountability is very dangerous in a democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the contribution Senator Fierravanti-Wells made in this debate. I think she is absolutely right: you need to engage with communities, not alienate themâ€”and I think it is very important that we do not do so. I commend the tireless work Senator Fierravanti-Wells has done in engaging with the Muslim community in Australia in a way that is inclusive, in a way that is welcoming, in a way that I think is the right approach. And I will address that, because the programs to assist in the de-radicalisation of youths are important. But I worry that we need to do more and spend more to get the results that are required, because we are up against an enormous machinery of hate that is trying to brainwash young people, particularly young men, to commit acts of violence against others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put this in perspective in terms of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies. They already have significant powers. More worryingly, we have seen recently an example of an agency misleading the Inspector-General of Intelligence Services, the independent body to which these agencies are supposed to answer for their actions. This intentional misleadingâ€”which relates to an officer of ASIS, the Australian Security and Intelligence Service, allegedly pointing a gun at another government official who happens to be a member of the ADF in Afghanistan while intoxicatedâ€”clearly shows that there is very little respect for the IGIS amongst intelligence services. If you read between the lines, it seems that there was misleadingâ€”arguably intentional misleadingâ€”in respect of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This example of apparently lax oversight and negligible accountability is not what we need if we are going to hand over a new range of powers to our intelligence services. I thank Laura Tingle for her article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review </span>last Friday headed 'Asking the question of who guards the guards'. Ms Tingle made the point that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security had just 13 staff at June last year yet was expected to be the watchdog on the activities of organisations that now employ thousands. ASIO alone had 1,900 staff at June last year. This is not a criticism of IGIS, as such, but it is a criticism of the lack of resources and the lack of powers to ensure accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the debate on the previous national security legislation, I moved a second reading amendment calling on the government to investigate establishing an independent committee to oversee Australia's intelligence services. In the second reading amendment, I pointed to the current examples of similar entities of some of our closest alliesâ€”the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and elsewhere. There is, in the United States, judicial oversight, albeit secret. But there is a court that looks at these matters specifically. There is a parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom which has much more power than our equivalent parliamentary committee. That needs to be looked at very closely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Germany, for instance, the Federal Intelligence Service is the sole foreign intelligence service of the Federal Republic of Germany. As such, it reports directly to the Federal Chancellor. Oversight is as follows: firstly, article 10 of the German Constitution stipulates the privacy of correspondenceâ€”post and telecommunications. Exemptions may be granted only due to specified reasons. The G10 Commission is named after this article. Its monitoring activities consist not only of reviewing ministerial instructions to perform surveillance measures but also of collecting, processing and utilising personal data gathered by the intelligence services using these measures, as well as deciding on whether to inform those affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Article 45d(1) of the German Constitution says that the parliament shall appoint a panel to scrutinise the country's intelligence activities. Therefore, the intelligence agencies regularly submit to the Parliamentary Control Panel comprehensive justifications for their activities and for any matter of particular interest to the legislative branch. The Parliamentary Control Panel can also request additional reports on issues of concern, and employees of the intelligence services may contact the panel directlyâ€”a very, very important safeguard so employees of intelligence services can go directly to this parliamentary oversight panel. Further, the budget of the Federal Intelligence Service is kept secret, but a confidential committee, as part of the parliament's budget committee, is responsible for consulting on this budget and for monitoring expenses. It is comprised of nine members of the budget committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is an additional level of oversight in Germany, in the United States and in the United Kingdomâ€”three of our closest and strongest alliesâ€”where they understand the need to have appropriate oversight. Again, I hark back to what Senator Faulkner said in a very good essay in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> last Friday. He worked from the simple proposition that enhanced power requires enhanced accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, there is a vital need to establish a committee based on the best of the best practices of the United States, of Germany and of the United Kingdom and elsewhereâ€”democracies that understand the threat of terrorism and democracies that actually have a level of judicial and parliamentary oversight that we do not have. The PJCIS, while it does excellent work, has membership limited to the major parties, and it conducts many of its briefings and hearings in secret. I can understand that, but my concern is that it cannot comment on or inquire into operational matters. That does concern me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I understand the need for secrecy measures in some instances, I do believe that we could all benefit from more transparency, openness and accountability. I would also like to endorse Senator Faulkner's comments from earlier in this debate. He called for a comprehensive review of the oversight of Australia's intelligence agencies and recommended to the Senate proposals that have already been made by other organisations. We must act on these as a matter of urgency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to remember that the changes proposed in this bill will not take place in a vacuum. That is why Senator Fierravanti-Wells' contribution was so importantâ€”about the need to engage with Muslim communities. This must not be seen as targeting a specific group, a specific religion, or people of specific ethnicities. It ought to be about targeting behaviour that is dangerous to Australia. The environment in this country can sometimes border on the febrile, and I think that we must act in a way so thatâ€”and I think Senator Fierravanti-Wells has been consulting, along with the Attorney-General, with communities around the countryâ€”we can diffuse those aspects of this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like the quote from the human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC, during his appearance on the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> last night. Robertson said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has more anti-terrorism laws than any other country in the world. We've had 62 terrorism laws since 9/11. We don't need more. What our laws don't have are two things. The first, they don't have independent oversight. We don't have impartial judges giving orders and directing and approving warrants. It's entirely done within the intelligence establishment. But, secondly, and I think this is the important thing about the question, we donâ€™t have, because law can't solve the problem of terrorism, we have to turn to community service. We have to turn to anti-jihadi organisations, de-radicalisation programs and this seems what Australia doesn't have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He continued speaking of deradicalisation programs run in Britain:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But there is a de-radicalisation program that anyone who is - passport is cancelled is immediately put on. It involves, not only police, but the local imams, parents, social workers, psychologists, even a couple of returned jihadis are part of that program and I think this is what Australia is lacking at the moment - a proper de-radicalisation program that plugs into those who are identified as being vulnerable and on the - in danger of being lured overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what Senator Fierravanti-Wells outlinedâ€”some $13 million spent by the government in terms of deradicalisation programsâ€”is a good thing. That is welcome. I wonder whether we need to spend more. I believe that we do need to throw everything at this considering that we will be spending half a billion dollars in terms of the latest campaign in Iraq and in Syria in respect of combating the threat of ISILâ€”the real existential threat of ISIL. We need to look at that as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to learn from the lessons of the past. We were part of the coalition of the willing back in 2003 when Saddam Hussein was toppled in Iraq. We all agree that Saddam Hussein was a dictator who was responsible for massive human rights abuses. But when I speak to people who come from Iraq and who despised Saddam Hussein, they say that, as a result of the American intervention of which we were part of, matters got much worse. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed in the sectarian violence that broke out. We need to learn very, very carefully from the recent lessons of history when it comes to what we do and how we do it to combat what is, clearly, a threat in the region and further abroad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government wants to put in place incredibly broad lawsâ€”ones that have raised specific human rights concernsâ€”to address the specific problem of so-called home-grown terrorists. I want to make this clear so that it is not misunderstood by anyone: I believe there is merit in some of the proposals the government is putting up. I think there ought to be a reverse onus of proof in relation to someone being in a designated area then coming back to Australia. I think that it is very important that we make clear that you have to have a very good reason for being thereâ€”humanitarian purposes, you are there is a journalist reporting on the conflict zone. Anyone who spends six or 12 months in one of these designated areas ought to have a very good reason for doing so, and it is important that that is a watertight provision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the previous bill, which I also opposed, I also want to make it clear that I did support the Palmer United Party's amendment to increase the penalty for someone disclosing the identity of an ASIO agent working in a covert operation or someone working with ASIO who may have been supplying them with information. If you identify someone in the middle of a covert operation, that could well be a death sentence for that person. So it is appropriate to have a maximum penalty of 10 years. My concern in respect of the previous piece of legislationâ€”as it is with thisâ€”is that we have a situation where I believe the press is being unnecessarily muzzled, and I will address that briefly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we also need to have a much greater emphasisâ€”alluded to by Senator Fierravanti-Wellsâ€”in engaging with communities that are vulnerable to infiltration from terrorist groups. I think that you cannot sow hate and expect to reap love further down the track. You need to make it very clearâ€”as I believe the government has begun to do with its deradicalisation program and its method of engagementâ€”that we need to change the tone of our public discourse from exclusion to inclusion. We need to reach out, not pull away, and we need to build allegiances, not walls. So these are some of the crucial matters that we must address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is the view of the government and the opposition that we need these laws in place, I believe that there are some measures that are justified. But without that additional oversight and accountability and scrutiny, these laws ought not to be passed. We must have that appropriate oversight. I have spoken before about my concerns, in national security terms, regarding the new offence outlined in section 35B of the recent legislation that was passed. This was the amendment that outlined the offence of disclosing information relating to a special intelligence operation. Media outlets have quite rightly been very concerned about this. I am very concerned about the impact this new offence will have on journalists' ability and willingness to report stories covering special intelligence operations. We must not forgetâ€”we must never forgetâ€”that the media plays a vital role in our democracy. Appropriate oversight by the media ensures that the public remains informed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendments to this section of the previous bill were rejected in the Senate, and I am working now on further amendments to ensure that there is a public interest defence. I would urge when those amendments are drafted and prepared next week for the third tranche of national security legislation that they are looked at very closely by the government and the opposition because there has to be a bipartisan consensus in respect of this. For instance, in relation to section 119.7 subsection 3 of this bill, which relates to the offence of publishing recruiting information in Australia, one journalist has raised with me concerns about how that would be applied and whether that could be misapplied in a way that would muzzle journalists from reporting how terrorist organisations operateâ€”even if they were not reporting in a way to encourage people joining those terrorist organisations but to warn of the sinister recruiting techniques. There are real concerns in respect of that. There must be a public interest defence for journalists. It is very important in our democracy that we have this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, News Corp group co-chairman, Lachlan Murdoch, delivered the Keith Murdoch Oration at the state library of Victoria. In it he muses whether his grandfather Keith Murdoch's famous letter to then Prime Minister Fisher about the disastrous Gallipoli campaign would have landed him in jail if it had occurred today. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ our Government is introducing legislation that includes jailing journalists for up to 10 years if they disclose information that relates to a "special intelligence operation".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of course, it is left ambiguous what a "special intelligence operation" is, as it is left up to government agencies to decide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lachlan Murdoch poses a very pertinent question. Would the Gallipoli campaign have been a special operation, he asks. Would Keith Murdoch have been arrested with Ashmead-Bartlett's letter and spent the next 10 years in jail? As Lachlan Murdoch rightly identified, his grandfather's letter was a declaration that our nation had a right to know the truth. He also pointed out this year's Freedom House annual index of media freedom found that global press freedom has fallen to its lowest level in more than 10 years. Twenty years ago, Australia was listed ninth on the index. Today we are 33rd, just behind Belize. We cannot afford to limit these freedoms any further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot support this bill as it stands for a number of reasons. The overarching reason is that, with these increased powers, we do not have increased levels of accountability for our intelligence agencies and increased levels of scrutiny and checks and balances on our freedoms. For me, it is a limitation on human rights and on the freedom of the press which only emphasises the idea that we can sacrifice anything in pursuit of national security. Without proper oversight and limitations I cannot support this bill. I call on the government and the opposition to address these concerns as a matter of urgency, particularly in respect of section 35P which I see as interrelated in respect of this. I look forward to debating these make matters in the committee stage. I will, of course, consider every amendment on its merits. These are matters which we must deal with sooner rather than later because if we do not ask the question of who guards the guards then our democracy is the lesser for it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">May I say that Senator Faulknerâ€”and, Senator Xenophon, you mentioned this in your contributionâ€”published last Friday, through the Lowy Institute for International Policy, a very thoughtful paper on this area of policy, extracts of which were published in Friday's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review. </span>The approach which the government, with the support of the opposition, has taken to the preparation of this bill reflects the attitude and approach outlined by Senator Faulkner in that paper, which, if I may summarise it, is the approach of saying: we do, in this dangerous time, need to give the law enforcement and national security agencies strong powers but we also need to balance those strong powers with strong safeguards and strong oversight mechanisms. I believe that this legislation achieves both of those objectives and meets both of those criteria. And the fact that the opposition have decided to support this bill reflects the fact that they are of the same view. Both sides of politics accept that the right balance between necessary powers and appropriate safeguards has been achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, one of the recommendations of the PJCIS, which the government has accepted, is that that committee, rather than the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, should have oversight over the Australian Federal Police's counter-terrorism function. That is new in our system of parliamentary oversight and it will mean that the PJCIS will have complete visibility of the terrorism environment and the counter-terrorism efforts of all relevant Australian authorities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of senators in their contributions expressed confusion about the nature of the security threats that we all face and therefore the necessity of the legislation. I might say, in particular, that confusion was evident from contributions made by senators from the Greens party. It is not surprising that senators from the Greens party misunderstand, underestimate and naively disregard the significance of the threats that Australians face. I suspect that the specialists in this field and the good men and women who staff Australia's law enforcement and national security agencies, in particular ASIO, are in a better position to make an informed and mature judgement about that matter than the Greens party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Attorney-General, I have accessed daily intelligence reports that over recent weeks and months have pointed to an increasingly concerning picture. The government has attempted to be transparent but measured in sharing this picture with the entire Australian community. We operate in this chamber in a political environment, but there are many respects in which this debate transcends politics and that is why, more frequently than is customary, the government has decided to ask not ministersâ€”I have chosen not myself as the Attorneyâ€”but, rather, people who are not political at all, the Director-General of ASIO, first Mr Irvine and now Mr Lewis, and also the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Commissioner Colvin, to explain to the Australian people in a measured, judicious, informed and professionally expert way their assessment of the terrorist threat. These people are not politicians. Politicians are sometimes accusedâ€”and sometimes, I am sorry to say, correctly accusedâ€”of rhetorical exuberance, but not the Director-General of ASIO, not the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. They serve no political masters. The views that the government expresses in this debate are not political views; they are the views of people like Mr Irvine, Mr Lewis and Commissioner Colvin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I hope unites all of us in this chamber is a belief that our first priority as a government is to ensure the safety and security of our citizens and, by securing that, ensuring the safety and security of our liberal democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 12 September, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the Prime Minister announced that, based on an assessment by the security and intelligence agencies, the government had raised the national terrorism public alert level from medium to high. Raising the national terrorism public alert level was to ensure that Australians were aware of the increased likelihood of a terrorist attack occurring in Australia and that they remained vigilant. Of course, articulating the nature of the threat is a role not confined to government. On an almost daily basis the media is reporting about the activities of Australians and other nationals in Syria and northern Iraq, activities that are horrifying and abhorrent to all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who take a naive and insouciant view of the nature of the terrorism threat evidently regard what is plain for all to see in our media, as well as what has been emphatically warned of by our national security experts, as unreliable or unworthy of being taken seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I may say to senators of the Greens party, who will never have the burden and responsibility of government: it is the burden and responsibility of government to take seriously matters that they treat flippantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are increasingly witnessing the activities of people who have returned to their home countries from the conflict zones or who have been prevented from travelling and have turned their ambitions on their home countries. That is a problem that Australia suffers, along with other western democracies. Make no mistake: returning and frustrated foreign fighters represent a threat to us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Â </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Up to this point, domestic counterterrorism investigations have mainly concentrated on local actors who have shown the intent to act on Australian soil but lacked or required time to develop the necessary capability. The Syria and Iraq conflicts have changed the terrorist threat environment, providing a significant opportunity for Australians to travel overseas and develop the necessary capability to undertake terrorist attacks. In addition to that capability, operational agencies are concerned that Australian foreign fighters will return further radicalised and hardened by their experiences fighting overseas. There is a wealth of intelligence product that indicates that is so. To that end we must prevent the creation of a cadre of Australians willing and able to engage in terrorism in Australia, to recruit others to travel overseas and engage in hostile activities and to raise funds for terrorist organisations. This bill provides important measures that will enhance the capability of Australia's law enforcement, intelligence and border protection agencies to protect Australia from the threat posed by returning foreign fighters and those individuals within Australia supporting them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the introduction of the bill, on 24 September 2014, I referred it to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. That committee conducted hearings under the chairmanship of Mr Dan Tehan, the member for Wannon. I want to take this opportunity to thank all members of that committee and in particular the chair, and the deputy chair, Mr Anthony Byrne, from the Labor Party, for the hard work they put into that task and the very conscientious and thoroughgoing way in which they acquitted it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee made 37 recommendations, concluding in a recommendation that the bill be passed. The report was tabled out of sittings on 17 October last. It recommended a number of amendments that will improve the clarity of the provisions of the bill and ensure the powers provided for in the bill are used appropriately and subject to proper review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I announced on 22 October, the government has decided to accept all of the amendments, and I will shortly move amendments to give effect to them. In addition, the government will table a replacement explanatory memorandum consistent with the recommendations of the PJCIS that further elaborate on the justification for various of the measures in the bill. In particular, the government has responded to recommendation No. 4 by amending the explanatory memorandum to clarify that it is open to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to have regard to any public interest in the disclosure of information when considering whether to initiate a prosecution from a disclosure of information in relation to a delayed notification search warrant. I can inform honourable senators that I have written to the Commonwealth DPP to confirm that instruction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's response to PJCIS recommendation No. 31 advised that I should provide to the parliament a further explanation of the necessity of the proposed definition of 'serious Commonwealth offence', for the purposes of the Customs Act, and how it would enable a greater role of Customs in dealing with national security threats or terrorist activities. Let me now do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current definition of 'serious Commonwealth offence' is limited to types of offences listed in section 15GE of the Crimes Act, and to those offences that carry a maximum penalty of three years. The proposed definition of 'serious Commonwealth offence', which would capture offences that carry a maximum penalty of 12 months, is required to enable the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to effectively deal with national security threats and terrorist activity, as well as enhancing its capacity to respond to broader criminal activity. Examples of offences that currently would not be captured are: where a person travels on a false passport, which is prohibited by sections 31 and 32 of the Australian Passports Act; where a person fails to report movements of physical currency or bearer negotiable instruments, in contravention of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act; and where a person imports, introduces or brings into a port or other place in Australia a disease, pest or substance containing a disease or pest, in contravention of the Quarantine Act. This is particularly sensitive at the current time, considering the threat posed by diseases such as Ebola. As the first point of our border security, it is appropriate for the ACBPS to be able to investigate suspected criminal activity, to ensure the integrity of our borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the government supports PJCIS recommendation No. 8, for that committee to be notified of any proposed regulation to alter the listing of a terrorist organisation by adding or removing a name or alias, and allow the PJCIS to review any proposed change during the disallowable period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to take the opportunity of closing the second reading debate to clarify a reference in the government's response to PJCIS recommendations 13 and 21, which deal with the dates for the various provisions to sunset. The PJCIS recommended sunset and statutory reviews occur within set periods from the date of the next federal election, having regard to the need for certainty when providing a sunset for extraordinary powers. The government has opted to sunset the provisions two years after the third anniversary of the 2013 federal electionâ€”the government believes this gives effect to the PJCIS recommendation, while providing certainty regarding the duration of these powersâ€”so that the actual date on which the sunset will occur is specified in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that a number of honourable senators have expressed their support for the implementation of the committee's recommendations. We look forward to working constructively with members of this chamber on the relevant amendments to the bill in committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Might I conclude by observing that as with the first tranche of national security legislationâ€”the National Security Legislation Amendment Billâ€”so too this bill is a fine example of the parliamentary process working as it ought to work. The government sent this bill, as it sent the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill, to the relevant joint committee of the parliament, a committee that, if I may so say, comprises many of the most senior statesmen from both sides of parliament. That committee had a very close look at the legislation. It proposed recommendations which, in every respect, if I may say so, were constructive. Although in many respects they were matters of relatively slight degree, they were nevertheless constructive. The government, in a spirit of cooperation, accepted all the recommendations on this occasion, as we accepted the recommendations last time. That, as I say, is the way parliament is meant to work: there is a dialogue, a dialectical process, between the executive government and the parliamentâ€”particularly the more serious-minded members of parliament, speaking through the committee system. So once again I want to thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for its work. I also want to thank a number of individual crossbench senators who have been good enough to speak to me about certain provisions of this legislation. These include Senator Lazarus, Senator Lambie, Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Day and Senator Xenophon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The work in which we are engaged tonight is the work of patriots. It is the work of both sides of this parliament addressing in a timely but considered, methodical, purposeful and calm way an immediate threat to the safety of our nation, by a process of fine tuning proposals, at the executive government level, at the parliamentary levelâ€”in particular, through the committee systemâ€”to ensure that the right balance between security and freedom is maintained. I thank all honourable senators. I should also go out of my way to thank my opposite number from the Labor Party, the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, with whom I have had meetings and with whom my officers had many meetings concerning this legislation, for his very greatly appreciated contribution to the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, I think, landed where we ought to land in dealing with this problem. The recommendations of the PJCIS which require amendment to the bill, I will move momentarily as we proceed into the committee stage. Those that require further explanation through the explanatory memorandum have been addressed through the latest iteration of the explanatory memorandum, and those which required explanation by way of comment from government I have sought to address in these second reading remarks. On that note, let me close the second reading debate, and thank all of those colleagues in this place and in the other place who have made a constructive contribution to the process.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:09</span>):  The Australian Greens indicate that these proposed amendments from the government are positive steps forward in limiting how powers can be delegated and putting some outer limits on how long a security assessment can remain in force, but they certainly do not go as far as the Australian Greens' proposed amendments. Again, I will be dealing with those when we come to them on the running sheet.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The particular concern that we have in relation to the suspension of Australian passports is that the bill seeks to supplement existing travel document cancellation powers by empowering the minister to suspend Australian and foreign travel documents for 14 days at the request of an ASIO officer where that officer believes on reasonable grounds that the person may leave Australia to engage in conduct that might prejudice the security of Australia or a foreign country and suspension of travel documents is necessary to prevent the person from engaging in the conduct. While the Australian Greens accept that a range of experts, including the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, have agreed that this provision is needed to fill a genuine legislative gap, we are concerned about the way that the new power has been drafted. We have concerns that the proposed new power does not fully conform to the relevant recommendations of the INSLM, which specifically recommended an initial suspension period of 48 hours which could be extended by further suspensions of up to 48 hours at a time for a maximum period of seven days. We believe that the bill, even with the amendment, would still contain insufficient safeguards to prevent ongoing multiple suspensions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated before, there are some concerns about the bill and, indeed, even with the amendments that have just been passed with the bill. These concerns have led the Australian Greens to recommend that the new powers be amended to provide for an initial suspension period of a maximum of 48 hours, which could be extended by further suspensions of up to 48 hours at a time for a maximum period of seven days; to remove the power for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to delegate his or her passport suspension powers; and to make it clear that a request to suspend a travel document must be made by an individual ASIO officer, so as to ensure appropriate oversight of relevant processes by the inspector-general. The expert advice which we have relied upon in supporting the position that we have brought, in terms of moving these amendments, are recommendations that have been made previously by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Law Council of Australia, the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law and the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to address a question to the Attorney-General in relation to the effects of the bill. The proposed new powers to suspend travel documents have the potential to seriously disrupt people's lives, particularly those who need to travel as a matter of urgencyâ€”for example, to visit a dying relative or to secure a business deal. My question is: will there be redress for those who have their travel document suspended under these powers, but are later found not to be a risk to Australia's national security, as the bill does not currently provide for that possibility occurring?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:18</span>):  These amendments proposed by the Greens would limit the power for an interim suspension of a passport to only 48 hours, as Senator Wright has indicated. They would be able to be extended for additional periods of 48 hours, but no longer than one week. The committee agreed that the interim suspension power was an important and key issue and that the need to improve powers to suspend powers was flagged by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor last year.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes the best action we can take to address foreign fighters is to stop Australian citizens ever going to fight, not only because of the damage they may do overseas but also because we know the skills and mindset they may return to Australia with. It is for these reasons that we think these powers need to be improved and we will be opposing amendment (4). With respect to amendments (5) to (8), these would alter the passport suspension process. The same points apply in part to what I have indicated in relation to amendment (4), but we note that these are important concerns being raised by the Greens.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, however, satisfied by the amendments reflected in the Intelligence Committee's recommendations and it is important to mention that those amendments include review of the passport suspension provisions. There is an important opportunity now to highlight, as I did in my second reading contribution, the important progress that has been made in relation to sunset clauses and review in the Intelligence Committee's recommendation. We will be opposing these Greens' amendments as well.</span>

These amendments will all be opposed. The government opposes Greens' amendment (4) because, although the amendment would, as Senator Wright has said, implement the time period suggested by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, what she omitted to say is that the INSLM also noted in his report that his suggested time frames were 'somewhat  arbitrary' and should be 'the subject of further discussion'â€”his words, not mine.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After further discussions with agencies, it was concluded that an initial suspension period of 48 hours, up to a maximum of seven days, would be too short to give practical effect to the suspension power. In its report on the bill, the PJCIS considered that the 14-day suspension period appropriately balances the need to allow sufficient time for ASIO to conduct a full assessment of the person with the impacts on the individual passport holder concerned. The government also opposes amendments (5) and (6) among the Greens' amendments. Those amendments would allow an officer of ASIO to make a request for the suspension of a person's Australian travel documents. They are not necessary, as government amendments to the bill implementing PJCIS recommendation 26, with which we have dealt, will limit the requesting authority for the suspension of a person's Australian travel documents to the Director-General of Security. The Director-General may delegate this power to a Deputy Director-General of Security. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might say, in passing, that it rather surprises me, given the overall position that the Greens party has taken in relation to this bill, that they would allow for a much wider delegation of powerâ€”as their amendments contemplateâ€”than the much narrower and more heavily safeguarded provisions of the government's amendments, which confine the requesting authority to the Director-General of Security or to one of the Deputy Directors-General of Security. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also opposes Greens amendment (7), which will allow an officer of ASIO to apply for an extension of the suspension of a person's Australian travel document, for the same reasons as our opposition to amendments (5) and (6). The government opposes amendment (8), which is consequential upon proposed amendments (5) and (6). </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  First of all, in relation to the point that the Attorney-General made about the fact that the government's amendments nowâ€”very late in the piece, and only recently circulatedâ€”propose an amendment to allow the Director-General of Security to be the person to whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs may delegate his or her passport suspension power, in its first iteration of the bill, which is what we had notice of until late today, it was to any person. That obviously caused great concern. Because it would have allowed the Minister for Foreign Affairs to delegate the power to an officer of ASIO, ASIO could be a law unto itself. In fact, that could still be the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it has been misleading all along for the government to suggest in its explanatory memorandum, and to continue to suggest, that this provision of the bill actually implements the recommendations of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. Even if the time frames that the monitor initially proposed were, as asserted, somewhat arbitrary, the concern that the Australian Greens have now is that this proposal means that there could be multiple suspensions. There is no real limit on how many times the suspension period can be repeated, and there are insufficient safeguards to prevent that from occurring. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the Australian Greens say that while some additional powers are needed there is great concern that this new power could be misused, overused or subject to inadequate oversight. That will essentially leave the Australian community at risk of having their legitimate, and possibly urgent, overseas travel unnecessarily or disproportionately disrupted. While the Attorney-General seeks to reassure me, as is the case in relation to quite a few of the provisions in this bill, that they will only be exercised rarely and seriously, there is a large amount of discretion. That is not reassuring. That does not provide the certainty that people need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I took from the Attorney-General's response to my first question was that there will be no provision for any compensation made where, even if the decisions are made rarely and seriously, there is a mistake made. Sometimes, we know, mistakes can be made and if a person's life or travel is disrupted to their detriment there will be no compensation. Unless the Attorney-General suggests that that is not the case, then clearly that is the position that will come about if this amendment is passed.</span>

But, more importantly, the government announced its decision to accept the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security last Wednesday. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the PJCIS recommended setting the sunset at two years after the last federal election that would result in uncertainty about the period of operation of these important powers. Accordingly, a date that would meet the intent of the recommendation but provide certainty was selected. That date, 7 September 2018, is two years after the third anniversary of the last general electionâ€”that is, the general election prior to 2018. So the two-year period is kept, but a date has been selected that enables that period of two years to be reflected in the date most approximately likely to be the actual date of the two-year anniversary. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the sunset could have been set as late as 14 January 2019, because that is two years after the very last date on which parliament could be dissolved, being the three-year anniversary of the first meeting of the House of Representatives after the previous election, the earlier date is more consistent with the intent of reduced sunset periods, more content with the spirit of the PJCIS report and means, as I said, Senator Wright, that the sunset provision will likely take effect sooner rather than later.</span>

These serve to extend control orders, preventative detention orders and other powers. The former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor recommended that control orders and preventative detention orders be abolished. The government is now seeking to extend the sunset provisions for these powers when the current sunset provisions still have at least a year before they expire. I am interested in understanding: did past independent expert inquiries by the monitor and, in fact, the COAG review of national security legislation get it wrong when they recommended that the preventative detention order regime be removed and that the control order regime be reformed?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:31</span>):  Senator Wright, I am aware of the view that preventative detention orders and control orders ought to be repealed. That was a view of the previous INSLM. It is not a universal view, nor was the INSLM's review the only review of these powers. The report of the COAG review, for instance, Senator Wright, with which perhaps you are familiar, recommended that control orders be continued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might say that the recommendation that the government has adopted, coming from the PJCIS, brings forward the sunset period by many years beyond what was initially contemplated. It was initially contemplated that the sunset period be extended by another decade. The original sunset period, after the Howard government introduced these provisions in 2005, was for them to sunset after a decade. When this legislation was prepared, a view was taken by the government, consistently with are COAG review, that control orders ought to remain a part of the apparatus available to the intelligence agencies. The utility of control orders is something that has been demonstrated, but they have been used sparingly in only the most extreme cases. There have only been two control orders sought and obtained in that decade: one in relation to David Hicks and the other in relation to Jack Thomas, both notorious terrorists, or, in Mr Hicks's case, an admitted terrorism supporter who trained with terrorist organisations in Afghanistan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the rather exuberant and in some cases hysterical language in 2005, that these control orders might be used oppressively, was proven to have been a false concern. They have been used rarely, selectively and, indeed, on only two occasions in the decade since. So, when the government considered the matter, the question we had to ask ourselves is: would we follow the view of one INSLM or would we follow the view of the COAG review? We decided to follow the view of the COAG review and keep control orders as part of our apparatus. But, in deference to the views of the members of the PJCIS, we have brought the period of the control orders back from a further decade to a date two years after the date of the next federal election, so they will sunset then and can be reviewed on that occasion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to preventative detention orders, that is also a very rare thing. There has never been a preventative detention order issued under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. There was recently a preventative detention order issued under the analogous or the complementary provisions of the New South Wales criminal law, which I understand is the first occasion on which that device has been resorted to. So, once again, the suggestion that these mechanisms might be used oppressively has not been realised. I note it was before you were in the Senate, Senator, so I do not blame you for this sentiment, but the fears of those who thought that this extraordinary power would be use gratuitously or arbitrarily have not been realised. The fact that on very rare occasions the authorities have felt the need to resort to them demonstrates their utility as a last resort in our apparatus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a further token of our concern to ensure that powers as unusual as this are not used excessively or arbitrarily or allowed to lie on the statute books unnecessarily, we have, as I said, foreshortened the extended sunset period from a decade hence to two years after the next federal election.</span>

The mischief, the threat, that this legislation primarily concerns and seeks to addressâ€”the threat of foreign fightersâ€”is, I am very sorry to say, not a threat that is likely to disappear any time soon. Senator, you do not have to be privy to the intelligence to understand that. You merely have to look at the assessment in some of the quality commentary on this issue and some of the quality open source media to know that this is a problem that those who profess to be specialists in this field predict will be with us for some years yet. Given that the view was taken that the threat is likely to be with us for some years yet, the government decided that an appropriate thing was to replicate the initial sunset period, to roll it forward, but still leave a sunset mechanism in place. However, as I say, in deference to the views of the PJCIS, we have foreshortened that in the manner I have indicated.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:37</span>):  It seems somewhat ironic that the government of its own idea and thinkingâ€”not with recourse to any recommendations from any of the other bodies that you have been citing in relation to justifying the continuation of the regimesâ€”came up with 10 years, and you are suggesting that it is a virtue that you have been prepared to wind it back to four years on the recommendation of PJCIS. You are preferring to take the recommendation of that body as opposed to following, as you said, the recommendations of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. I put to you that not only COAG and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor have expressed concerns about this regime and, indeed, the time frame; a very strong view has been put out there by organisations that I will cite in a minute that it is completely unnecessary and inappropriate to use this particular billâ€”which we are told it is an urgent matter to get through the parliament. That has therefore led to a lot of concerns about the speed with which it has been analysed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is complex legislation, and a lot of people who made submissions to the PJCIS said that they had limited time. Some people said that they did not have enough time to analyse the consequences of this legislation properly. Nonetheless, the justification by the government is that this is an urgent matter that has to be got to straightaway; yet we know that there was at least a year to allow some more careful and slower reflection on the consequences of extending the sunset provisions in relation to the PDOs, the control orders and the other powers. So there is a view that it is completely unnecessary and inappropriate to use this bill to extend the sunset clauses attached to powers like control orders, preventative detention orders and ASIO's questioning and detention warrant powers, because they would have remained in place for at least another year regardless of the passage of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are exceptional powers that allow authorities to operate outside the traditional criminal justice process. They permit the restriction of liberty of people who have not been charged withâ€”and, in some cases, are not even suspected of engaging inâ€”a criminal offence. Under these powers, a mother or a father or a teenager could be detained and questioned by ASIO or the police and provided only limited access to loved ones and legal representation without the authorities needing to charge the person with any criminal offence or establish that the person is a threat to national security. As you point out, they have only been used very rarely in the past, but that is one of the concerns that has been reflected in some of the commentary around the necessity to maintain these very, very restrictive regimes, because having excessive and restrictive laws on the books for which there is not a clear need is dangerous in itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These powers have been subject to review, as we have said. Both the COAG review of counterterrorism measures and the INSLM considered whether these powers remain necessary and effective tools to counter terrorism. They had regard to whether and when they had been used and to information provided by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Both the INSLM and the COAG review recommended that the preventative detention order regime be repealed, describing the PDO regime as being 'at odds with our normal approach to even the most reprehensible crimes' and may be thought to be unacceptable in a liberal democracy. The INSLM also recommended substantial reform to the control order regime. Similar comments were previously made by the former Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD in an earlier inquiry about ASIO's questioning and detention powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many concerns on the record about these regimes. There are concerns about the unnecessary extension of the sunset clauses not from 10 yearsâ€”which is what the government was initially proposingâ€”but even to four years, when there was time to consider these in a more careful and thoughtful way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a fairly easy argument to makeâ€”it is a fairly flippant thing to accuse someone who is disagreeing with your stance of being naive in some way. The Australian Greens have been at pains to consult carefully with those in this area that are considered to be experts in the consequences of changes to laws on human rights and civil liberties in Australia. We are aware of advice from organisations in relation to these regimes including the INSLM; the COAG Counter-terrorism Review Committee; the Gilbert and Tobin Centre of Public Law; Human Rights Watch; acknowledged human rights academic Professor Ben Saul; the Human Rights Law Centre; the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law; and, of course, the PJCIS, which, when it had a short time frame to consider this legislation, also had a view about the government's proposed time period. For those reasons, the Australian Greens say that we need to remove these clauses from the bill and take some time and carefully assess whether these are needed and for what period of time they should be on the books before they are reviewed again.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:43</span>):  Senator Wright, I do not for a moment dispute that there are a variety of views on this matter, and all you have done is recite the views of some who have been well-known advocates of that particular point of view for a very long time. I suspect that the sorts of bodies or individuals to whom you have referred because of the particular approach they take to this debate would never be happy with any extension of the powers of the national security agencies. They are entitled to take that view, but the government has to do what human rights lawyers and academic lawyers like Professor Saul never have to doâ€”that is, consider as well the safety of the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures are extraordinary measures. That is why they are sunsetted. That is why the government is of the view that, from time to time, we ought to ask ourselves the question as a result of the mechanism of this legislation whether they are still needed. The time arose this year for us to ask ourselves that question. And in view of the events which I will not be tedious and describe again but of which we all know, the government concluded that those powers were necessaryâ€”indeed I dare say more necessary now than they were in 2005.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, really all we are doing is having a discussion about whether four years or 10 years is the right period, and the government has acknowledged that it would do no harm at all to bring these powers back for review again four years hence, which is why I am moving this amendment. It seems to me, Senator, that when you say that the powers are very seldom used you go very close to complaining that what is wrong with the powers is that they are used too seldom. My rejoinder to you is that the fact that the powers are used so seldom shows that they have not been used arbitrarily. The fact that on rare occasions they have been used is proof enough, I think, that they do have a utility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some who would like to see these powers not sunsetted at all. There are some who consider them a sufficiently important apparatus that they should be a permanent feature of our law. I am not one of those. Because these are unusual powers, they should, in my view, be sunsetted, and that is what the government is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, Senator, let me address your criticism that because the sunset period in this case does not run out until 2015 the powers ought not to have been included in this piece of legislation but in another piece of legislation. I see some merit in your point of view, but there are two problems with it. First of all, it assumes that there has not been careful deliberation about the validity and utility of extending these powers in preparing this legislation. I can assure you that the same care and deliberation and prudence that would have been brought to bear on this exercise had it been undertaken in 2015 has been brought to bear on the exercise having been undertaken in 2014. Secondly, Senator Wright, I am sure you will see the point of dealing with these national security legislation issues in a comprehensive way. We have already had one tranche of legislation about the agency powers. This tranche of legislation is designed particularly to deal with the threat to our safety of returning foreign fighters. And there will be, as the government has announced, legislation in the near future concerning the mandatory retention of metadata.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a healthy thing for the parliament to spend all its time dealing with national security legislation. We want to get this right by dealing with all of the various aspects of this complex body of legislation in a coherent debate that brings all the elements together as well as we may, in the same debate or the same series of debates, rather than doing it piecemeal.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:48</span>):  Thank you, Attorney-General. I do not really understand the logic of that. You say that you want to have everything dealt with together and you want to get it right. And I suppose the argument is that in fact you cannot necessarily do both at the same time. They are inconsistent, given that there is significant concern about the speed with which this complex legislation is being rushed through the parliament, where, on my calculation, given the gag orderâ€”the guillotine order that has now been passed by this Senate through the agreement of the government and the oppositionâ€”we will have less than eight hours to consider what are some of the most significant counter-terrorism law changes that I will witness in my lifetime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the idea that you can do it all nicely and neatly together quickly and get it right is what I would be contesting there. My question is: if Australia's national security environment has changed to such a significant degree, why isn't the remaining 12 months left on the current life span of these regimes being used to evaluate their effectiveness in light of the changed environment? They will still be in place. There would be time to seriously look at the concerns that have been raised previously. And the observation that they have rarely been used is actually an observation that has been made by the INSLM in the past to query the wisdom of keeping extremely extensive and intrusive laws on the books when there does not appear to be a legitimate need for those to be there.</span>

I was first asked by the National Security Committee of cabinet to develop these proposals in the middle of the year. It is now 28 October. I do not know what you mean by doing something very quickly, Senator Wright, but I am bound to say that in the time that has been available in the last several months there has been more than sufficient time for me and for those who advise me within the Attorney-General's Department and within ASIO and the national security agencies and for my own staff to look with great care and deliberation at these proposals. What we bring to the parliament is the result of an enormous body of work that has been undertaken in a very thorough and calm and professional and methodical way. So, the suggestion that this has been done quickly, with respect, is not right.</span>

Because of the way in which these powers have been expressed in the actâ€”and this is a continuation, with some refinements, of course, of powers that were first legislated in 2005â€”it is obvious, to anyone who is capable of reading the act, the way in which the capacity to obtain a control order or a preventive detention order, the tests that must be satisfied, the caveats and the red lines, as it were, in the legislation which prevent the obtaining of orders of this kind except in very unusual circumstances, are actually written into the law. So this is not a matter of executive discretion, Senator Wright. You have read the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, I am sure, so you would have seen for yourself how many safeguards are built in, how high the thresholds are, how limited the circumstances are in which orders of this kind are obtained, how rigorous the accountability mechanisms areâ€”in particular, the need to go back to the issuing officer in a very short span of timeâ€”and the limitations on the renewal of orders of this kind, and so forth. I suppose, therefore, the immediate answer to your question is: it is there for you to see in the act for yourself.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, let me take the opportunity of your question, Senator Wright, to remind you, or to acquaint you with the fact that the government has taken an enormous amount of time and effort to meet with community groups most immediately affected. These groups are not directed at any particular community; they are laws of general application. But it is a sad fact, as we all know, that at the moment the threat of foreign fighters is inspired by those young men and women who are ensnared by ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusra and other organisations, and that, in the name of the Islamic faithâ€”although it is a claim that the mainstream of practitioners of the Islamic faith, of course, utterly rejectâ€”are encouraged to go to Iraq and Syria to fight in wars being conducted by ISIL. ISIL is a barbaric death cult which is at war with a Muslim nationâ€”the nation of Iraq.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I and my colleague Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, who has particular portfolio responsibility for multicultural affairs, have had many meetingsâ€”some of which the Prime Minister has participated in himselfâ€”with leaders of the Islamic community. At those meetings, I have engaged in very frank discussions with the leaders of that community in the preparation of this bill. I have said to them, in Canberra, in Sydney, in Brisbane and in Melbourne, 'We want to engage you in the preparation of this bill, because the main beneficiaries of this bill at the moment, at this bank and shoal of time in our nation's history, are you, because it is your communities, primarily, that are the victims of those who would prey upon them.' As I have said many, many times, we see the Islamic communities of Australia as our partners in shaping legislation to protect their communities from predators, to save their young men and also, in some cases, their young women from being ensnared by these false siren voices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are discussing at the moment the sunset clause. Can I tell you, Senator Wright, that in an early iteration of this bill there was not a sunset clause. At an early iteration of the bill, the government was provisionally of the viewâ€”for the purposes of the discussionâ€”that perhaps these unusual measures in all the circumstances did need to be made a permanent feature of our law. I remember very clearly the meeting in Melbourne that I attended with Senator Fierravanti-Wells at which there was a long discussion about the removal of the sunset clause in an early draft of the bill. Members of the Islamic community said to me, 'Attorney-General, the removal of the sunset clause is a big issue for us. We believe that it would send a very, very strong signal to this community if the government were to reinstate the sunset clause.' I can tell you, Senator Wright, that it was as a direct result of the argument that it was put to the government by leaders of the Islamic community at that particular meeting, and then at another meeting about a week later in Brisbane, that I took the view that I ought to take that suggestion on board. So I inserted the sunset clause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the sunset clause has now been foreshortened as a result of a recommendation of the PJCIS. I do not know how you could have a better example of the government engaging with a community with a particular interest in this legislation, listening to its concerns, embracing its concerns and acting to give effect to its concerns than by the decision that I made, on the specific advice of those community leaders, to keep the sunset provision in operation.</span>

Certainly, it chills me to think that there was some consideration of removing the sunset clause totally. Going to a 10-year time frame is also a great concern. Making a virtue of bringing it back to four years, I suppose, is certainly better than 10 years or having no sunset clause at all. This very debate, as tiresome as it may be to some who want to get the legislation right through, given the extraordinary and intrusive law-enforcement and intelligence-gathering powers that we are actually talking about here, I think is evidence of the value of constantly being vigilant not only about terrorism but about the very freedoms that make our vibrant democracy such a wonderful place that people want to live in. The idea that we would have sunset clauses is necessary so that we are required, on a regular basis, to keep reassessing the freedoms that we perhaps are giving up, the risks that we are running and whether or not they are necessary, given the particular environment that we are living in.</span>

The Australian Greens, in this case, are in a difficult position because we certainly do not want to have the sunset clause extended at all. We feel that a year would give sufficient time to seriously evaluate and have proper scrutiny of the regime and then make a thoughtful, considered and methodical decision. However, the bill in its first iteration did propose 10 years and this amendment is going to reduce it to four years. So that is a less undesirable outcome than 10 years.</span>

With respect, is it possible to have that amendment put first?

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:03</span>):  With respect to these Greens amendments, (10) and (11) would prevent extension of the sunset provision to ASIO powersâ€”questioning warrants and detention warrants. Labor believes that we do face an especial security threat at this time and we are willing to extend extraordinary measures in order to equip our agencies to deal with this. We do not accept that these powers must stand for all time, and they must be subject to sunsets and to reviews, which has now been resolved. The intelligence committee substantially wound back the proposed ten-year period to just two years after the next election. We insisted on shorter sunsetting and on statutory review. This is the right and responsible approach to the present special security challenges.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding amendments (14) and (15), these would prevent the extension of sunset provisions to AFP powersâ€”preventative detention and control orders. Again, I highlight the special security threat that we face at this time and that we are willing to extend extraordinary measures in order to equip our agencies to deal with this. We do not accept that these powers must stand, as I have said, for all time. They are subject to sunset and review, as I have mentioned, two years after the next election or on the date Senator Brandis has highlighted, rather than the originally proposed 10 years or, indeed, as was discussed earlier, the potential that there be no limit at all. We believe these are sensible and balanced measures that ensure that we do have a review and a sunset. For that reason we are opposing all of these Greens amendments.</span>

The government is convinced and accepts the view that, given the gravity of the powers exercisable under a delayed notification search warrant, the authorisation should only be made by a relatively senior member of the judiciary, and therefore only members of the AAT who serve at the most senior tiers of that tribunal ought to be issuing authorities.</span>

The explanatory memorandum is not the law. The law is what is in the bill. It does not help to go adding things to the explanatory memorandum, except in cases where the law is not clear. The law is clear. Therefore, the public interest defence for a disclosure of delayed notification, or instances of corruption or misconduct, will not be available to defendants as a defence under normal circumstances. Indeed, it would only be available to defendants under circumstances where the court felt that the bill had not been drafted sufficiently accurately. Therefore, it is important that it be in the bill and not left to the explanatory memorandum.</span>

I think that that which ought to be in the bill should be in the bill, and it is no sufficient correction to put it into the explanatory memorandum. So, Senator Leyonhjelm, I agree with you that that is good drafting practice. However, that is really not the point here. What the amendment would do would be to introduce two additional exceptions to the unauthorised disclosure offence in the delayed notification search warrant regime. That regime is to be provided for by a new section, 3ZZHA, which sets out the offence and then sets out six circumstances that constitute exceptions to the offence. Those circumstances are various. I think it might be useful for this part of the debate if I read them to the chamber. The exceptions for the unauthorised disclosure of a delayed notification search warrant are that:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the six exemptions from the operation of the offence-creating provision by subsection (1), and it is the view of the government, and it was the view of the PJCIS, that those are the only exemptions that should be provided for. The PJCIS did explore the appropriateness of the exemptions in the bill; it recognised the importance of striking a balance between allowing for appropriate disclosure while maintaining the integrity of sensitive terrorism investigations. Taking the appropriate balance into account, the committee recommended taking additional exceptions to the offences to address disclosure in the course of obtaining legal advice and disclosure of warrant information to the Ombudsman. The government accepted that recommendation, and is introducing amendments to address it. The amendments are intended to ensure that persons who wish to report misconduct have an appropriate avenue to do so. In addition, the Commonwealth DPP is required already to take the public interest into account in deciding whether or not to prosecute someone for the offence. The government does not consider that further amendments are necessary, given the significant safeguards that will apply to the delayed notification search warrant regime.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Senator Leyonhjelm, as I say, public interest is already part of the law, and disclosure concerning corruption or misconductâ€”which is the point of your proposed subsection, paragraph (h)â€”is already dealt with by government amendment. For that reason and the reasons explained by the PJCIS, while having a degree of sympathy, if I may say so, with what you are seeking to achieve, what you are seeking to achieve is already achieved by existing law or by government amendments.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:26</span>):  I want to indicate that the Australian Greens will be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments in relation to the delayed notification search warrant regime. This regime really is unprecedented in many ways in that it allows someone's premises to be searched and that they would be unaware of the basis and authority for the search, and they would be unable to challenge or make a complaint about the issue of a warrant to allow it, or about the method of execution. In fact, they may not even become aware of the fact that someone has been in their premises for up to six months. Perhaps even more alarmingâ€”police would be allowed to enter premises by the premises of a third party to whom no concern or interest attaches at all, except that their premises are attached to the premises to be searched.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In scrutinising these sorts of provisions I am always conscious of taking the frame that, while we need to ensure that we can be protected from people who have malicious intent, and as careful as processes might be, we cannot assume that the person whose premises are searched is always the right personâ€”that there is always, in fact, a legitimate reason to search those premises. So I am always conscious about how this will impact on people who happen to be caught up in a regime which is so intrusive. The Australian Greens will support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments because they aim to ensure that someone who discloses information about a delayed notification search warrant as a matter of public interest, or who is a whistleblower, is not caught by criminal offences that prohibit disclosure of the search information in the bill. I am also satisfied that it is appropriate to have a sunset clause to the regime that is consistent with sunset clauses for other aspects of the bill, where we have such unprecedented and intrusive incursions into the liberties of people living in Australia.</span>

It prevents a new delayed notification search warrant being issued after the sunset date. It does not prevent a warrant that was issued earlier being executed. This is appropriate in context because delayed notification search warrants expire 30 days after being issued. Also, after a warrant is executed, there remain a number of ongoing obligations, such as the requirement to eventually give notification. This, in my view, should remain in force as a protective measure. In other words, this introduces the same sunset provision that the government has already accepted in relation to control orders and preventive detention orders, and simply brings delayed notification warrants under the same system.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRANDIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:37</span>):  The government will be opposing this amendment. Senator Leyonhjelm makes the reasonable point that delayed notification search warrants are an unusual mechanism. He goes on to sayâ€”by analogy with the treatment of control orders and preventative detention ordersâ€”that they, too, ought to be sunsetted. But, Senator Leyonhjelm, there are gradations of exceptionalism, as it were, in these powers. Control orders and preventative detention orders are very, very unusual powers. As I keep saying, they ought to beâ€”and have beenâ€”used extremely rarely. Delayed notification search warrants are somewhat less unusual. They are a standard feature of the criminal justice system of most states and territories, and have been so for a number of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Delayed notification search warrants are needed, and perhaps I might take the opportunity to explain the rationale for introducing this measure with the bill. Delayed notification search warrants are needed to enable the Australian Federal Police to investigate and prevent serious terrorism. They strengthen the legislative framework for Commonwealth investigations into terrorist threats. Under current Commonwealth search warrant provisions in the Crimes Act, the occupier of premises to be searched must be given a copy of the warrant if they are present, which means that a search cannot occur without the occupier being made aware that the search is taking place. That is the standard situation with the execution of a search warrant, of course. However, sometimes it is necessaryâ€”particularly in terrorism investigationsâ€”to keep the fact that a search has been conducted under warrant confidential. Keeping the existence of an investigation relating to terrorism offences confidential can be critical to their success, particularly when the investigation involves multiple suspects or multiple terrorist cells, or is conducted over an extended period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give an example of what I mean. Let us say that the Australian Federal Police were aware of a series of groups who were networked within a capital city, or perhaps between different capital cities, and they wished to carry out a search of the premises of one of the individuals who was a member of that network. If the standard procedure of the execution of a search warrant were to be observed, then the police would have to notify that suspect of the fact that they were conducting a search of his premises, and there would be nothing to stop that suspect then alerting other members of his network that they might imminently be the subject of a search warrant as well or of some other form of investigation. That could potentially substantially defeat the benefit of the investigation by denying the authorities the benefit of surprise. By the way, it is for that reason, Senator Leyonhjelm, that delayed notification search warrants are pretty much a standard feature now of investigation into various types of organised crime, for example, carried out by state and territory police forces. That is their rationale, and I am sure that you can understand that rationale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The option of delayed notification search warrants will, therefore, enable AFP officers to conduct investigations without a suspect being aware of their interest, providing a significant tactical advantage in an appropriate case. It will avoid suspects taking steps to avoid detection, relocate their operations or relocate and destroy evidence. It will also avoid suspects notifying their associates of police interests in their activities, as in the example that I gave you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The types of terrorism activities that could be investigated under this scheme may beâ€”and very often areâ€”sophisticated networks involved in financing terrorism, recruiting for a terrorist organisation and providing training for terrorist acts. Delayed notification search warrants will increase the opportunity for successful investigations of terrorism offences and enhance the ability of the AFP to gather information about planned operations with a view to preventing a terrorism offence from being committed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Leyonhjelm, I think that in explaining to you the rationale for having, in appropriate circumstances, a delayed notification scheme for search warrants I have also explained to you why it is not appropriate that it be sunsetted. The investigative need for such a capability is not something that is going to diminish over time. We have sunsetted control orders and we have sunsetted preventative detention ordersâ€”the most unusual tool in the apparatusâ€”because we hope that maybe the day will come that orders of that kind will no longer be needed. For as long as criminals act in networks, for as long as criminals act covertly and for as long as criminalsâ€”not necessarily terroristsâ€”act in a sophisticated manner, the need on occasions to be able to conduct a search of one member of that network without alerting other members of that network to the fact that they have been sprung is not going to go away. I think as a matter of common sense, Senator Leyonhjelm, you would see that. That is why, in the government's view and in the committee's view, it is not appropriate that a mechanism of this kind be sunsetted.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:44</span>):  Labor takes a different perspective to Senator Leyonhjelm on the delayed notification warrants scheme. Some of the powers conferred in this bill are clearly extraordinary, and, accordingly, are subject to sunsettingâ€”sunsetting which Labor has brought back to just four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, some parts of this bill are structural reforms. That is, enhancements to agency powers which are intended to be ongoing. The delayed notification warrant scheme is one such agency power. There is no need for this scheme to be sunsetted. This part of the bill brings the powers of the AFP into line with the other Australian police forces. I will quote from the Intelligence Committee again here:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the Committee notes that delayed notification search warrants do represent a significant departure from the normal search warrant scheme provided for in the Crimes Act, it also notes that many other Australian police forces have access to similar, if not more intrusive, powers. Given the threat posed by terrorism and foreign fighters, the Committee considers it is appropriate that the AFP have access to these powers for serious terrorism offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because we think that the balance has been struck on these issues in the Intelligence Committee's consideration, Labor opposes this amendment. The delayed notification warrant scheme is an important tool for the AFP in its counter-terrorism capacity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:46</span>):  I cannot help but remind the Attorney-General that we have dealt with criminals at a Commonwealth level now without delayed notification warrants since we have had Commonwealth criminal law. The trouble I have with this provision is not that delayed notification warrants might be needed under the current circumstances; I do not find the argument that we anticipate that these will be needed for the indefinite future at all compelling. If it is anticipated that there will be any need for them in four years' time, they can be re-enacted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is felt that preventative detention orders and control orders are serving a useful purposeâ€”and the evidence suggests so far that that is not the case, but perhaps they will be shown to be serving a useful purposeâ€”then they will also have to be re-enacted. There is nothing wrong with legislation that lapses unless it is felt that it is serving a useful purpose and therefore is justified and maintained. The assumption that we know what will be the circumstances relating to terrorism, or whatever else the law is intended to apply to, in years ahead cannot be made today. We do not know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is perfectly legitimate to argue on the one hand that delayed notification warrants can be justified. I am really not disagreeing with that, although I certainly will vote against the bill itselfâ€”but for other reasons. But to suggest that we can anticipate that this is going to be required indefinitely into the future is illogical. I would ask the Attorney-General to reconsider.</span>

I thought you were a libertarian. Yet the argument that we have just heard from you characterises you as the most rock-ribbed conservative; because if your argument were to be taken to its logical conclusion, we would never legislate for anything because we could never be completely certain about what might happen in the future. We would never reform the law and we would never have amended the Commonwealth Crimes Act since its first iteration in the first parliament 112 years ago.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that we, as legislators, have to make judgements about how to put the law in the best shape possible in various areas of public policy. When it comes to criminal law, it is possible to identify a gapâ€”as there is hereâ€”in law enforcement techniques and capabilities and to say that because we have identified that gap, the law stands in need of reform not for a few years hence but because we have actually identified a gap that is not likely to go away.</span>

Because I do not. If it is in the nature of criminal conduct that criminals, particularly sophisticated criminals, will operate in networks, then there is a rational argument for configuring our search warrant powers in such a way that the execution of the search warrant against one member of that network will not expose the operation so as to enable other members of that work to be tipped off to escape or to rid themselves evidentiary material that might be incriminating or would otherwise degrade the capability of the criminal investigation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:00</span>):  Tonight I rise to speak on a matter of extraordinary concern to many of my fellow citizens in South Australia, and that is the extraordinary increase in the emergency services levy that came out in the South Australian state budget. By way of background, in 1999 the South Australian Liberal government introduced a levy specifically to replace an insurance premium levy with a broader emergency services levy to cover the cost of looking after the issues of our emergency services. When they introduced the levy, they made a decision that they would exempt a large number of organisations from the full impact of that levy, recognising the contribution that they made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2014-15 budget, the government sought to remove the remission of this levy from a number of properties, except for the principal place of residence for pensioners and concession card holders. At the time they introduced this particular piece of legislation they forgot to realise that people who lived in retirement villages were not actually property owners and would be exposed to the removal of the remission of the emergency services levy. I am pleased to say that they have seen the error of their ways subsequently. It probably just goes to show how ill-informed this particular levy was. They subsequently tried to find blame for the change in the levy structure that was specifically for assisting emergency services personnel and operations in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought it would be interesting to put on the record that, in 2010, the Henry tax review came out and said that a land tax on the family home as part of state taxation reform was a good idea. At the time, the then Treasurer, Kevin Foley, made this comment:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is really quite interesting, given that the government that he is part of and is now in government has chosen to do exactly the opposite. You would be excused for being a little confused because the now Treasurer in South Australia, Tom Koutsantonis, on ABC morning radio the other day, when questioned about whether a tax on a $400,000 property would increase by 163 three per cent, said no, it would not increase by 163 per cent, but his very own Treasury figures, as are witnessed by his Treasury document, show that if you have a property with a capital value of $400,000 you will indeed have an increase in your emergency services levy by 163 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Probably the most concerning of the impacts that this proposed increase in the emergency services levy has had in South Australia was shown very recently when there were two grassfires on the west coast, at a place near Ceduna. The CFS volunteers for the first time in history that I can remember refused to attend those fires. They had a reason for refusing to attend those fires. Since they have to pay this extraordinary increase in their emergency services levyâ€”and some of them are paying 400, 500, 800 or 1,500 times as much as they paid last year for their emergency services levyâ€”they said, 'Why would we go and fight a bushfire if they are collecting that much money to assist us in our emergency services activities? Why wouldn't the government be able to afford to pay full tote odds for every person who turns up to a fire? They don't need to worry about volunteers anymore because the government is taking this much money.' Farmers and business people cannot afford to let their employees go to fight these fires on a voluntary basis and accept the responsibility of continuing to pay these employees if they have to pay the exorbitant emergency service levy costs. It is an absolute disgrace and the South Australian government should be condemned for what they have done.</span>

They are all in the 3/4 Fiji class at Camdenville Public School in Sydney. The letters are notable for the complex and timely topics they address and the heart-felt opinions which are expressed. Bronte, Kira, Jenny, Bella, Ruby, Ellie and Kayla voiced their concerns over animal welfare. Looking to the ocean first, they argue that killing sharks and whales is an unnecessary act of crueltyâ€”concerns that my colleagues Senators Peter Whish-Wilson and Rachael Siewert also feel passionate about and have taken up many times. I think they would like to know that the International Court of Justice banned whaling in the Antarctic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding domestic animals, they urge dog owners to act responsibly and care for their pets. They also spoke with great concern about farm animals. They make a passionate case on factory farming, detailing how it is. They state:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ bad for chickens and other farmed animals as it is cruel. Chickens are probably the most abused animals on the planet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will let them know about the recent ban on caged egg production in the ACT, a reform led by the Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Riley, Adam, Ethan, Jonathon, Nicholas, Cooper, Shakeel and Tiago protest the recent agreement to sell uranium to India. They wrote in their letter:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">One nuclear missile could blow up an entire city and you know how bad that would be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They warn of the catastrophic danger of nuclear weapons and note that the Indian government has not signed the non-proliferation treaty. Senator Ludlam has long argued that this is one of the biggest reasons to tear up the deal with Indiaâ€”and in my reply I will expand on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Roxy and Rizal took up another issue close to my heart, Australia's treatment of asylum seekers. They wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We would be delighted if Australia could accomplish a law of freedom to refugees. We hope you can support our arguments and help refugees all over our world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They note that, despite international conventions, refugees are still suffering. These students highlight that the Australian government is failing to honour our agreements, increasing suffering for those who have already suffered so much. Roxy and Rizal could be two international human rights lawyers in the making. Seeing young students tackle such a topic makes me optimistic about the future. Not only are they thinking deeply about issues which many adults struggle to address but they have taken the time to organise together and voice their concerns. One of the best things students can learn at school is the importance of engaging with the community. If we see something wrong, the future calls on us to voice our concerns and fix it. This is certainly what I believe, and it was heartening to receive these letters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These letters also make clear the failings of our education system under successive governments. Just imagine the support that students like this could receive with a properly funded public education system. Instead of splashing out public funds on private schools, we could be ensuring that these bright minds get the resources and the teachers they deserve. If these students want to pursue their higher education in 10 years, what sort of higher education will await them? The Liberal government in New South Wales is well on its way to gutting TAFE, pushing students into private providers, where quality runs a distant second to profit. Our university system already loads up students with tens of thousands of dollars of debt, with massive increases on the cards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the damage that Liberal-National governments and Labor governments have inflicted on public education over the decades, these letters do make me optimistic that the future is in safe hands. I thank the students from the Fiji class for their correspondence and congratulate the whole team at Camdenville Public School, the students, the teachers and all the staff. I appreciated receiving your letters, and I hope this is just the start of an illustrious letter-writing future for all of these students.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CANAVAN:</span>
                  </a>  and thank you, Senator Mason. I was just speaking to Senator Day, from South Australia, about a fellow state person of his, Bert Kelly, who used to be the member for Wakefield for a long time. He would be familiar to many people in this house. Along with his many other achievements, statements and successes over time, Bert Kelly also had an aphorism that, when you heard a politician or a government announcing a new dam, you could smell an election just around the corner. That was very true perhaps in Bert's time, but things have changed greatly since that time. It is not the case now that you would be able to time elections on the announcements of dams. This is for the simple fact that we have not builtâ€”nor announced the building ofâ€”a major dam in most parts of this country for more than 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a few dams built in that timeâ€”the Burdekin Falls Dam in North Queensland is oneâ€”but they were generally announced a long time before that. Dams take a long time to build, they take a long time to think through, they have a big impact on the environment and communities and they need to be thought through. That is why governments need to show vision and foresight in getting behind these projects so that we can have a strong agricultural sector, so that our mining sector can have water and so that our towns and communitiesâ€”particularly in regional areasâ€”can have access to affordable water too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend a bit of time tonight talking about the prospects for new dams in one part of our countryâ€”that is, in central Queensland in and around the Fitzroy Basin. The Fitzroy Basin should be better known to all Australians, but it is probably one that most would not be familiar with. It is alone the biggest water catchment on our eastern seaboard. More water flows out of the Fitzroy River into the Pacific Ocean than from any other river in this country. Most people would not know that. The flows in that region of itself equal about one-fifth of the Murray-Darling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling is a huge area which covers four statesâ€”and services the ACT, where we sit tonightâ€”and its flows are only five times larger than that of the Fitzroy Basin, which is a much smaller area. We have developed the Murray-Darling over many years and now have the capacity to store around 70 per cent of the flows of the Murray-Darling. Each year around 33,000 gigalitres flow out of the different areas of the Murrayâ€”most of them eventually find their way down to the mouth in South Australia. We can store around 80 per cent of that flow, and that gives us great security in this part of our country, because we can store water in the wet times so that we can use that water in the dry times to grow food.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do that in this nation, because we have very variable water flows. The city of Melbourne can store enough water for 10 years. If it got no rain for 10 years and all its dams were filled, it could still supply itself with water. In London, they can only store for a couple of years. It rains a lot in England, so they do not need that storage. We need that storage here in this nation because of that variability. But, in the Fitzroy Basin, we can only store around 30 per cent of the flows of the Fitzroy Basin. It is an undeveloped and untapped resource for our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago when we were on a break from work and from down here, a few members of the LNP did a tour around the Fitzroy Basin: me; the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry; and the member for Flynn, Ken O'Dowd. We jumped in a plane and flew around some of the sites in this catchment. We also went to see the towns of Moranbah and Emerald to talk to those communities about what they wanted in terms of water storage. I want to briefly describe some of the potential opportunities. You hear from people that all the good dam sites in this nation are goneâ€”all developed. That is rubbish. Some of the good sites have gone, in some parts of our country. But there remain untapped areas on the frontiers of our nation where we can grow new food bowls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have one very good food bowl here in the Murray-Darling, but I think we need a second food bowl in our nation. I think we are big enough to have a second food bowl somewhere in our nation, and I think the Fitzroy Basin could potentially be that place. There is a dam site on the Connors River, which is in the northern part of the Fitzroy catchment. It is a dam that could potentially store 375,000 megalitres, a pretty big damâ€”not the biggest, but a good size dam. It has already achieve state and federal approval for environmental purposes. So, it has already gone through all the environmental assessment processes. Most senators would be familiar with how onerous those are these days. It took years, but it has gone through those processes, so even the Greens should be supporting this particular dam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That water could be used for some agriculture in the local area, but it will also be very crucial for coalmining in the Galilee Basin. Coalmining needs water tooâ€”about 100 or 200 litres for every tonne of coal you mine, to wash that coal. There are some big projects going ahead in the Galilee Basin. But because this dam is going to be used for that, I am sure the Greens will oppose it. They do not want to see those 10,000 jobs that would be provided in Central Queensland. But if we want those jobs we need the dam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another site called the Nathan Dam, which is on the southern end of the Fitzroy Basin. It is a much bigger dam. It could potentially store almost 900,000 megalitresâ€”quite a large dam. It does not have its environmental approval yet, but the Queensland government is hopeful that it will receive that next year. The dam has been held up for about five years because of a snailâ€”a community of Boggomoss snails that was discovered in 2008 or 2009 on the site. They discovered 850 of them, and I do not have time to go into the whole sage, but they have since discovered 18,000 nearby. I do not understand how they missed the 18,000 snails on their first pass, but the dam has been held up for five years because of this environmental red tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="84M" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Mason:</span>
                  </a>  It's moving at a snail's pace!</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CANAVAN:</span>
                  </a>  That comment has been made before, Senator Mason. It is indeed moving at a snail's pace; you are absolutely right. But with the new one-stop shops that the government has implemented, we have signed an agreement with Queensland. Unfortunately the Labor Party do not want to see dams built; they do not want to see a streamlined environmental approvals process. We have not got the legislation through this place, but there should be some benefit through that one-stop shop that Minister Hunt has put in place. That dam will be used for agriculture and is very important for the cotton industry in Central Queensland, around Emerald. It could really increase the efficiencies and scale of that industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two other sites I want to mention tonight are Eden Bann and Rookwood. Eden Bann is already a weir, but we can expand that weir, and Rookwood would be a new weir. All up they would store around 200,000 megalitresâ€”pretty large. And they principally would be used for local agriculture in the Rockhampton region, largely horticulture, and also to supply Gladstone with water for its industrial needs, which are getting to be pretty scare at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, there are plenty of very good sites in this region. It is an untapped resource that I hope the government will now focus on. The Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, released a green paper last week in which he says he wants to build dams. All these sites are listed among those 27, so I hope we can see them come to fruitionâ€”and so do the people of Emerald and Moranbah; they want these dams to come to fruition as well. Firstly, they will be great construction projects to provide jobs in this regionâ€”jobs that are sorely needed given the slowdown in the mining sector and the coalmining sector in Central Queensland. More importantly, these projects will provide reliable, consistent and affordable supplies of water for these towns and communities. In Moranbah they rely on mining companies to provide them with water. It is not a very secure position for them to be in, and, as I said, with these new mine developments water is becoming scarce for those industries. And Emerald, while its water will not benefit directly from these dams, is at risk. If we cannot find new sources of water these new mines will come to Fairbairn Dam near Emerald and seek to take the water from there, and that will mean lower agricultural production in the Emerald region, and fewer jobs. And it will not be expanding our agriculture or our food bowl but detracting from it, and I do not want to see that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we have outlined an agenda as a government to build dams, and we need to try to see these come to fruition now. Dams are hard things for the private sector to do alone, because they are very large projects that pay off over many years and they are exposed to great regulatory risks from government, both around the quantity of water that is provided and around the pricing of that water over time. That is all regulated by governments. There is therefore a need for the public sector to take some of those risks, to share those risks with the private sector to ensure that these viable projects which are going to provide great community benefits in terms of jobs, in terms of food and in terms of better water security go ahead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARSHALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President of the Senate and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:20</span>):  On the night of 22 August last year a resident of Hillside, in Melbourne's western suburbs, was turning his car into his driveway when he was rammed from behind. Â Â Â The force of the impact slammed his car into his corner fence, causing extensive damage to his car and property. Â Â Â The driver of the other car then leapt out and assaulted Mr Vittori, including punching him in the face up to six times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes this case so disturbing is that this attack was carried out by members of the Victorian police force. Police officers had been following Mr Vittori for around two kilometres because the car he was driving was unregistered at the time. Mr Vittori testified that he was unaware that he was being followed. After the vicious assault Mr Vittori was taken back to the station and left in a police cell for four hours. He was then charged with reckless conduct endangering life by the local police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of what actually happened that night may never have been known if it was not for the confession made by one of the police officers four days after the incident.  The junior officer confessed to a supervisor that he and the senior officer had concocted a story. What actually happened that night was partially revealed via the onboard camera in the patrol vehicle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Footage shows the police car ramming Mr Vittori's car into the brick fence. However, before he jumped out of the car and assaulted Mr Vittori, the senior constable and driver of the car deliberately switched off the patrol car camera. He then, at a later date, tried to delete the footage, but investigators found a copy on a backup disk. Footage then captured audio of the senior constable telling his partner what to tell their boss, ordering him to say the victim had aimed his car at them and had heavily rammed their car while they were in it. This concocted story would explain the damage to the patrol car and justify the charges laid on the victim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 October this year, the junior officer faced court for his role in fabricating the story. He was fined $3,000 and released without conviction on a charge of making a false report. In handing down his decision, Magistrate Charlie Rozencwajg said Victoria Police appeared to suffer from a similar culture of silence to the criminal world. Magistrate Rozencwajg said that, in the criminal underworld, informing on a colleague was known as being a 'dog'. 'A similar culture for whatever reason existed in the police force,' Magistrate Rozencwajg said. The junior officer's defence lawyers said that, if not for Roberts coming clean to a supervisor, it would have been unlikely the truth of the incident would ever have emerged. The victim, Mr Vittori, was charged by police for ramming their patrol car when, in fact, the opposite was true. Police were comfortable fabricating the charges and would have assumed that their joint testimony would see the victim prosecuted. They would have put Mr Vittori through months, if not years, of pain and suffering as he tried to defend himself against the charges that may have even seen him sent to jail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said in previous speeches, it is common for individuals to be further charged by police where there are complaints made about police assaults. The Flemington &amp; Kensington Community Legal Centre says there have been 10 cases since 2006 in which African-Australians were charged with hindering police after they made an official complaint. In the subsequent court cases, magistrates ruled that officers had used inappropriate force against them, entered property without proper warrant or stopped suspects without due cause. In every case, police charges were thrown out of court and compensation paid to the victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of violence concerns a case in April 2009. Eight police officers investigating the theft of two bags of chips from a nearby 7-Eleven entered the rear of a Williamstown property without a warrant. They attacked three teenagers of African descent who were hanging out in the rear bungalow. According to one of the victims, Kenyan-born Zacharia Matiang, a police officer demanded he tell him who stole the chips and then assaulted him. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Out of the blue he took a pepper spray can and put it into my face and just started spraying, like I was some type of insect. Everything went blank in my head. There was screaming and yelling and pepper spray cans going off like fire hoses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I saw them drag one of the boys out of the room and they were stomping the hell out of him, kicking him on the floor and everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A police officer was on my back putting handcuffs on me, dragging me to the front yard and he did assault me with his baton and punched me, too. He took me to the side of the house and punched me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the attack on the individuals in the bungalow, an officer sprayed capsicum spray into the main house. A mother and three infant children, the youngest of whom was just three months old, were in the room at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lawyers from the Flemington &amp; Kensington Community Legal Centre assisted the victims to make an official complaint and launch a civil case against the police involved. The complaint was ultimately investigated by the Office of Police Integrity. They dedicated two full pages of their 2010-11 annual report to the matter. To quote the report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This case study clearly raises concerns about 'over-policing' associated with racial targeting. Eight police personnel and two paramedics were involved in pursuing a shoplifter who had been caught on CCTV stealing goods worth $10.65 â€¦ <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The leading senior constable knew the occupier of the bungalow was a minor, but rather than approach him in the presence of his mother, he initiated a confrontation that involved four innocent  young people.</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The OPI found that the officers had used excessive force and forwarded its investigation to police for action. However, even after the damning findings of the OPI, the force ethical standards division conducted its own review and found that many of the OPI findings were not valid. No officer was charged or reprimanded for their role in the assault. Victoria Police completely ignored the findings of the body established to oversee its activities. The civil lawsuit launched in parallel to the complaint was settled confidentially before it reached court. We do not know if compensation was paid to those assaulted by police but what we do know is that no police officer has had to answer for their actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fitzroy Legal Service, another community legal service, raises the case of a Somali man, Mohamed Hassan. Mohamed Hassan was pulled over for speeding by a senior constable. Mohamed was punched in the head, which fractured his jaw, was forced to the ground, was handcuffed and then taken to a police cell. Hassan faced several charges from police, including disturbing the good order or management of the police jailâ€”and that was for spitting blood on the floor of a holding cell. Mohamed made a complaint against the police, which was investigated by the police ethical standards division. The complaint was not substantiated after the local police were tasked to investigate it. But, in 2012, Magistrate Peter Couzens ruled that Hassan had been unlawfully punched by the senior constable. Magistrate Peter Couzens told Mr Hassan:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm satisfied that you were a victim of an assault on that day by a police officer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He found that the senior constable had acted unlawfully. Still, to this day, no action has been taken against the police officer who assaulted Mohamed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is clear from these cases and the other cases I have previously raised in the Senate that we have a systemic problem in the Victorian police force. The lack of an independent investigation of complaints made against police has led to a culture where it appears some police feel their actions are not subject to any real review or oversight, and, in the case where they overstep the mark, they can lay charges on the victims of their assaults and rely on support from colleagues to back their version of events. In this culture, most victims are unwilling to press charges or make complaints. Victims are all too aware that the most likely outcome will be further charges laid against them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The power granted to police by the community must not be abused. Policing canâ€”and mustâ€”be done with integrity. No-one in our state should be above the law. Police will continue to operate without the threat of real penalties for their actions until we have an independent investigation of complaints made against them. I again call for the establishment of a fully independent body to oversee the complaints against police and that this body be well funded and have a number of investigation teams that have the power to press charges against police for misconduct. What we know in Victoria is that if we expect justice to prevail, we cannot rely on police to investigate police. We must have an independent body that can not only investigate police but lay charges against police for their misconduct.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In defence of the senior officers and government ministers who are in charge of Australia's military, I would like to say to this parliament that this mean and insulting pay offer to members of our Army, Navy and RAAF is an act which is out of character for those responsible and that somehow it is an uncharacteristic stuff-up from a group of competent, honourable people who have a distinguished management record. However, I am sad to say, for the ordinary diggers, sailors and airmen and womenâ€”and their familiesâ€”I cannot say that truthfully.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This despicable wage offer is just one bastard act in a long list of bastard acts carried out by senior ADF officers who have lost the respect of their troops as they have fallen over themselves to forward their own careers at the expense of their mates while they suck up to two of the most incompetent and uncaring Defence and veterans' affairs minsters that Australia has ever seen in history. I am sickened by the performance of the senior officers in charge of our ADF. They are smug, self-serving, gutless individuals who have dishonoured their own uniform. If they had any honour they would resign from their positions rather than be part of the Liberal-National government's plan to take leave, entitlements and, effectively, money out of the pockets of their own troops.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shame, Binskin! Shame, Griggs! Shame, Morrison! Your years of service will be rightly tainted and stained by your compliance with a despicable government wage offer to people you are supposed to support and protect at all times. How dare you present yourselves before this parliament and in public and allow yourselves and, worse still, your uniforms and high positions in our ADF to be the mouthpieces and apologists for despicable and incompetent politicians whose actions prove they do not know the meaning of service, trust, loyalty and honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government have their way and their wage offer of 1.5 per cent for the next three years and loss of six days leave remains, then I am going to start a public campaign which will call on all Australians to turn their backs on any government minister or backbencher who decides to give a speech and presentation on Anzac Day for the centenary next year. If Liberal or National party members think that they can be part of a government which takes money and conditions away from members of our military and not feel any political pain then they have got another think coming. Every chance I get I will be urging Australian citizens who want to help our Defence Force members receive a fair pay offer to shun and turn their backs on government ministers and backbenchers who try to deliver speeches, especially on Anzac Day for the centenary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the cover-up of veteran suicide rates. Why have successive Liberal and Labor federal governments made it so hard for the widows and dependents of veterans who take their own lives to make a claim for compensation? The Abbott government was forced to admit recently that in the past 14 years since 2000 only 13 official compensation payments were made to the dependents of veterans who committed suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, everyone in the ex-service community knows that, since 2000, hundreds of veterans who saw active service in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan have committed suicide. So how have senior military officers, politicians and Commonwealth public servants been able escape being held to account for this national disgrace? Our senior military officers and government bureaucrats know that Australia has never had enough troops and military resources to safely carry out the orders given to them by our politicians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All public service and military leadership know that, in the last 15 years, a relatively small number of combat troops were expected to carry a massive active service workload and that the present veteran suicide crisis is a direct result of military leadership silence and compliance with orders from politicians who overcommitted our underresourced Defence Force to foreign wars. Why else would the top brass and politicians allow our soldiers to have their active service deployments increased from six to eight months; complete up to 13 tours of active duty in just over a decade; and go on armed, combat patrols while officially receiving antipsychotic medication?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> The reason all political parties, senior military and government bureaucrats want to cover up veteran suicide rate is that it is damming proof of their incompetence and failure to stand up for our diggers. Today, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, rose in this place and talked about mental health, trying to give the impression he cares about veterans living with mental health illnesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I almost bought what he was selling â€”the deep voice, the measured delivery. I have to admire the minister: he has almost mastered the art of faking sincerity. But he and I both know that he does not care one little bit about people with mental disabilities. After suffering from mental illness in the past, brought on because of a vicious battle with the Department of Veterans' Affairsâ€”as has been the case for many former members of the ADFâ€”I have tried to show respect, care and consideration to people who live with mental disabilities. Indeed, I have tried to employ people who are living with forms of mental disabilities so that I could create a workplace with diversity and that is free from discrimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, through Minister Ronaldson and the Prime Minister, despite a wonderful antidiscrimination policy, have gone out of their way to prevent me from employing people with disabilities. They have placed unreasonable work conditions and travel restrictions on the people whom I chose to work with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One prospective employee was a commandoâ€”that is rightâ€”who served his time for our country, had his head almost blown off in battle and suffered immense brain damage. The government refused to accommodate his modest travel and living requests so that he could continue serving his country in a different form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another is a nationally acclaimed whistleblower, who has risked her career to save the lives of thousands of Australians and, in so doing, has suffered terribly. Once again, this government and this vindictive minister have refused to accommodate her reasonable travel requests, which would save the government $5,000 a year. I am putting this minister and government on notice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, I will not accept any more of the Prime Minister's or the Minister for Veterans' Affairs spiteful, illegal and discriminatory attitude towards people with mental illness or other disabilities. I look forward during this week to detailing to the chamber the appalling discriminatory behaviour of Minister Ronaldson and Prime Minister Abbott, whose actions contradict their worthless and insincere words in this chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="217241" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McGRATH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:40</span>):  Like many in the Senate I am a great believer in freedom. In Australia we are fortunate to have constitutional government and strong democratic institutions to uphold and protect our freedom. Sadly, in today's troubled world, there are peoples who cannot boast of such things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, I wish to drawn attention to the challenges confronting the people of the Maldives as they seek their own democratic future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of their struggle, a political fairytale where the prisoner defeated the jailer, of the fall of dictatorship, the establishment of a nascent democracy and the gradual slide back towards tyranny is a reminder to each of us that safeguarding freedom is a perpetual battle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people think of the Maldives, they think of a far-flung tropical island paradise: of white sandy beaches, blue lagoons and vibrant coral reefs. But under former dictator Gayyoom, Asia's longest serving dictator, the Maldives was renowned for harsh treatment of political opponents, including imprisonment and torture, curtailments placed on freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, in that country's first free multiparty elections, Mohamed Nasheed was elected, a reformist president. I should declare a conflict of interest; I worked on that campaign. He introduced pensions, health insurance for all, disability allowances, inter-atoll transport and democratic reforms to freedom of expression. He also fought drugs. Under President Nasheed, international measures of freedom of speech and freedom of the press improved markedly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, as a very peaceful person, he refused to punish those miscreants, those criminals, who transgressed under the former regime. But in February 2012 there was a coup. And, no matter how it is dressed up, a democratically elected president was removed from power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, in the time allotted to me, I want to talk about judicial corruption, political violence, suppression of the media and the abduction and possible murder of journalist Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla. Following Nasheed's departure from power, the political situation in this island paradise began to deteriorate and slide into authoritarianism and religious extremism. There were police crackdowns on Maldivian Democratic Party supporters. Over 800 supporters of the MDP were arrested in the first year following President Nasheed's resignation. President Nasheed himself faced arrest and had to flea to the Indian High Commission for sanctuary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, let us talk about the judicial process in the Maldives. A worrying trend has been for the Supreme Court to violate the separation of powers outlined in the 2008 constitution and interfere with electoral and human rights organs of state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The presidential election in 2013 was held amidst controversy, with the Supreme Court and the independent Electoral Commission clashing over who had constitutional authority over the elections. The Supreme Court of the Maldives ultimately prevailed, whereby it twice cancelled and delayed elections that it appeared Nasheed would win. Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist </span>magazine noted that the Maldives held as many elections as were needed to stop President Nasheed from winning power. The third attempt at the election was won by Abdulla Yameen, younger brother of former dictator Gayyoom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the parliamentary elections in 2014 the Supreme Court, under unusual procedures which allowed it to initiate proceedings, prosecute and pass judgement, took action against the Maldives Elections Commission. The four commissioners were charged with contempt of court and disobeying orders for not following the Supreme Court's election guidelines. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, in September 2014, the same Supreme Court, filled with appointees of the former dictator, issued similar proceedings against the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives for their report submitted to the UN on the deteriorating human rights position in the Maldives. The Human Rights Commission of the Maldives is charged with undermining the constitution and sovereignty of the Maldives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We move from judicial corruption into political violence. In September this year the MDP headquarters, in capital, Male, and President Nasheed's family home were vandalised. That same day individuals were seen to destroy the security cameras of Minivan News, an independent news website, with a machete left in the office door. In October, only days ago, the MDP held a rally in Addu City, an MDP stronghold. The rally was attacked by masked men with wooden planks, iron rods, and stones. The same night, the MDP office in Addu City was torched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October this year, Amnesty International, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and the European Union all expressed concern over the violence prevalent in the Maldives, noting it posed a critical test of the Maldivian government's will to maintain democracy. Only days ago, members of the Majlis, which is the parliament of the Maldives, were urged not to go out at night, amid the growing threats of violence and risks of attack upon elected officials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This leads me to the suppression of the media and free speech. In July 2012, there was a near fatal attack on a blogger, Hilath Rasheed, an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience, which it is claimed was carried out by Islamic extremists. Journalist Aswad Ibrahim Waheed of Raajje TV, the MDP-aligned news channel, was nearly beaten to death in February 2013. This same TV station was torched in October 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June of this year vigilante groups abducted young men identified for promoting secularism on social media. The democracy focused Facebook page 'Colorless' had its administration hijacked by vigilante justice groups. But most concerning of all, apart from the violence that is being let upon the people of the Maldives, and especially the journalists of the Maldives, is that in September of this year the government announced regulations requiring government approval to publish poetry and literature, allegedly to protect social etiquette and align publications with religious codes, a move widely condemned as censorship and a blatant attack on free speech and in stark contrast to progress made under Nasheed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most concerning of all is that on 8 August 2014 Maldivian journalist, blogger and social media activist Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla was abducted outside his apartment. He has not been seen or heard from since. Rilwan had received numerous death threats from religious extremists for several years for his views on tolerance and freedom of expression, and advocacy against religious extremism. Shortly before he disappeared, Rilwan wrote about 15 Maldivian journalists who had received death threats over their coverage of gang related violence. The abduction of Rilwan is an attack on free press. It is an attack on freedom of expression, a right Maldivians have long fought and struggled for. Human rights NGO Maldivian Democracy Network commissioned a UK based private investigator to conduct an investigation into the journalist's disappearance. The investigator concluded that radicalised criminal gangs were involved in the abduction, with the help of corrupt government and police officials likely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a friend of the Maldives I say to the government of the Maldives that your country might be small but your people are strong-hearted and stand tall in the fight for freedom. The world is watching you, President Yameen. Be a true leader and let your people be free. Let them speak freely. Let them be without fear of violence. Let them have rights of association. Let them talk, write and join together as free peoples. Do not lead your country into the shadows of fear and hate and violence. Stamp on ISIS and other agents of hate. Let the Maldives be free. President Yameen, the world is watching you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:48</span>):  I rise to bring to the Senate's attention the tragedy occurring in West Africa with the outbreak of the Ebola crisis. In doing so I recognise that yet another day has passed with more Ebola infections in West Africa, another day of more deaths due to Ebola in West Africa, and yet another day of the Abbott government sitting on its hands and failing to take the advice of the medical experts and provide the assistance on the ground to support those in West Africa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also bring to the attention of the Senate the important work that is being done by a small group of dedicated members of the Sierra Leonean community in Australia, many of them based in my home state of Tasmania, responding to the worsening Ebola crisis in West Africa. Whilst in the midst of this humanitarian and medical emergency facing the world, there has been this widespread concern about the Australian government being slow to take action and to respond to the crisis with the seriousness that it very much deserves, one group has not been slow to react, and that is SEAGA, the Salone Ebola Action Group Australia. SEAGA has been formed by concerned and active members of the Sierra Leonean community. It has chapters throughout the states and territories. Through their networks of family and friends in West Africa, these are the people who have been most aware of what is happening on the ground and they have decided that they themselves must take action to address the terrible developments they have been hearing about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The depths of the losses felt in Sierra Leone and their impact on the community here cannot be overstated. Many individuals have had loved ones who have fallen victim to the epidemic. One particularly tragic example of this is Isaiah Lahai, a member of the community in Hobart. Four months ago his nephew in Sierra Leone contracted Ebola after visiting a hospital to help victims of the disease. He died soon after. Since then, the outbreak has spread more widely and has claimed a further seven members of his family. The impact on Mr Lahai, and on his wife and five children is understandably very deep. He is in constant contact with his relatives to monitor their situation, fearing their loss. Despite these shocks Isaiah has responded to the crisis not by retreating into griefâ€”I am sure, though, that he is suffering griefâ€”or by being dispirited by the inaction of Australian government authorities. Instead, with his fellow members of SEAGA, he has been taking constructive and concrete action to assist the Sierra Leonean government and its health workers to combat the spread of the epidemic and care for its victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Wednesday, 22 October, I met with Isaiah and with the national coordinator of SEAGA, Mr Ansumana Usman Koroma, in my office in Hobart to hear about the work the association is undertaking and what they need from the Commonwealth to assist them in helping the effort over there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ebola outbreak has reached a point that is beyond the capacity of the government of Sierra Leone to contain on its own. The weakness in the current health infrastructure is made worse by the shortage of medical staff and basic protective gear like gloves, aprons, face masks and so on to control the disease, as well as equipment like IV fluids and cannulas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sierra Leone's chief medical officer, Dr Brima Kargbo, has provided SEAGA with a list of medical equipment and supplies that are needed for the set-up of treatment centres and to support the ones already in existence in the virus epicentre districts of Kailahun and Kenema. Working off this listâ€”which I sawâ€”and engaging with international donors, SEAGA has filled a shipping container with supplies and equipment that has now, as we speak, been sent off across to Freetown, the capital, by sea. With more assistance from the Australian government they may have been able to send all of this equipment via air to get the supplies there faster and to meet the urgent need for them. The national medical associations like the Australian Medical Association and the Public Health Association of Australia, as well as international ones like Medecins Sans Frontieres, have called for the Australian government to do more to assist in this crisisâ€”and rightly so. The United States Security Council and President Obama have called explicitly for personnel to go to West Africa. Labor has written to the Abbott government to give its backing to the AMA's request for support for the recruitment and deployment of volunteer doctors and other health professionals to West Africa, and to provide ongoing practical support such as the provision of medical equipment and supplies, and transport and accommodation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have Australians volunteering on the ground, and we need to both ensure that they are properly looked after and to expand their numbers by giving other prospective volunteers the assurance that they will also receive appropriate assistance. Labor has also supported the AMA's call to deploy the Australian Medical Assistance Teamsâ€”AUSMATâ€”that include doctors, nurses, paramedics, fire fighters and allied health staff who can rapidly respond to crises like this one. The government, however, has still not taken action in response to these calls. Instead it is falling to the community and to groups like SEAGA to step into the breach and to provide the sort of help that the people and the governments of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea desperately need. We cannot simply sit back and wait for the Ebola crisis to resolve itself without intervention and assistance from Australia and the international community. The idea that it is acceptable to hold back until it comes to our region is both dangerous and unrealistic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I very much pay homage to the hard work of Mr Isaiah Lahai, Ansumana Koroma and SEAGA in their organisation to give aid to Sierra Leone, and I also offer my condolences to Mr Lahai for the losses in his family. After fundraising $7,000 for the first container, they are now working on the next one. And until the Abbott government steps up and starts fulfilling its international obligations to address this global crisis, it is small dedicated community groups like the Salone Ebola Action Group Australia that we must rely on to undertake essential tasks and to provide an important part of our contribution to the international effort. Certainly though, it is not good enoughâ€”especially when the Abbott government did, in fact, support the resolution stating that it would indeed provide more assistance. In that I very much support my parliamentary colleaguesâ€”the deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek; and the shadow minister for health, Catherine Kingâ€”who have been calling for more substantial Australian involvement for several months. They have written to the Abbott government requesting immediate arrangements to deploy Australian Medical Assistance Teams to West Africa and to support other specialist Australian personnel such as doctors and nurses who are willing and able to assist in preventing the spread of Ebola.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is through the work that these shadow ministers have done that it was revealed at Senate estimates that the US and the UK, two of Australia's most important international allies, had asked Australia to give greater assistance over a month ago, and yet we have still done nothing. While the British are reportedly sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone and the US has dispatched 3,000 people to Sierra Leone, as well as personnel from South Africa, China and Cuba, the Abbott government is still ignoring advice to assist in putting people on the ground. So tonight I urge the Abbott government to put people on the ground, to join with its international partners, like it does on so many other issues, and to give the necessary support and help that is needed to end this Ebola crisis before it becomes even worse, but, more importantly, to give the support necessary to the people in West Africa who are suffering and who continue to suffer every day as they continue to contract this deadly disease and lose their loved ones.</span>
