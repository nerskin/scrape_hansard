                  <span class="HPS-Small">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation waste management facilities extension and upgrade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation is proposing to extend and upgrade two waste storage facilities at its Lucas Heights campus in New South Wales. ANSTO is Australia's national nuclear research and development organisation and the centre of Australian nuclear expertise. Its unique expertise is applied to nuclear medicine production, research into areas of national importance, including health, materials engineering and water resource management, as well as helping Australian industries solve complex problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The increasing domestic and international demand for nuclear medicines produced at ANSTO, as well as the need to decommission end-of-life nuclear facilities, means that ANSTO's available waste storage will be at capacity in early 2017. This is well before the date that the new national radioactive waste management facility is planned to be operational. To overcome this, ANSTO is proposing to extend and upgrade two existing waste management facilities at its Lucas Heights campus. The proposed works will increase storage capacity for both low-level solid radioactive waste and intermediate-level solid radioactive waste. As part of these works, existing active ventilation systems and electrical infrastructure will be upgraded and there will be minor refurbishments or equipment relocations to enhance waste management flow. As part of the proposal, minor roadworks will be undertaken to allow the passage of heavy vehicles to dispatch stored waste to the proposed new national radioactive waste management facility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The project was funded through the 2015-16 budget measure—namely, Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation interim radioactive waste storage—and is valued at $22.3 million, excluding GST. These costs include all development and delivery costs, management and design fees, construction costs, fittings, contingencies and escalation allowances. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, the extension and upgrades are expected to commence in mid-2016, with staged practical completion and commissioning from early 2017. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:05</span>):  I rise once again to oppose the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2]. I am adding to my first contribution on this bill in 2013. This bill was negatived in the Senate on 17 August last year, having first been introduced on 14 November 2013. Here we are again, revisiting a bill which, for more than two years, has not had the support of the parliament. As I said when I first stood at this dispatch box to respond to this bill at the beginning of this parliamentary term, Labor opposes this proposed legislation, which forces a return to the draconian Australian Building and Construction Commission. As I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ABCC is based on flawed—and often ridiculed—modelling. Its proposed powers are extreme, unnecessary and undemocratic and they compromise civil liberties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor opposed the introduction of the ABCC in 2005. It is in our platform. As I stand here today, our view has not changed. The foundation of the bill is rotten to the core. Nothing that this antiworker Liberal government or its $80 million political witch-hunt into the union movement has done has convinced us otherwise. Most certainly, the royal commission did discover some serious and unacceptable examples of corrupt behaviour, stealing from workers and obtaining unfair benefits. Labor have absolutely no tolerance for that conduct, as we have no tolerance for corporate corruption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Labor have always said, we will consider sensible reforms for unions and workers. We will consider, as we will consider later, sensible reforms for registered organisations. Indeed, in December we announced proposed reforms that we want the government to consider in that regard. But we will not support legislation that aims to destroy a strong representative of working Australians. It remains the case that we believe that whatever laws are introduced to deal with corruption must be universal. They should not unfairly target one set of workers. As a Labor government, we would never enact a set of laws to go after one set of employers. We would argue that is exactly what this government is doing with the return to the ABCC: unfairly targeting those workers in the building and construction sector. So we call it what it is: a determination to take Australia back to the ABCC, along with seeking to introduce a raft of other industrial relations changes since this bill was first introduced. We believe it shows an appetite to return to Work Choices, which, of course, is the real desire of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stand here today, that could not be clearer. Here we are, participating in a Turnbull government accelerated debate. Yesterday, in defiance of the usual parliamentary conventions, a procedural motion was moved by the government to go after the union movement. The contrast between the two major parties is laid bare today. The Liberals have spent all of their energy playing politics with a taxpayer funded $80 million royal commission. They have done absolutely nothing about the numerous examples—the thousands and thousands of examples—of workers being blatantly exploited at work. This week, Labor announced that a Shorten Labor government would put in place a suite of reforms to protect rights at work by cracking down on unscrupulous employers who are willing to exploit workers. We will stand up for middle- and working-class families. Labor will put people first, strengthening and protecting people's rights at work by cracking down on underpayment of workers with significant and increased penalties and ramping up protections for workers from sham contracting by strengthening legal protections for workers' entitlements and increasing penalties, giving the Fair Work Ombudsman more power to pursue employers who liquidate their companies in order to avoid paying the money they owe workers—not just the money they owe workers but the money they owe creditors generally.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to introduce reforms to ensure that temporary overseas workers are not exploited and underpaid and to ensure that there is a level playing field for workers in this country. We have seen some extreme examples, not just with backyard operators but associated with household company names, of systemic underpayment and I would argue corruption; 7-Eleven, Pizza Hut, Myer and Steggles chicken are significant companies that of course provide a service to the community, but something has gone completely awry when you see hundreds if not thousands of workers underpaid, and there needs to be redress. Yet here we are debating legislation that will have precisely the opposite effect. If this bill is enacted it will attack the rights of working people. For example, Nicola McGarrity and Professor George Williams from the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the ABC Commissioner's investigatory powers have the potential to severely restrict basic democratic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the provisions of these bills are more akin to a police state. Undemocratic powers are hard enough to justify in a time of war, let alone dealing with civil laws in this country's workplaces. I think this is a point that has been missed by many.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a body that, if established, would govern the civil jurisdiction. And I say as a former national security minister—and indeed a minister who had the Australian Crime Commission report to me—that of course there are times in which this country needs to have laws in place to deal with the most serious challenges to society and the most serious threats to our citizens and our nation. And we do, and Labor stands with the government on those national security matters. As you know, Mr Speaker, we work very closely with the government on such significant matters, and we also accept that there are occasions on which you need to enact exceptional laws that potentially deprive people of their freedom, because the threat is so great. Those powers should be used in exceptional circumstances, in times of emergency, in dealing with serious and organised crime or in dealing with terrorist threats to this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this body, if established, would be presiding only over the civil jurisdiction of the construction industry and broader than that, of course, because it seeks to broaden its reach into the maritime area and the transport sector, where there is an association with construction. We would say to the parliament and to the people that this is a disproportionate response. I do not condone every act that occurs by a worker or union in the building and construction industry, but I ask: what is the justification for applying to workers laws that we would normally confine only to potential terrorists—to allow these laws to apply to workers, and not just union officials? I say to the parliament and I say to the people via this place that these are disproportionate and excessive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a central tenet here: workers in the building and construction industry should be subject to the same laws that apply to other workers. This is consistent with the principle of equality of all persons before the law. So, I ask the question: why does the Prime Minister think there should be a different law for construction workers than for the director of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party? It is absolutely misleading for the government to keep referring to alleged criminal conduct to justify this bill. Remember, the ABCC, as I have said, governs civil law—not criminal behaviour but civil behaviour. It does not matter how many times the government refers, in the same sentence, to criminal conduct and to the necessity to revive the construction watchdog; it does not change the fact it is a civil regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The creation of the ABCC in 2005 was the first time in Australian history that an industrial-specific inspectorate had been legislated with such powers. It operated in a hostile, biased and coercive manner and did not pursue or investigate breaches such as underpayment of wages, phoenixing of companies and sham contracting arrangements or health and safety matters in an industry which can be very dangerous, where the number of fatalities is way too high, where the number of injuries is too high and where too many workers go to work and do not come home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The genesis of the former Australian Building and Construction Commission arose, as we know, from recommendations of the Cole royal commission. I notice Mr Cole has forayed into the public debate only this week. That commission, established by the Howard Liberal government, said the construction industry was supposedly characterised by lawlessness. The then minister, in his second reading speech, said of the report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It found consistent evidence that building sites and construction projects in Australia were hotbeds of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was what was said then. The minister was happy to repeat the royal commissioner's sweeping statements, but the minister failed to mention something in his contribution yesterday. The $60 million Cole royal commission, which consisted of 23 volumes, referred 31 individuals for prosecution. But it resulted in how many prosecutions and how many convictions? There was not one single criminal prosecution, let alone any finding of guilt. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than $60 million of taxpayers' money was spent on the Cole royal commission. It had lots of colour and movement, there were many assertions by Liberal members of parliament and, indeed, a Liberal minister, and it was again relied upon this week by the government . But that royal commission, with all of that expense, with the use of state powers, with all of those findings, led to not one criminal conviction of a union official or a worker—not one. People's reputations were destroyed. People were smeared. There were attacks on people's reputations which were never addressed. Yet not one person was found guilty of a criminal offence in a court of law. Out of this lawlessness that was supposedly rife, there was not one single criminal prosecution. How is it that the commissioner and the government can rely on the assertion there was 'consistent evidence', yet that supposed evidence resulted in not one criminal prosecution against a union official or a worker based on that evidence? It would be laughable if it were not so serious. Royal commissions are not courtrooms. The same evidentiary standards do not apply. Hearsay evidence, which is not able to be cross-examined and should not be relied upon in the way in which I believe the commissioner relied upon it, has been stated as fact. Likewise, the most recent trade union royal commission has referred a number of matters for further examination by authorities—somewhere in the region of 93.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's also not forget the most recent royal commissioner, Mr Dyson Heydon, in the view of the opposition, clearly had an apparent conflict of interest. Mr Heydon accepted an invitation to a Liberal Party fundraiser while he was royal commissioner. He then sat in judgement of himself because, we would argue, the then Prime Minister chose not to act. That should not be forgotten when the substance of the report is being considered. Whether the commissioner had a conflict of interest or not, there was sufficient evidence to show he was willing to help raise money for the government by accepting an invitation to a fundraiser event while he was royal commissioner. On the face of that, there was an apparent conflict, particularly given his own words, when he was a High Court justice, that any departure from neutrality or an appearance of neutrality should be sufficient for a person to stand aside. He did not even heed his own words when making the decision to continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He may have cleared himself but I would say to you, Mr Speaker, and to this place that in the court of public opinion, the credibility of this commission was irreparably damaged. The government does not like reminding the public and the media of that, but we would argue that he made a mistake, a fundamental error, in not standing aside. Leaving aside, of course, that apparent conflict of interest, we have said that the terms of reference of the commission written by the government was always going to lead to a biased outcome. The terms of reference, regardless of the government's commitments on their announcement in relation to cutting both ways—</span>

                    </a>  Thank you very much. The point in relation to this matter is that there is no surprise that this government has chosen—and, of course, it is in the actual speech of the minister, yesterday—to rely upon the evidence of the royal commission to justify the reintroduction of this bill. This bill cannot be debated without debating the merits of the findings of the commission—and I accept, Mr Speaker, that you would understand that—because that is the justification for its reintroduction. That is, indeed, the entire substance of the minister, who contributed to the debate in the second reading speech yesterday, and he refers, throughout the course of his contribution, to other royal commissions as well as the royal commission that has just been completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government wants to say that fewer than 150 persons being referred to for further investigations arising from two royal commissions is widespread lawlessness, what exactly is their definition of 'more than 11,000 workers' to have $22 million recovered in back pay by the Fair Work Ombudsman because dodgy employers ripped them off in the last year? Is this widespread lawless conduct?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is the government seeking to introduce legislation that would increase penalties for those employers ripping off workers? No, they are not. It is only Labor that has a plan to protect the rights at work of Australia's working- and middle-class families, and we would argue that this is a problem for the government. It is focusing on this particular matter but not focusing upon the broad problems that are occurring in the labour market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that is relevant to this debate is the manner in which the volumes of the royal commission are being used. Minister Cash has had different positions on whether, in fact, members or senators will be able to access the confidential volumes to consider the merits of this bill. Indeed, over the course of the last few weeks we have seen a multiple number of positions taken by the government in access to confidential reports. We would argue that that has been a very, very messy chaotic arrangement. The Attorney-General made clear, last year, that nobody would see the confidential reports. Then the Minister for Employment in relation to providing access to those reports said that some independent senators would be given access to a redacted copy. Then she said that those senators would be provided with an unredacted copy, and then she said the senators would receive a redacted copy. Then there was an offer by the minister to one member of the opposition and one member of the Greens to access the confidential reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a mess and it is entirely relevant to this debate because the government is relying upon those confidential reports to convince members and senators to support this legislation. I want to say a couple of things about that. Even with respect to the Cole royal commission, the government of the day did not provide those confidential reports to any parliamentarian, nor did the government of the day provide any confidential reports of the Costigan royal commission. This is unprecedented that the government would consider repudiating the recommendation of the royal commissioner in providing access to those volumes. This is new, and what I think not only is offensive, inequitable and transactional, is the minister's original decision to provide access only to those that she believed could be convinced and the government could then win their vote on the basis of access to those volumes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This does speak to the way in which this government is dealing with this matter. This is a serious matter. If the royal commission is indeed a serious body—and of course it is—notwithstanding the criticisms I have, if the government is treating this matter seriously, then how can it trade access to these reports and be so inconsistent in its approach to these matters. Further the undertakings that the government is expecting those members and senators, who might have access to those confidential reports, to abide are so oppressive as to not allow them in any way whatsoever to indicate why they may or may not have changed their mind after accessing those reports. One of the volumes is subject to a non-publication order, but the second volume is not, yet the minister writes to the independent senators as if the second volume has the same conditions as the first.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go to the fourth undertaking that the government is expecting of those who might access those reports which says that you are not able to—and I am paraphrasing and am happy to be corrected if it is in any way against the spirit of the undertaking—refer to a detail or even the nature of the material contained within the volumes accessed. If you cannot even convey the nature of the material,—and I understand and accept that names should not be disclosed and identities should not be disclosed—if you cannot even talk about the nature of the matters, then how is it possible for independent senators to explain to the parliament, to the Senate and to the people of Australia why they may or may not have changed their mind, and how could an individual member of a political party that is in the parliament convey to his or her colleagues why there might be a reason to take note of the material confined within the confidential volumes?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I make, because it is so pertinent to the debate about whether we support this bill, is this: the Cole royal commission's confidential volumes were kept confidential, as I have said, and so were the Costigan confidential volumes, but the difference between the Cole royal commission confidential reports and these confidential reports is that the Cole royal commission reports had referrals and findings that were kept confidential. There are no such referrals and there are no such findings against persons in these confidential reports of Mr Dyson Heydon, and I know that because Commissioner Dyson Heydon—at the time he was commissioner—made clear that it was the case in the final report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the volumes to which we refer do not even have findings or referrals at all, and yet, of course, the government seeks to rely upon the material, with a limited number of people being able to access it and, indeed, with nobody being able, because of the nature of the material, to even explain why they may or may not have changed their mind on such matters. We say that is very difficult for members and senators. It puts Independent senators in an invidious position. It puts any member or senator who accesses those reports in a difficult position, because nothing—not even a general conveying of a view as to why they may have reconsidered their position—can be expressed either in the parliament or, indeed, publicly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have significant problems with this bill—that is not unknown. I guess, in some respects, the reason why I am not going through each provision of this bill is that this is not the first time I have debated it in this House. It is not the first time I have replied to a second reading speech, and I did say, at the outset, that I ask people to also consider my second reading speech reply that I made in, I think, December 2013—that long ago. Our position, Labor's position, has never changed in that regard, and therefore it is important, given what has happened since and given the government is relying predominantly upon the royal commission's findings, that I go to those matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That they are offering to brief selected parliamentarians about a report which the government purports to rely on to justify this legislation is a contempt of the parliament itself and a violation of the system of representative democracy established under the Constitution. We do not believe that is the way confidential reports of royal commissions should be used. It is base, transactional politics. That is what it is. That is why the minister was overruled in cabinet and why then, of course, there was an offer to provide a very limited access to the opposition and to the Greens party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I wanted to make in my time allotted is about the disgraceful display that has been the government suggesting it is merely reinstating the former ABCC—that is not true. This legislation extends the reach of the ABCC into picketing, offshore construction, and transport and supply of goods to building sites. The minister says it in the second reading speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The definition of building work also includes the transporting or supplying of goods to be used in building work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is more than a revival; this is a greater encroachment upon workers than was originally the case. A re-established ABCC will have significantly broader powers than its 2005 incarnation. If you drive a truck or sail a ship that has building products on it, then you can be taken off; you can be called in—dragged off the street or out of a truck—for secret questioning; you cannot disclose where you have been and you cannot disclose the contents of those interviews to your family or to your lawyer. This can be an ordinary worker. You cannot get proper legal representation, because those protections are taken away, in the main, in this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposed body removes the current protections which require the director of Fair Work Building and Construction to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue an examination notice. In other words, whilst there still is a distinct and separate body that currently presides over the building industry, as we know—the FWBC—there will be no oversight. This bill will remove any administrative oversight by the AAT, for example. Think about this: before a police search warrant is issued, the police have to convince a magistrate of the need for the warrant, yet, of course, that would not apply under these circumstances. This bill is draconian. It is unfair. The Labor Party oppose it absolutely.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  Before I call the member for Bass, I would like to make a couple of comments in relation to the points of order. I have chosen to do this at the end of the member for Gorton's speech because I did not want to take up any more of his time. The member for Gorton made the point that the introductory second reading speech by the minister made reference to the royal commissions. It does so, and he is right on that point. I do not want to leave the impression of unduly restricting debate. That certainly is the case. My point was more that there should be reference to the provisions of the bill. He has adequately done that and explained at the start of his contribution how he was going to address that. I did not want to leave the impression that reference to the royal commissions need be curtailed when it is, indeed, in the second reading speech.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I call the member for Bass, he raised a point of order. I thought it would help to clarify for him and for others speaking in this debate the point of order with respect to the judiciary. It is a point of order that comes up pretty regularly in these sorts of debates. In relation to royal commissioners and the royal commission, they are not exercising judicial authority. Therefore, they do not enjoy the special protection provided for the judiciary under standing order 89 because they are, essentially, a creature of the executive in their role as royal commissioners. I wanted to make that clear so that there is no confusion throughout the debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="137174" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NIKOLIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2]. Let me acknowledge at the outset the important place of trade unions in Australia's history. There is no doubt they have made a most valuable contribution. Sadly, this proud record has been defiled by the militancy of a small group of corrupt, militant unions and officials, most notably in the construction sector. In doing so, they have betrayed their own members and they have damaged our industrial harmony and our national economy. It is also undoubtable that, in light of the compelling evidence presented by the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, no objective observer can deny that there is an endemic problem of industrial lawlessness in the construction industry. The royal commissioner's final report found there is a widespread and deep-seated culture of lawlessness among many union officials. Given the litany of court judgements and fines against the CFMEU and other unions for repeated and unrepentant breaches of the law, it is very clear that more substantial measures are required to change this poisonous culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Re-establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission is at the heart of ensuring this much needed cultural change. Consider, for example, that since 2005, CFMEU related unions and officials have been fined over $6 million for proven breaches of the law. Yet, instead of reflecting on the fact that they are on the wrong side of the law, the CFMEU has not been deterred from repeatedly breaching Australia's industrial laws. Far from being repulsed by this behaviour, when in power Labor and the Greens presided over the weakening and dismantling of the ABCC in 2012—in effect, allowing for this poisonous culture, this inappropriate behaviour, to enjoy even greater freedom of action. Labor and the Greens replaced it with a regulator that had significantly reduced funding and powers. The result was predictable. There was a return to the bad old days of a discredited industrial past: thuggery, intimidation, no-notice stop-work tactics, demands that union mates be employed ahead of non-unionists and an increase in construction industry disputation to a seven-year high. Who can forget the appalling scenes soon after the ABCC was abolished?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were industrial pickets and violence on the streets of Melbourne. Police horses were punched, kicked and dragged to the ground. Non-union workers, members of the community and businesses were intimidated and threatened. There was the violent dispute at the Little Creatures brewery site in Geelong with militant unionists making throat-cutting gestures, threatening to stomp heads in and threatening workers who wanted to get on with their work by saying that they were 'dead', and property was maliciously damaged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in the House yesterday when the Leader of the House, during the second reading debate, referred to unionists who had threatened people with 'Colombian neckties' at City West Water in Werribee. He went on to explain that the term 'Colombian neckties' came from the Colombian civil war of 1948 and involved slashing a victim's throat horizontally and pulling their tongue out through the open wound. It is appalling, repulsive, unacceptable behaviour that all fair-minded Australians will condemn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Gorton said that Labor oppose this bill because it has been in their platform since 2005. Let me trump that because re-establishing the ABCC was in our platforms at both the 2010 and the 2013 elections. We said that we would re-establish the ABCC within 100 days of the parliament's first sitting. There was absolutely no doubt in the mind of Australians about what we would do in this regard were we successful enough to gain their confidence and assume the Treasury benches. We received a clear mandate from the Australian people to clean up the mess in the construction industry, yet Labor and Green politicians have ignored the will of the Australian people and disrespectfully opposed this mandate at every turn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposition Labor and the Greens have voted against re-establishing the only regulator that was able to hold the CFMEU to account. Why are we not surprised when the record shows that the CFMEU has donated over $6.5 million to the Labor Party since 2007? The Greens received more than $500,000 in donations from the construction unions in the single year 2013-14. Despite the unwillingness of Labor and the Greens to act in a way that meaningfully addresses the corruption and illegal conduct of a number of militant construction unions, we on this side of the House will continue to put the case before the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue is important because the construction sector is a vital part of our economy. It is an industry that provides so many jobs for workers in small business, large enterprises and contractors. A healthy construction sector is absolutely vital for Australia's future prosperity. Weeding out the rorts, rackets and rip-offs from the construction sector is as much an economic issue as an industrial issue. If we allow unlawful, corrupt behaviour to flourish, the cost of construction will always be higher than it should be. Productivity will diminish further and additional obstacles will be placed in front of much-needed investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of budgets ago the government committed $50 billion to new infrastructure in Australia, and I am pleased to say that about $1 billion of that will come to Tasmania. For the Midland Highway in my electorate of Bass, there will also be $34 million for north-east freight roads, and a great deal of other much-needed construction and building work will be commenced. I want that building work, Australians want that building work and we want that building work, which investment promotes in our country, to be as productive and as efficient as it can be. Leadership is needed from this parliament, from the union movement, from employer groups and from other political stakeholders to act together to ensure that these important reforms are enacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main objective of this bill is to deliver an improved workplace relations framework for building and construction work to ensure that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. It is about cooperative bargaining arrangements instead of coercion, intimidation and thuggery. It encourages genuine bargaining at the workplace level. Perhaps most importantly this bill upholds and promotes respect for the rule of law. Provisions ensure that unlawful industrial action and unlawful pickets are no longer a blight on the industrial landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In highlighting the rationale for this bill, let me take this opportunity to thank and commend Royal Commissioner Dyson Haydon and his team for their efforts during the last two years. I know that many Australians will regret the aspersions that have been made against the royal commissioner, who is indeed a distinguished judge. It is undoubtable that the commissioner's findings have been distilled from 155 days of public hearings. Australians watched many of these hearings or, perhaps in some cases, the highlights at the end of each sitting day. There were also 46 days of private hearings and the evidence of over 500 individual witnesses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The findings do not make for pleasant reading. Justice Heydon revealed allegations involving multiple examples of bribery, extortion and blackmail in the nation's construction industry. His report made 79 recommendations relating to the governance of registered organisations, signposting the way that we can improve the management of construction work sites across the country and make unions more transparent and accountable to their members. The royal commissioner also made 93 referrals for proceedings relating to possible breaches of the law—more than half of those relate to potential criminal prosecution. Numerous examples were revealed of gross mismanagement and unauthorised use of union members' funds, grave failures of governance and a dangerous lack of accountability and transparency which has allowed corrupt conduct by union officials to go undetected or ignored. Despite all of this evidence, Labor and the Greens in opposition continue to argue against the need to re-establish a specific regulator for this lawless industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Gorton says these reforms are unnecessary. Let us test that logic for a moment: if the ABCC really was not required after Labor and the Greens abolished it in 2012, militant unions like the CFMEU would have complied with the law, rather than being fined on multiple occasions for repeated breaches of the law. This is a critical point: if the ABCC is so unnecessary, why did militant construction unions immediately resort to the same unlawful behaviour? This goes to the point of that entrenched culture of lawlessness that exists within parts of the union movement and it supports absolutely the need to re-establish the ABCC. The latest royal commission shows that, far from resorting to lawful methods, the CFMEU and other militant unions did exactly the opposite. In effect, those opposite appear to be saying to the Australian people that the construction industry does not have to comply with the law like everybody else. That is just not right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will help re-establish the rule of law in the building and construction sector. It must be fast-tracked to ensure that workers, subcontractors and much-needed investment in this important industry is protected. Re-establishing the ABCC will ensure a return to the rule of law in the building sector, ending the thuggery and illegality and further protecting workers. Workers in the construction industry, after all, deserve a safe and legal working environment. Members on this side of the House will always stand for honest workers and unions who want to see the criminality exposed by the trade union royal commission stamped out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our proposed legislation helps to restore the situation when the ABCC was last in existence: an environment of enhanced productivity, where projects were delivered on-time and on-budget, and there was a decrease in industrial unrest. We made it very clear in opposition that restoring the ABCC was a key policy priority—for which we received a strong mandate. It is time that Labor and the Greens respected the judgement of the Australian people and the incontrovertible evidence of the royal commission and supported us in re-establishing the ABCC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consider the findings of a 2013 independent economics report on the state of the construction sector during the period when the ABCC was in place. There was a nine per cent productivity growth in the construction industry, $7.5 billion a year in consumer savings and far fewer days lost to due to industrial action. The ABCC also acted effectively against the CFMEU's unlawfulness, resulting in over $3 million in fines in Victoria alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By refusing to support the restoration of the ABCC, the opposition leader is, in effect, putting his tribal allegiance to the union movement ahead of his duty to the Australian people. Thankfully, not all Labor figures support him. Paul Howes, the former National Secretary of the Australian Workers' Union, has warned that it is not in the interests of working Australians to be in a vicious cycle of industrial warfare. Paul Howes is right to see the need for higher productivity and more honesty in the union movement to make things better for working Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March last year, former Labor minister and ACTU President Martin Ferguson announced his support for the reintroduction of the ABCC. He is yet another Labor leader to 'bell the cat' on the dishonest campaign being conducted by today's Labor and Greens. Mr Ferguson rightly compared the actions of the construction division of the CFMEU with the former BLF and said there was an urgent need for the CFMEU to be brought to heel by the reintroduction of a 'policeman on the beat' in the building industry. Mr Ferguson stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The manner in which the BLF conducted themselves is now rife within branches of the CFMEU. The CFMEU should be brought to heel and required to conduct themselves in a fair and reasonable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Martin Ferguson, Bob Hawke, John Cain and others were Labor leaders of courage and principle, prepared to stand up against the thuggery and rogue behaviour of the building unions. How sad that the current generation of Labor and union leaders is unwilling to put the national interest ahead of their union links. Rather than condemn the illegality and thuggery, Labor and Greens politicians excuse the conduct of these rogue elements of the CFMEU, host them here in this parliament, and actively defend and even promote them. The message from Mr Shorten and others appears to be 'Nothing to see here,' no matter how dishonest, violent or corrupt the behaviour from the CFMEU is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say there is a clear rationale to re-establish the ABCC. We saw that on the front page of yesterday's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, with the former royal commissioner Terence Cole, whose work paved the way for the ABCC, arguing it must be re-established. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2]. In my electorate, there is a stretch of road known as 'the hungry mile'. It was 'the hungry mile' because the waterfront workers would trudge along it from wharf to wharf from the late 1800s right up to the 1940s. They depended on the whim of the foreman to be selected to work that day and get a day's work that would put food on the table for them and for their families. They had no certainty, they had no security and they had no dignity. It was the union movement that fought for and won decent pay and conditions for those men. Balmain—which was in my electorate, at least until the most recent redistribution—was the birthplace of the Labor Party in New South Wales. Working men and women were determined to use the powers of government to help people just like them get security, decent living conditions and a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Of course, I am very sorry to lose Balmain as part of my seat because I have always been very proud to represent the birthplace of the Labor movement in New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mention these places not just because they are part of my electorate—or were part of my electorate, in the case of Balmain—but because they are part of our history. They are part of the history of the Labor movement in Australia, the movement which, on this side, we are proud to be part of. We are here. We are members of the Labor Party. We stand for government as Labor members because we believe in fair pay and fair conditions. We know that unions have played a vital role in representing working people and in making sure that they get decent pay and decent conditions. Unions in Australia have fought for and won annual leave, awards setting out the minimum entitlements for workers in every industry, penalty rates, maternity leave, superannuation, equal pay for women, health and safety, workers compensation, the banning of the use of asbestos, sick leave, long service leave, redundancy pay and even lunch breaks. Throughout it all, unions have fought for decent pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An OECD study in 2011 of the causes of increasing inequality found that a decline in union density and union bargaining power was linked to increases in wage inequality. In fact, we saw that very thing in Australia under Work Choices. Annualised wage increases under union-certified agreements averaged about 4.03 per cent in the two quarters after Work Choices took effect, which was above the inflation rate at the time. Non-union employee certified agreements averaged 3.6 per cent, below the inflation rate at the time. Working people without a union's support and protection saw their pay fall in real terms under Work Choices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that is bad for the individual workers. Inequality is obviously not good for the people who are missing out, but it is also bad for us as a society and for our economy as a whole. Everyone, from the IMF to the World Bank and the G20, has been finding that economic inequality is bad for economic growth. This government's ideologically-driven attack on unions is obviously an attack on individual workers and their pay and conditions, but it is also likely to undermine our nation's economic health. Wages growth in recent years has been stagnant, while productivity continues to grow. This continues to increase inequality and it is hurting working people as they struggle to make ends meet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we are, as a labour movement and as the Labor Party, absolutely and unequivocally opposed to the sort of behaviour that the member for Bass was describing. Any threat of violence is completely unacceptable in any workplace at any time—there is no question about it. I would go even further. We have seen the reports of union leaders who have been spending member's money on day spas, holidays or shopping sprees. Those people are amongst the worst people I can imagine, because they are not just betraying their individual members, they are betraying a labour movement that has struggled hard for decent pay and conditions for ordinary Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When these individuals, who are supposed to represent working people, use their positions for personal advantage, it is the worst kind of betrayal. When people do the wrong thing, they should face every criminal penalty possible. If they have done the wrong thing, they should be charged. If they are found guilty and there is a jail sentence applicable, that is great. I have no problem with people facing the full consequences of their behaviour. That is why, when we were in government, we oversaw the greatest transparency and accountability reforms of registered organisations, including: tripling penalties for breaches of the Fair Work Act; requiring officials of registered organisations to undertake training to better understand their governance and accounting obligations; and requiring the disclosure of officials' remuneration and pecuniary and financial interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we have gone further and said that we also support making the Australian Securities and Investments Commission the regulator of the most serious contraventions of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. We have said we will give the general manager of the Fair Work Commission an additional $4.5 million for increased monitoring of registered organisations. We have said we will extend current electoral funding laws to donations and expenditure relating to all elections managed by the Australian Electoral Commission such as those for union elections. We will also, incidentally, always support and continue to support the reduction of the disclosure threshold for political donations from $13,000 to $1,000 as part of our longstanding commitment to transparency. It would be terrific if the government backed us in that measure, which would increase transparency with political donations. We have also said that we will extend whistleblower protections to the private sector, registered organisations and the not-for-profit sector and that we will double the maximum penalties for all criminal offences under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act and introduce heavier penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these measures are designed to ensure that, where there is bad behaviour, the people who are responsible are found, where it is appropriate, prosecuted and, when prosecuted, if found guilty, face all of the consequences of their actions. But we do not support reintroducing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The ABCC has powers that are excessive and undemocratic. If re-established, the ABCC will have coercive powers to compel workers to secret interviews. They can be denied legal representation and threatened with imprisonment if they do not cooperate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support tough action, but we support one law for all. Any crime that happens in workplaces by an employer, by an employee or by a union delegate should be investigated by our crime-fighting agencies—the police or the Australian Crime Commission—and anyone who does the wrong thing in the workplace should pay the price. That is why, on Monday, Labor announced our plan to crack down on the types of workplace exploitation we have seen exposed recently by Myer, 7-Eleven, Pizza Hut and others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will bring in significantly increased penalties for employers who deliberately and systemically avoid paying their employees properly. We will increase protections against sham contracting and give the Fair Work Ombudsman more power to pursue employers who liquidate their companies in order to avoid paying the money they owe their workers, and we will make sure that temporary overseas workers are not being exploited and underpaid and that there is a level playing field for Australia workers. No-one—no union leader, no employer, no employee—should be able to get away with breaking the law, and we have got a plan to ensure that that happens.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  The Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2], the associated Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 [No. 2] and the proposed government amendments in the Senate fulfil a 2013 election commitment to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The bills fulfil this government's commitment in re-establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission and, in doing so, ensure it maintains the rule of law and drives productivity on commercial building sites and construction projects—onshore or offshore. The Labor government procrastinated for five years before the then workplace relations minister, Bill Shorten, gave in to union demands and abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2012 and replaced it with a regulator with significantly reduced funding and powers. This bill will reverse Labor's changes to the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times we have seen much of the bully-boy days return and, in the electorate of Macquarie, I have been personally contacted by several contractors—mum-and-dad business people—who have experienced threatening behaviour, including physical threats and, I am ashamed to say in Australia, death threats. This is not the Australian way. This is not mateship. This is not supporting Australian workers—mum and dads. This is 'cowering down' to bully-boy tactics, and, as a government, we must strive to provide an environment which will enable honest men and women to grow their business without intimidation and threats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main object of the bill is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building and construction work to ensure that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. The weaker regulator established by the Labor government saw the removal of specific provisions aimed at addressing specific problems of industrial unlawfulness in the construction industry. With this, the current legislation, the Fair Work Building Industry Act, saw standards in the industry decline. This bill seeks to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which will put in place stronger laws of protection. It will introduce a new building code and new higher standards of workplace conduct on building contractors who seek to work on Commonwealth funded construction projects. This will enable equitable workplace practices that Australian workers should expect. Contractors that breach safety laws, underpay workers or breach migration laws will not be allowed to do Commonwealth funded work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reiterate that I have been approached in my own electorate of Macquarie about such behaviours, which are not acceptable. It caused the person, their family and those that they employ great stress and undue pressure that were not deserved. Bullying behaviours like this should not be accepted in our nation, nor should they be tolerated. We, as a government, recognise this and we are aiming to address it. Just this month, we saw CFMEU officials threaten to stop work on a Lend Lease project in Adelaide if a union flag was not moved to a more prominent position. This type of behaviour, I have to say, is unbelievable! Honest hardworking people deserve better and should not buckle to this type of culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill aims to improve the bargaining framework so as to further encourage genuine bargaining at the workplace level. Enterprise bargaining negotiations must be as harmonious as possible. They must be sensible and productive and should be tailored to the particular workplace. It will also uphold and promote respect for the rule of law and ensure respect for the rights of all building industry participants. The bill contains provisions to ensure that unlawful action, including unlawful industrial action and unlawful pickets, is dealt with appropriately. The bill includes the ability for the courts to impose significant penalties for individuals and organisations that participate in unlawful action. The bill will also provide effective means for investigating and enforcing the law. The Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will be able to exercise their power to obtain information quickly and effectively without being hindered by unnecessary bureaucratic red tape around the issue of examination notices. However, to ensure accountability and transparency, the use of these powers will continue to be reviewed and reported on by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The bill will also encourage productivity and the pursuit of high levels of employment in the building and construction industry. It will ensure that the government's policy to deliver the infrastructure of the 21st century is delivered on time and on budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will create jobs and investment by ensuring employers and workers in the industry can get on with the job of growing businesses and creating more jobs without fear of intimidation. Led by the commissioner, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, via this bill, will ensure the rule of law is enforced with all sectors of the industry. The commissioner will have the critical task of monitoring, promoting and enforcing appropriate standards of conduct for building industry participants and referring matters to other relevant agencies and bodies as required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition said in 2013 that we would fix this because Labor did not. With this bill, we are striving to do just that.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  It is extraordinary, but not surprising, that the first serious piece of legislation that the government has chosen to bring before the House as we open the 2016 parliamentary year is this bill. This bill was introduced—and failed—last year and reintroduced this year. It deals with extraordinary powers aimed at the Australian trade union movement. I say 'not surprising' for this reason: it has been the single animating force of every Liberal conservative government from the spat-wearing Anglophile prime ministership of Stanley Melbourne Bruce through to Prime Minister Menzies and Prime Ministers Howard and Abbott to attack those they see as their political enemies—the Australian trade union movement. So it is not surprising that the government has decided to introduce this bill as its first act in the 2016 parliamentary year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, however, extraordinary. I am mindful of some of the reasons that the minister representing the minister in this House used when he justified the introduction of this bill. He said that it is essential to job creation and dealing with the economic and social wellbeing of this country. When you look at the problems we are facing as a nation, you will see that we have a health system in crisis, driven by the decisions of this government, with $57 billion worth of funds ripped out of the hospital funding agreements that were negotiated in good faith with state governments. That money has been withdrawn, so you have Liberal and Labor premiers around the country screaming out, 'Our hospital system is in crisis and it will fall over if there is not corrective action.' You would have thought that that would have been a priority for the government to address as its first act in the 2016 parliamentary year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they were not moved by the crisis in our hospital system, then they may have been moved by the crisis in our education system. Next week university students will be walking through the gates of universities throughout the country not yet knowing how much they will be charged for their higher education degrees when they conclude their studies. The government has kicked the $100,000 university degree proposition down the road, presumably until after the next federal election, to spring that on those unsuspecting university students later. That is hanging over the heads of university students as they walk through the gates of their universities for the commencement of the study year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With school education you have education ministers around the country, of both conservative and progressive ilk, screaming out for certainty around funding for their schools. They are saying, 'Gonski got it right and we need certainty and additional Commonwealth assistance for the funding of our schools to ensure they are funded on the basis of needs.' You might have thought it would be a priority for the government to introduce legislation and corrective measures in the first week of a new parliamentary year. But no, that is not on the agenda either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A minister representing the employment minister might have thought that putting in place some measures to deal with the issue of jobs and job security for Australians—the problem we are having with offshoring, even of government work—or giving some certainty around penalty rates and take-home pay might have been a priority for the government as well. But no, that is not a priority. We have this false debate going on around tax reform. In question time yesterday we had the Prime Minister contradicting his Treasurer about what we are proposing to do in relation to tax reform. It is a debate without a purpose. You might have thought we would have some more clarity on that issue within the first parliamentary week of a legislative year. But we have had none of these things. These are not the priority for the government. It appears the priority for the government is the same priority that has animated every conservative government since the beginning of Federation, which is to stick the boot into those they perceive to be their political enemies—the Australian trade union movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We oppose this legislation. We oppose the motivation and we oppose the legislation. Whether or not all of those issues applied, there are some specific issues that would still move me to stand here at the dispatch box and oppose the bill that is before the House. Going to some of the specifics of the bill, we have had the shadow minister stand here and deal with some of the broad issues concerning the royal commission—the way it has been handled, even over the last week. The minister responsible in the other place seems to have created an issue over whether all sides of politics, all representatives, will have access to the full volumes of findings by the royal commission. Confusingly, surprisingly, that has become an issue over the last week. But I do not intend to make contributions in relation to those issues. I want to go, specifically, to some of the measures that are in the bill and talk about some of the issues that should be in legislation before the House but are not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We oppose the bill because we stand—and I have stood, consistently, since my entry into parliament—opposing legislation that does not uphold the principle of equality before the law and proportionality between laws. I will confine my remarks, for this piece, in relation to these particular issues. If you look at the legislation and its explanatory memorandum you will see that chapter 6 sets out the intent of the legislation, which is to eliminate action that coerces a person by applying undue pressure or discrimination. A laudable intent—indeed, so laudable that it was at the heart of many of the reforms introduced by the, then, Labor government when it eradicated the Work Choices legislation and rewrote the Fair Work Act. Julia Gillard was the minister responsible for that legislation. There is no disagreement across the aisles on the need to remove coercive or discriminatory action within the workplace by whoever is applying such action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you thought that was the intent of the legislation and, then, moved to chapter 6, you would see hypocrisy within it. It is worth reading clause 62 in chapter 7 of the legislation. It goes to the powers of the ABC Commissioner. It is important to remember that the ABC Commissioner is appointed by the minister. He or she is not a judicial officer but has extraordinary powers granted to them if this bill succeeds. Clause 62 makes it quite clear that it will be an offence to fail to comply with a requirement, imposed by an examination notice, to produce documents or information. It will also be an offence to fail to take an oath or affirmation when required to do so and it will be an offence to fail to answer questions. These are extraordinary powers, and parliament should be very cautious before giving them to any arm of government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been locked in debates, in this House, about whether it would be appropriate for the legislative arm of government to award these powers to the judicial arm of government, whether it would be appropriate to appoint these powers to a judicial officer, in a court of this land, to enable compelled evidence, in certain circumstances. I have heard many fine speeches that this is all about upholding the principle of the rule of law, but this proposition gives extraordinary power, to a Commonwealth officer, to compel people to give evidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget that there are penalties associated with failing to comply with an information notice issued by the commissioner. You might think that a penalty would be constrained to a fine. Extraordinary powers? Maybe there are modest penalties associated with it. But no, there are not. Look at the detail of the legislation. I am sure that most of those who have stood on the government's benches and spoken in favour of this legislation have not turned themselves to the detail of it. The bill proposes that a maximum offence for failing to comply with compelled evidence is six months imprisonment. That is extraordinary. I mentioned at the outset that we on this side of the House believe it is incumbent on a responsible government to ensure that there is proportionality not only within the law and offences it must attend to but also between laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You are a Victorian, Deputy Speaker Broadbent. You may be familiar with a case that occurred within your jurisdiction and attracted a fair bit of attention a few weeks ago. A person received a custodial sentence for—what everybody in this House would agree was—an egregious set of events. This is a man who was high on ice, we are told, if the media reports are accurate. He was involved in a domestic argument with his partner who was trapped inside her vehicle—he could not coerce her out of the vehicle. So he attacked the car with a chainsaw. This was, clearly, an attempt to do grievous bodily harm to the person inside the car. We are not aware of the motivation. You might be surprised to learn, Deputy Speaker, that this person received a custodial sentence of six months. This is somebody who engaged in behaviour that every person in this parliament would agree deserves a stern punishment, a custodial sentence. It is absolutely appropriate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare that to what coalition members are saying, in this legislation, is an appropriate penalty for refusing to incriminate themselves or somebody else: six months jail. You have to ask yourself: where is the proportionality? That is what they are seriously proposing. They are proposing six months jail for refusing to answer a question where the answer to that question might incriminate them. There is no proportionality. For over 200 years it has been an established principle, in common-law countries, that we do not support compelled evidence. And there is a very good reason for that. Usually the evidence is rubbish. Usually the evidence is unreliable. A person who is coerced into giving evidence, to whatever body it is, is probably not going to give the most reliable or truthful evidence. So, there is a very good reason that for over 200 years common law countries have put in place all sorts of structures to prevent these sorts of provisions within our statute book.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we have these so-called defenders of the rule of law, who want to stamp out lawlessness, seriously proposing that we enact legislation that will provide for coerced evidence and the failure of a person who is the subject of this coercion to give evidence under threat of a custodial sentence of up to six months. This is nothing short of extraordinary, yet those on the other side of the House are going to say that we are weak if we do not support it. Well, we do not support it, because we believe in proportionality. We do not support it because we do not have faith in compelled evidence, we believe in equality before the law, we believe in proportionality, and we believe in equality between laws, and this bill does not provide for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are on the subject of proportionality, let us look at the issues that they are not supporting: unpaid wages and coercion that occurs against employees in the workplace. These are the matters that should be within a bill before the House, not this rubbish that we are being asked to support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Innovation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I also rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2]. Surely a modern society such as ours—one that aspires to harmony, equality, the all-Australian fair go—would by definition deem bullying of any nature to be intolerable. However, a return to the bad old days of union thuggery and standover is exactly what has transpired with the Labor Party's abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2012. The final report of the royal commission into trade union governance and corruption reveals a litany of ugliness perpetuated on those honest, hardworking Australians who occupy the construction industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When those people who own or work for a small or medium enterprise wake up each day, genuinely fearing for the survival of their business, the livelihoods of their workers and in some cases the personal safety of themselves and their staff, something is terribly wrong. Abuse, threats of physical violence against individuals and families, personal and economic intimidation, sabotage, union black bans from the prospect of future work: how utterly dehumanising is all of this? Yet this much is also true: the construction industry in Australia provides many, many jobs for workers in small business, larger enterprises and contracting. The sector is critical to a productive, prosperous and internationally competitive Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government recognises the importance of an industry that is vital to job creation and essential to Australia's economic and social wellbeing. The antithesis of wellbeing descends when workers are exposed to atmospheric fear, threats, intimidation and reprisals, knowing that unless they yield to the overlords of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union an arsenal of bullying firepower awaits, potentially destroying the viability of their business and with that their very future and that of their families. These bills re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a proven, robust watchdog that will trump the weakness of bullies by maintaining the rule of law to protect workers and builders and improve productivity on construction sites, both onshore and offshore. The bills prohibit unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing, coercion and discrimination. Penalties sufficiently onerous to effectively deter will apply to breaches of these provisions. An array of other measures, such as injunctions, will also be available to the ABCC and those subjected to unlawful behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For background and for the benefit of members in the House, the shocking behaviour that blighted the construction sector for many years was tackled by the then workplace relations minister in the Howard government, the honourable member for Warringah, who in 2001 established a royal commission into the building and construction industry; the final report of that commission produced overwhelming evidence of the need for reform. The personal wounds—intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence—rode in tandem with economic suffering—project delays and cost blow-outs—which stifled investment and jeopardised vital infrastructure and Australian jobs. The subsequent establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005 quickly and unapologetically dealt decisively with the worst of it. It was a specialist regulator with teeth that went in hard and enforced the rule of law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the ABCC existed, building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually, and fewer working days were lost through industrial action. But the former Labor government, itself feeling the heat of its union masters, eventually caved in, and under the then workplace relations minister and now Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, the regulator was abolished. The bad days surged back: wildcat stoppages, militant protests, mates being hired ahead of nonunionists, and construction industry disputes escalating to a seven-year high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition committed to re-establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission to once again ensure the rule of law and productivity on commercial building sites and construction projects. At the last federal election the government was given a clear mandate by the Australian people to make this change. The central plank of these bills is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building and construction work to ensure that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively, thus benefiting all who participate in the building industry and the Australian economy at large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills will improve the bargaining environment to promote genuine negotiations, taking into account the uniqueness of each workplace. The bills uphold and encourage respect for the rule of law and the rights of all building industry participants. There are provisions to make sure that unlawful action, including unlawful industrial action and unlawful pickets, are dealt with appropriately. The bills enable courts to impose significant penalties for those individuals and organisations choosing unlawful action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will be empowered to gather information quickly and effectively, without the hindrance of bureaucratic red tape. However, to ensure accountability and transparency, these powers and their use will continue to be reviewed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The reinstated ABCC is not a corruption watchdog; it is an industry regulator, enforcing compliance with industrial and workplace laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps above all, these bills will spur productivity and employment in the building and construction industry. Industrial unlawfulness and breaching workplace laws inflicts billions of dollars in costs on the Australian economy and costs Australian jobs. The new laws will create jobs and investment by ensuring employers and workers can get on with the job, without fear of intimidation. We cannot allow entrenched unlawful union conduct within this incredibly important industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With all of the evidence of unlawfulness, the personal toll for everyday Australians and the cost to the Australian economy, those who do not support the restoration of the ABCC need to indisputably explain why. We need to do more in this parliament than members running into this chamber to protect their preselections and keep their union masters happy. We need members of parliament who will stand up for hardworking Australians and the right for them to participate in a lawful workplace, and for those reasons I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  There is a central tenet here in this debate, and that is that workers in the building and construction industry should be subject to the same laws that apply to other workers. That is consistent with the principle of equality before the law—a principle with which the now Prime Minister would have strongly espoused during his time as a lawyer and possibly even as recently as last year. The principles underpinning the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2] potentially jeopardise those goals of equality and the principles of natural justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we get out of the way one of the canards in this debate. The government continually suggests that this bill will in some way deal with alleged criminal conduct, but the Australian Building and Construction Commission as proposed would govern civil behaviour, not criminal behaviour. As shadow minister O'Connor said on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> last night: if you are going to fight crime, empower crime-fighting agencies. We have the Australian Crime Commission, flowing out of a recommendation of the Costigan royal commission, which is targeted at dealing with criminal behaviour. It does not matter how often the government refers to criminal behaviour in the same sentence as it talks about its attempts to revive the construction watchdog; that does not change the fact that this is a civil regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The creation of the ABCC in 2005 was the first time in Australian history that an industry-specific inspectorate had been legislated. It did not pursue or investigate breaches such as the underpayment of wages; instead, it operated in an aggressive, biased and coercive manner. It flowed out of the Cole royal commission. How history has a habit of repeating itself. The Cole royal commission—the royal commission in 2003—reported 392 supposed findings of unlawful conduct against employee organisations and individuals; not one led to a criminal conviction. The alleged breaches were technical breaches that had occurred up to seven years beforehand, yet that was used by the former Howard government, once they won control of the Senate, to justify their extreme industrial relations agenda.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor George Williams has been one of the most outspoken critics of the coercive powers that are proposed to be given to the ABC Commissioner, in particular section 62, which reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That power, Professor Williams points out, could be used to require a person, for example, to reveal: all their phone and email records whether of a business or personal nature; report not only on their own activities but those of fellow workers; reveal their membership of an organisation, such as a union; report on discussions in private union meetings or other meetings or workers. It could be applied not only to a person suspected of breaching the law but also to innocent bystanders—families, children of any age, other workers in the industry, journalists, academics. Indeed, a priest could be required to reveal what had been said to them in the confessional. A breach of section 62 is subject to a penalty—imprisonment for six months. As I said earlier, this bill does not tackle criminal misconduct; indeed, the only criminal misconduct dealt with in this bill is the failure to give evidence and somebody remaining silent, as would be allowed in so many other parts of the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection against self-incrimination is absolutely vital. It has been described as a 'cardinal principle of our system of justice' and a 'bulwark of liberty'. As noted in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Journal of Labour Law</span> in 2008, in Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd, Justice McHugh noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… that the privilege is important in preventing abuses of power by the executive in the exercise of its coercive powers. The privilege also assists by protecting the quality of evidence and by maintaining an accusatorial system of justice in which the burden of proof rests on the prosecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Justice Murphy said in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission, quoted in the same journal: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the privilege 'protects the innocent as well as the guilty from the indignity and invasion of privacy which occurs in compulsory self-incrimination; it is society’s acceptance of the inviolability of the human personality'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Williams points out that safeguards are absent. There is no requirement for warrants, not even from a judicial officer as is common in other areas such as phone tapping or from the Attorney-General, as per ASIO powers. There is no review under the Administrative Decision (Judicial Review) Act despite this even applying to decisions to ban terrorist organisations under the federal Criminal Code. The grounds of review excluded for ABCC decisions include: a breach of the rules of natural justice; procedures required by law not observed; making the decision an improper exercise of power; fraud has taken place; and power exercised in bad faith or an abuse of powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABCC powers lack the backstop of a bill or a charter of rights because Australia lacks precisely those protections, so removing such natural justice in this context is particularly concerning. It has been said that the ABCC bill copies powers found elsewhere, and there are indeed similarities given to bodies such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. But the context is important. It might be inappropriate to give to a body dealing with industrial disputes a power appropriately given to ASIC to catch corporate criminals. Indeed, as Professor Williams has pointed out, other regimes do not apply in a discriminatory manner. We do not give ASIC special powers to investigate the automotive industry. Other regimes do not suffer from the same problem of overly wide definitions and a low threshold for the use of power. The ABCC law applies a criminal investigatory model to a non-criminal industrial context. Indeed, while evidence garnered in an ASIC civil prosecution cannot be used in a criminal prosecution, that is not the case for evidence which is gathered by the ABCC. So evidence could be gathered through the ABCC and somebody could be required to self-incriminate and then could be charged with a criminal offence. This is entirely at odds with what occurs in other parts of the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has suggested that it is merely reinstating the former ABCC. But that is not right either. This legislation extends the reach of the ABCC into picketing, offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods to building sites. Indeed, the minister has acknowledged as much, saying the definition of 'building work' also includes transporting or supplying goods to be used in building work. That means that the proposed ABCC would be an even greater encroachment upon the freedoms of Australians than was originally the case, applying not only to building workers but to drivers and anyone else involved in the transport sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, Labor is serious about cracking down on instances of worker exploitation. Last week the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations and Lisa Chesters, the member for Bendigo and chair of Labor's Fair Work Taskforce, released Labor's plan to tackle serious cases of worker exploitation. These include Myer subcontractors employing cleaners on sham contracts, systematic exploitation in 7-Eleven stores, Pizza Hut delivery drivers being paid as little as $6 an hour and the widespread exploitation of workers by Baiada Group food processing factories, including workers being required to work dangerously long hours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have said that a Shorten government would crack down on the underpayment of workers, with significantly increased penalties for employers who deliberately and systematically avoid paying their employees properly. This would be done by ramping up protections for workers from sham contracting, strengthening legal protections for a worker's entitlements and increasing penalties. We would give the Fair Work Ombudsman more powers to pursue employers who liquidate their companies in order to avoid paying the money they owe their workers. And we would introduce reforms to ensure temporary overseas workers are not being exploited and underpaid and that there is a level playing field for all workers in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our package of reforms builds on Labor's strong record of protecting wages and conditions and cracking down on worker exploitation, and that contrasts with the government's constant attack on the conditions of workers. At a time when the growth of wages is at an all-time low, we see the government trying to take away penalty rates for some of Australia's lowest-paid workers and failing to recognise that penalty rates protect the weekend. Penalty rates protect the civic fabric of Australia by recognising that those who are required to work on the weekend should be appropriately compensated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us recognise this bill for what it is—an attack on unions. At a time when unions are under fire, it is vital to recognise the role trade union plays in dealing with inequality in Australia. Inequality in Australia is now at a 75-year high, and over the last generation the wages of the top tenth of workers have grown three times as fast as those of the bottom tenth. We have seen the top one per cent of earners' share of total wealth double and the top 0.1 per cent of earners' of total wealth share triple. And the richest three Australians now have more wealth than the poorest one million Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of this extraordinary rise in inequality, unions are the strongest social institution to fight against inequality. Work by Roger Wilkins and Jeff Borland has estimated that about a third of the rise in inequality in Australia is due to the decrease in the trade union membership rate. Unions mostly campaign for low-wage workers by arguing for dollar pay increases rather than percentage pay increases. Dollar pay increases benefits those at the bottom more than those at the top. Unions focus on instances of pay inequity across workplaces and across industries. Unions brought a critical case, a landmark case, for social and community sector workers who had been underpaid because their work was being done in female-dominated industries. That will see greater equality in the Australian workplace. The equal-pay cases of 1969 and 1972 were spearheaded by workers. Pay equality for Indigenous Australians was spearheaded by the union movement. The union movement worked hard to ensure a more equal Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a more equal Australia brings a range of benefits. Equality is good for mobility. Countries which have a smaller gap between the top and the bottom are countries where it is more likely that a kid born into poverty can make it to the middle class. One of the reasons why America is becoming an increasingly static society is that inequality has risen so markedly over recent years. By contrast, the more egalitarian Scandinavia is a more mobile part of the world. It is true, too, even if you look within the United States. Recent work by Raj Chetty and co-authors has shown that cities in the United States that are more unequal tend to be more immobile. So, even if you do not care about inequality, you should care about mobility, about the notion that the circumstances of a child's birth do not determine their life chances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inequality can corrode our policy. It can lead to excessive campaign contributions, skewing policy outcomes away from what the majority of Australians want. Inequality is fundamentally out of touch with the Australian fair go, which says that every Australian ought to have the same life chances and says that we are a country that does not much like tipping, does not have private areas on beaches and prefers calling each other 'mate' to calling each other 'sir'. Australians who believe in this egalitarian ideal should support the work of trade unions—organisations that have systematically fought for a more egalitarian Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No.2], and a related bill, for the second time in this parliament. This debate reminds me of an experience I had when I was about five years old. There was a television program on the ABC back then which was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Bill and Ben, the Flower Pot Men</span>. Bill and Ben were puppets. They would come out from the bottom of the garden and have their little skit on the program when the gardener went for lunch. I can remember as a five-year-old child watching that on the ABC. Bill and Ben would pop up out of their little flowerpots. I can remember being upset because I could see the strings on the puppets as they were being moved. That is exactly what I see today: I see the strings on the members from the Labor Party who come into this chamber and try to defend their opposition. The strings are being pulled by their union masters. There can be no reason why anyone in this parliament would oppose this bill unless they were acting as a puppet for a union master. When they come into this chamber and try to oppose this bill, I can see the strings being pulled by their union masters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw in the royal commission into trade unions recently the comments of the royal commissioner, Dyson Heydon. I think it is worthwhile quoting some of the comments about what he found in the building and construction industry and the union movement in particular. He said that corruption was 'widespread and deep-seated'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is clear that in many parts of the world constituted by Australian trade union officials, there is room for louts, thugs, bullies, thieves, perjurers, those who threaten violence, errant fiduciaries and organisers of boycotts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who are opposed to setting up the Building and Construction Commission are doing the work of those louts, thugs, bullies, thieves, perjurers and those who threaten violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not an attack on unions in any way. This is about the productivity of the nation. The honourable member at the bench talked about equality. I am thinking about the amount of wealth that is lost to this country—which I am sure the other member would like to distribute—because of the unlawful practices by his mates in the union movement. We were reminded of that yesterday by letter by Terence Cole, the former royal commissioner. He reminded us that, previously, the Australian Building and Construction Commission saved the economy up to $6.3 billion by reducing unlawful union action before it was axed by the Labor government in 2012. The honourable member from the Labor Party is so concerned about inequality in this country. I ask him: can he think of what could be done with that extra $6.3 billion in wealth that could be created if the commission were reconstituted?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He referred to the former commissioner. I quote from the article by Joe Kelly in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Cole said the abolition of the ABCC by the Gillard government meant that 'unlawful and inappropriate conduct was again prevalent' in the construction industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said it was taxpayers who would bear the greatest cost of this. He said it was $6.3 billion a year in 2012. We cannot afford the loss of this wealth in this nation at this particular time of our history, or at any time of our history, just because a few in the Labor Party want to look after their union mates, the union bosses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also consider what it does to our international reputation. No-one needs reminding of the scenes we saw last year. This was merely weeks after the Australian Building and Construction Commission was abolished—a shameful day in this parliament. We saw violence on the streets in the City of Melbourne. We saw militant union protesters intimidating the community and their supporters attacking police horses. We even had workers on the site, who were just trying to earn a living to pay their bills and provide for their families, having to resort to purchasing advertisements in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> with an open letter to their own union bosses asking for the blockades to stop so they could merely earn a buck to feed their families. Images of these protests were seen on television screens around the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country, we are competing for capital from around the world and to attract investment that will provide growth and create jobs. What message would it send to a potential investor who is considering investing millions, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars in the Australian economy to create jobs and wealth when they see those scenes on TV and think that the alternative government of this country, the Australian Labor Party, actually abolished the ABCC? What message does that send? What destruction of potential wealth does that cause? Those that oppose this bill should be damned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not about attacks on trade unions. Trade unions have always had an important role in our country and always will have in industries where there is a great concentration of power, where workers do need legitimate protections from firms that have substantial market power against them. It is important that we have a viable and lawful trade union sector. Trade unionists need to know that the money they pay in union fees, their hard-earned money, is being spent on lawful activity in their best interests, not in the interests of the union bosses. Sadly, we have seen what has happened over the last two decades. From August 1992 to August 2014, we saw a decline in trade union membership in this country from 40 per cent to just 15 per cent. So, members of the Labor Party, if you are really interested in strong and viable trade unions and you want to arrest the massive decline in the number of trade unionists in this country, you should be supporting this legislation. Otherwise trade union membership will continue to decline, because trade unionists—good, hardworking people who work on building sites, work long hours, start early in the morning and often do very dangerous jobs—need to know that their union membership fees are being put to good use and are not going to be used in unlawful and illegal activity. They should be the very first and foremost to hope that the representatives of the Australian Labor Party will support the reinstitution of this commission. But, shamefully, today we can see the strings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also an election commitment by the coalition government. We took this policy to the 2013 election and spelt it out in crystal clear language. Our policy was to reinstate the Building and Construction Commission. For that reason alone we were given an overwhelming mandate at the 2013 election to reintroduce this commission. Yet the Labor Party, with their mates the Greens in the other place, are attempting to defy that mandate—to defy the will of the Australian people. They are acting against the interests of their own union members that support them, all because, as I said, we can see the strings. They are acting merely as puppets for their puppet masters, the union bosses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the coalition government is committed to doing all that is necessary to reform the building and construction industry and to reinstitute the rule of law in this sector. The coalition government wholeheartedly believes that workers deserve to be able to go to work each day without the fear of being harassed, intimidated or subject to violence. We know that the former Labor government undermined and damaged confidence in the building and construction industry by abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We have seen a return to lawlessness, an increase in the number of days off work, and situations where work is simply not being done and billions of dollars of wealth is being destroyed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation we cannot afford to have a building and construction industry which is inefficient and unstable. The restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the code which supports its work is a crucial reform for the benefit of our nation. The contents of this bill reflect this commitment, and I commend it strongly to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:59</span>):  I rise to speak against the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2] again. It is nothing more than an ideological attack and a vendetta against a group of workers. This government is singling out an industry and a group of workers who work in some of the most dangerous workplaces in our country, where safety on the job and in the workplace cannot be underestimated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who are these workers that this government is calling thugs, as the previous speakers on the government side are? They are people who, when there is a workplace injury, are the first at the hospital. The groups of workers that I met with yesterday, and have met throughout my time as an MP, tell stories about how, when they are injured at the workplace and facing life-threatening injuries, when their families turn up to the hospital they are met by CFMEU organisers and officials. Quite often it is the secretary of their local branch. They talk about how the CFMEU are not thugs and how they are family, and how, when their family members are most in need, it is the union that is there to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also met with people who have tragically lost a partner—a partner who has fallen to their death or been killed on the site. Again, they talk about the family of the CFMEU who are there to condole with them, to talk to them, to offer counselling and to be there to support them. These are the people that MPs on the government side in this place are calling thugs. These are the people who this government is demonising in the media—people who get up every day to make sure that people who work on construction sites have a safe workplace and return home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safety issues that we have in the construction industry cannot be ignored. I note that many on the other side talk about the economic benefits from the ABCC, and I question their figures. But what they do not talk about is that, during the time of the ABCC, workplace injuries on our construction sites were up. Workplace deaths on our construction sites were up. This government is willing to compromise safety in our workplaces for their vendetta against an Australian trade union, and that is what it needs to be called out for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our CFMEU organisers and members make sure that their industry is safe, and I quite often hear from people in my own electorate: 'If it wasn't for the union speaking up about safety, I would fear speaking up myself. I'd fear being targeted and I'd fear not being asked to return to the next job.' In construction, your work relies upon the next job. So coming together and having that strong voice ensures that they are a collective speaking up for collective issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own area of Bendigo, we respect the work that the CFMEU do to support our local schools. Recently they held a Christmas party for the end of the year break-up. They kindly extended the invitation to Kalianna, a special school in my electorate. Every year they invite the students of the primary school division to come and enjoy a day. It is always a wonderful day for those students and their teachers, and every year the students look forward to it. Is this the action of a group of thugs? No, it is not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Construction workers, like all of us, have families, and, every time this government stands up and bags them out and calls them thugs, they are not only offending the people who work in the construction industry; they are also targeting their families. This government does not seem to mind that they are targeting an entire family. We saw, under the ABCC, some pretty terrible breaches of privacy and some pretty terrible breaches of what you would call basic rights—people rocking up in the middle of the night to try to find a worker and, not being able to find that worker, handing ordering notices to their partner. To be handed something like that on your doorstep suggests that your husband or your partner is a criminal—and that could not be further from the truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is standing up and saying that this is about getting rid of criminal behaviour on building sites. The ABCC governs civil, not criminal, behaviour. So this is another furphy that has been put forward by this government. Nobody wants to see criminal behaviour in any workplace. If there are threats of violence, call the police. That is what should be done. If there are threats and intimidating behaviour, call the police. Regardless of the workplace, that behaviour should not be tolerated and the police should be called. But do not come in here and pretend that the ABCC is about criminal behaviour, because it is not. Its whole purpose is actually about governing civil behaviour. It is about pursuing an ideological agenda. It is about trying to distract the Australian people from what the government is trying to do in workplaces, and that is to weaken wages and conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that this government likes to call out and criticise the CFMEU when they are the whistleblowers on some pretty shocking exploitation of 457 and 417 visa workers. Almost daily, we are hearing about more cases of exploitation of people who are here as guest workers, temporary workers, in this country. One of the first unions and groups of workers to be out there talking about this issue was the CFMEU. There are cases we have all heard about over and over again, whether it be the Irish backpackers being ripped off in South Australia and Western Australia or the Chinese and Filipino workers being ripped off in Victoria and New South Wales. These are issues that this government is choosing to ignore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the construction companies who are engaging in the exploitation of these visas happen to be Liberal Party donors. So that is perhaps why they are going after the union that has blown the whistle on the exploitation of these workers rather than going after the companies that have exploited these workers. In one particular case, through the Fair Work Ombudsman and the work of the union, almost a million dollars in entitlements has been recovered for those Filipino workers who were engaged here on 457 visas. This government is doing nothing to clean up the exploitation of temporary workers on building sites. If they were serious about cleaning up that exploitation, they would be introducing a commission that would look at the roles contractors and subcontractors are playing, and how they are engaging people here on temporary visas. We are not seeing that. Instead, we are seeing them go after the very people who every day go to work to make sure people get paid a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. They are about creating division in the workplace. They are not about creating harmony in the workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the ABCC was created, in 2005, it was the first time in Australian history that an industry-specific inspectorate was legalised. It operated in an aggressive, biased and coercive manner. It did not pursue or investigate breaches such as underpayment of wages, or safety concerns. It purely and simply investigated the behaviour of union officials, who, as I said, go to work every day to make sure that workplaces are safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the result of an ABCC is an increase in workplace deaths and injuries, then you should be ashamed. You should not be trying to bring it back into this parliament, but this is what this government is doing. They need someone to bully and they have chosen it to be the construction industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A further concern I have with this particular bill is that it sets out a separate set of laws for a group of workers we have in our community and economy. I believe there should be one set of laws for all, regardless of where you work. Whether you are a cleaner, a teacher or a construction worker, there should be the same set of rules for all. Singling out the construction industry just demonstrates how ideologically driven this government is. Why is it that this government believes that our construction sites deserve these special rules? Is it because they are vocal? Is it because they speak up? Is it because they are there and they see the pain and anguish on family members' faces when their loved one has had a serious workplace injury?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I challenge all members opposite to actually meet with some of these workers, to meet with the family members and hear first-hand their stories about what it means to get that shocking news that your partner has had an injury at work, or worse still, has lost their life, having been crushed or killed on a worksite. I challenge those opposite to hear the stories from the organisers about why they believe it is so critically important that they are there to support people. If we are going to have safe workplaces, to ensure that deaths and injuries are minimised, there needs to be cooperation between the workforce and the employers. In the past, we have seen that relationship develop with our good employers, ensuring that we have safe workplaces. But with this government and their green light, we are seeing that relationship start to collapse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular government vendetta against the CFMEU cannot be underestimated. Daily in parliament they love to tear this union apart—tear them apart and say that they are the devil and they are costing our country billions. It is just empty rhetoric and it is just not true. This government needs to do more to support a strong union movement, not less. This government needs to be encouraging positive relationships between workers, unions and employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this government's watch we are seeing a collapse in workplace conditions as major companies seek to outsource more and more of their jobs. So, rather than taking the responsibility of directly employing people, under this government's watch we are seeing more and more of these jobs go to subcontractors. People in the construction industry, like the cleaning industry, are made to get ABNs, cover their own worker's compensation and cover their own superannuation. They are made to work for an ABN, because that is their only choice. Get an ABN and become your own contractor and take on all the risk: 'I will not take on any of it, or you do not get the job.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the number of people who are here working on temporary visas and who have the same conditions, the workers feel like they have no choice. On the government's watch they are putting safety at risk, the conditions in our workplaces are becoming harder, and we are actually seeing wages go backwards. You do not have to be a genius to know that when wages go backwards people are spending less. It is actually bad for the economy if people are not earning a wage to keep up with the basics and the cost of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, rather than doing something to tackle the creation of jobs in our economy, that we have good, secure jobs that people can count on, and that we have a fair temporary migration scheme that does not see overseas workers pitted against Australian workers—that they are being exploited—we are seeing this government time and time again put legislation into parliament that goes after the very organisations that are seeking to support Australian workers and Australian workplaces. The language used when entering this bill was to threaten to go to a double-dissolution. Good on the senators in the other place for staring the government down and saying they will not be bullied on this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government does not understand is that Australians understand that construction is a tough job and it is one where there is high risk. I have just returned from Cambodia, where I was on a Save the Children delegation. The building unions over there talked about some of the unsafe practices they have—people who turn up to work in thongs; people without the proper safety gear; people who do not receive proper inductions on safety; people who are forced to work very long hours in unsafe conditions. It used to be that way in Australia before we had workers come together and form unions and campaign for safer workplaces. All this government is trying to do is pull apart one of the unions that make sure, as best as possible, that workers go home at the end of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have already been a number of deaths this year on construction workplaces in our country. Every year the Victorian Trades Hall has a memorial. Last year they put out a pair of shoes from every worker who had lost their life on a building site. They stood there with the families and had a minute's silence. They said, 'We will do our best to make sure there are not as many shoes put out on display next year.' These are not the actions of thugs. These are the actions of proud, compassionate people standing up for their fellow workers. This bill should be voted down and withdrawn.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  As we can see from the preamble, the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No.2] purports to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission in order to return to stronger regulation of unlawful conduct in respect of the rule of law within the framework of the construction industry. People here will not be surprised that I oppose the reintroduction of the ABCC. Like many on my side of the House, I have had a connection with the trade union movement. But it is not because of that that I take a strong view on this issue. I have two sons who work in the construction industry, and I will return later to some of their experiences which, quite frankly, indicate that we do need strong representation in industries like the construction industry—strong representation so people can stand up against injustices. Moreover, we need another set of eyes determined to look at safety issues in that industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I oppose this bill. The re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is an oppressive move. Its powers are extreme and the legislation is heavy-handed. There is the ability to conduct secret interviews and it provides for the imprisonment of people for up to six months for failing to cooperate. The commission has coercive powers. Bear in mind that the Building and Construction Commission is a civil regulator. We all talk about due process, and that is right. I participated in the debates about the Australian Crime Commission, and I know many here opposed the coercive powers given to the commission. But we supported that. We supported coercive powers going to a body designed to fight serious and organised crime. That body has extensive coercive powers—it can direct cooperation, it can direct the production of material, and failure to comply can render someone liable to imprisonment. We take criminal justice seriously, and that is why we supported those propositions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2009, in government, we supported extending the powers of the ACC so it had the ability to target serious criminals in respect of unexplained wealth. Those sitting opposite, and indeed the current Attorney-General, opposed the application of those powers—they watered them down so much that the power of the Australian Federal Police to prosecute serious and organised crime was rendered impotent. They did that because they did not want to impinge upon the rule of law. That shows you their view of the application of criminal justice and fighting serious and organised crime, but when it comes to fighting workers in the construction industry they say, 'We have a civil jurisdiction and we will vest them with these coercive powers—the power to command and direct attendance, to produce material and the ability to conduct secret interviews—but we will do it for one class of worker in one industry.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, I am a former trade union official. I certainly will not support people who are doing the wrong thing in any way. We do not support criminality, and none of us should. Whether it is unions or industry or a conglomerate of people acting inappropriately, we do not support injustice. The trade union movement exists because there is a need. It exists to protect people. Returning to my sons, both Nicholas and Jonathan work in the construction industry—a pretty torrid industry in some cases; there is no doubt about that. My son Nicholas was working with a fly-in fly-out operation in Western Australia. I remember getting the call the night that a person he was working with got crushed to death. Cutting corners has consequences. The idea of having a strong and committed set of eyes looking at workplace safety is not an industrial thing—that should be something that we all subscribe to. That is the experience of my own family. I have met with many workers and their families who have told me about similar aspects of their work. In many instances they are not who you would see as red-hot trade unionists—they are people who subscribe to the union so it can play a safety role and monitor and improve workers' conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation has been introduced by the same conservative government that brought in Work Choices not all that long ago. Many of us were around at that stage; many of us went to work sites. When I was the member for Werriwa I remember visiting a site and being told that workers were being paid less than the award rates of pay. Those sitting opposite, under John Howard at the time, made it legal for the first time in this country to attack workers generally and to pay them less than the award rate of pay. I remember talking about this to a director of this company, who occupied a very senior international sporting position as well. I got along with him very well, and I asked why he was doing this. In fairness to him, he said he did not have an answer but he would get back to me. He went to his next board meeting and then he rang me up and said, 'Chris, you are not going to like the answer—the answer is that we are doing it because the laws permit us to do it.' He said that, simply put, they were going to look after the people who own the company—the shareholders—and if they could use legislation to their advantage then they believed they had an obligation to do it. They got workers on minimum award rates to sign away benefits under individual contracts—it was either sign a contract or no job. They were being paid less than the award. All this hoo-ha that the government is not after unions or trying to suppress workers is fanciful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not all that long ago that we heard people over there talking about a need for greater flexibility in the workplace—'We need to do away with weekend penalty rates.' I do not know about the people opposite, but I suspect that they have people in their electorates, like in mine, who are working class people. These are people who are working to provide a home, to send their kids to school and to have a life for the family, and who are dependent on their total wage take, which includes penalty rates. People over there think that is very trite. They say, 'Saturday and Sunday are no different than any other day of the week these days. Workers in hospitality should just suck it up. Retail workers—well, anyone can go shopping at any time.' Where does this stop? What about our police, who I spent a lot of time representing before I came into politics in 2005? What does it do to the ambulance officers who my little brother now looks after in the HSU? What about all these other groups out there that have a role providing services to our community at unsavoury times—weekends, Christmas Day and outside normal working hours? They are all impacted. We see this as more than just an issue of another piece of draconian legislation coming from this government. This is now, as I say, a very specific attack on a class of people and on a particular industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly rail against singling a group out like this. I read about and was concerned about, like everyone else, what flowed out of the royal commission into trade unions. I was also concerned by the way it was all started—that it was set up as a body to attack the Leader of the Opposition. With some of the things that emerged there, you would have to say, 'They were wrong,' but let us look at someone those opposite actually took credit for—Kathy Jackson. I remember Tony Abbott, Christopher Pyne and others waxing lyrical that this woman was a heroine and a standout in the trade union movement. She was a woman who had dedicated herself to ridding the organisation of corruption. What happened to their champion—the one they held up? She was the very person who made the approach to the Abbott government about setting up a royal commission. She has been referred by the commission to prosecutors for possible charges. She seems to have committed a litany of indiscretions which pale into insignificance when you see what this legislation is trying to address. By the way, the commission did not catch her. If it were not for Brad Norington and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, she would have just flitted along. Bear in mind, she did say that the solicitors in the royal commission helped to draft her deposition, so she must have been regarded as being a pretty high quality, positive witness for them at one point in time, before <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper outed her. What about Michael Williamson from the HSU? He certainly was not caught by that royal commission either. As I recall, it was Operation Pendennis, with the New South Wales police using existing powers to find and prosecute criminality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This piece of legislation is to make good on the government's secret promises to employers: 'If you elect us, while we have already given a public undertaking that we're not going to touch workplace relations, we will do this. We'll re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We'll show you that we're going to be hard on workers.' This is their first big entry back into Work Choices. This will give coercive powers to a civil jurisdiction—not a criminal jurisdiction, a civil jurisdiction. It will give the workplace regulator powers which are almost unparalleled throughout the rest of our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are going to vest this organisation with such extreme powers, why is it that those opposite cannot commit to the retention of the Safe Rates tribunal, which was set up to ensure that our heavy-haulage road users are not subject to adverse price pressures from Coles, Woolworths and other major retail providers that put downward pressure on transport rates, impacting on the lives of everyone who uses the road? They are deathly silent about that. They are not going to talk about those issues. It is not that that is only in the interests of members of the Transport Workers Union; it is in the interest of every road user to ensure that people are not cutting corners, adopting unsafe work practices or tampering with the odometers on their trucks to circumvent regulation to drive additional miles at lower rates of pay simply to make a living. The government will not commit to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, they made it very clear that penalty rates should be on the agenda. They said, 'For retail workers and for hospitality workers, it's fair enough that you lose your penalty rates, but believe us—trust us—we don't mean it's going to happen to police officers, ambulance officers, nurses or anybody else who works unfriendly hours.' I know those opposite. I was about to say that they probably do not believe this, but they probably still do—once you start this, the thin edge of the wedge is going to proliferate through it. This is the beginning of Work Choices. They are being true to what they promised before the election. They said, 'Whilst we're not going to touch workplace relations legislation, we will demonstrate to employers out there that we're going to be tough on workers.' If you are going to be tough on workers, I think you should be tough on workplace compliance to health and safety regulation. You should be tough on compliance when it comes to overseas workers and the way they have been engaged and exploited in the Australian workplace. You should be tough on employers who have used, as 7-Eleven did, a contrivance to pay people half the award rate of pay. By the way, I do not recall anyone sitting on that side of the parliament getting up and commenting about any of those issues—any of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I oppose this legislation. It is only making good on election promises made by the conservatives. This is the start of Work Choices all over again.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="96430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EWEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I like the member for Fowler. He is a good man, and we should have more good men in this place, and I appreciate the pressure he is under to stave off the current member for McMahon and hold his seat. We think he should be a lay-down misere to hold the seat of Fowler and give good representation to the people of New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My basic philosophical position on this is that the Labor Party has never met an election promise to which they did not object. So the member for Fowler—who should be a minister—sits there and says that this is a surprise and that this is a contrivance by the coalition, yet this was a clear election commitment and issue. Tony Abbott, the then Leader of the Opposition, went to the election saying, 'One of the things we would do is we would bring back the ABCC. We cannot be clearer than that. If we win the election we want to bring back the ABCC to make sure that the construction sector has that strong cop on the beat to make sure that we are delivering safe and efficient workplaces without the interference of these thugs.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the worst part about the ABCC being rolled back is it was not rolled back because the construction sector was under fire, it was not rolled back by Labor because the construction sector was in disarray, it was not rolled back because the construction sector was working unsafely; it was rolled back because Labor had a philosophical position against it and it was their election promise—and it went through. We waved it through. So why don't you wave through our things?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main object of this bill is to provide an improved industrial relations framework for building and construction work to ensure that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the Australian economy as a whole. This bill was an election campaign promise from 2013. During the 43rd Parliament, the opposition leader Tony Abbott could not have been clearer with his discussions and his position on what the coalition would do should we win the election. And, hey presto, in September 2013 we won the election. We now hold the majority of seats in the House of Representatives and I do call on the crossbenchers to recognise that specific mandate: that we got elected with things to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From my perspective, what I would like to do here—for my people at home, to whom I will send this—is lay out the things on which we, on all sides of this parliament in both houses, should agree, and I believe that we all do agree. For the purpose of the exercise, I want to highlight what we, as a parliament, do and then what business does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my strong belief that everyone in this building wants the following things in our construction sector. We want safe workplaces. We want safe working conditions. We want a pipeline of projects waiting to be done. We want investors, both government and private, lining up to do business. Both houses of parliament want apprentices in jobs learning their trade and making their way in the world. We want jobs for people in the design, engineering and trades who want to build a career and a future. But everyone who takes up a seat in this place also wants jobs for people who just want to work. We want jobs for people who just want to get through to Friday so they can spend time with their family and friends. On this, I think we, as a parliament, all agree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare that to what my construction sector tells me at home. They want safe working places. They want safe working conditions. They want a pipeline of projects lined up waiting to be priced and won. They want the ability to make a dollar, to invest in their business and their community and to build a future for their family and their friends and the other businesses in the community. They want the ability to employ people who can provide the design, the engineering, the trades and the apprentices and the people who just want to work, who want to get through to Friday and spend time with the family and friends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big difference between the two is that if we do not deliver on this we still get paid but if business does not deliver on this no-one gets paid. When Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spoke about this yesterday, he said the ABCC is not an industrial relations issue as far as he is concerned, it is an economic issue. What we have to do is understand that the construction sector in our community is a huge economic driver, and everything we can do to make sure that the construction sector operates efficiently and to make sure that the profit is spread and the money washes all the way through our communities should be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to 2007, we had the ABCC in place and the construction sector was thriving. The Gillard-Rudd governments came in with an election promise to get rid of it, and as soon as they came in it was cleared off the statute books, and then all hell fell in around projects in Melbourne and around the country. There are stories in my city of Townsville where CFMEU officials will walk up to a bloke who is a sole trader driving a truck or anything like that and poke him in the chest and say, 'You'll never get the job here.' That is the sort of thing that is happening on worksites around town. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To which point, and running alongside this, in my city we are running a Tenders for Townsville campaign. Townsville, as a city, is unique in this country. We are the only city of nearly 200,000 people that is 1,400 kilometres is away from capital city and that has a viable construction industry and varied economy. The largest city in South Australia outside Adelaide has 23,000 people. Drive 350 kilometres outside of Melbourne and you are in New South Wales. If you take out the cities of Wollongong and Newcastle and Sydney, the next largest city in New South Wales is Wagga Wagga at 60,000 people. We are 1,400 kilometres away, and yet the same tender processes work across the industry in Townsville as they do in the rest of the country. It simply does not work in Townsville. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see the tender process altered to drive value for the taxpayer, drive competition and give my local contractors the best opportunity to hire and win work. If we can do that then we can drive those things there. In a city like Townsville we are getting fantastic support from the federal government and, to some extent, the state government in relation to the building of infrastructure around the city. The problem we have is that governments want tenders to be big—$100 million or $200 million. My local contractors cannot bank a $100 million tender or a $200 million tender; they can bank $20 million to $40 million tenders. If we can open up those things then we will be opening up opportunity for those tier 3 businesses—my small businesses. If the city of Townsville, the largest city in northern Australia, is to take that next step and be an important city in Australia, then we need our small businesses to grow into medium businesses. We need to be able to give our small businesses the opportunity to become a tier 1 or tier 2 contractor who can win these contracts and provide employment locally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing is that Lend Lease, Seymour Whyte or Watpac win the tender. They win the tender fair and square. They are doing nothing wrong, I want to be very clear about that. But the profit does not stay in our community; it goes back down to Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. The profit is what drives further investment. In my city, when it comes to the construction industry, we not only have trouble getting work for people who are not aligned to a union; we have a problem with winning that job, driving that commitment through, and providing the second and third wash of that money through our community. That is what the ABCC can do in my city of Townsville. We should be opening up the tender process. We should be making sure that we are doing the best possible thing for the taxpayer and getting as much competition around these jobs as we can. We should ensure that we are driving these things as well as we possibly can and getting the best result for the taxpayer. That is what the ABCC should be about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is talking about when he says the ABCC is not industrial relations to him, it is a huge economic lever. The construction industry is so vital to everyone in Australia, but nowhere is it more important than in Queensland. If we are talking seriously about the development of northern Australia, then we have to make sure that the work is being done in northern Australia and that the profit is being used to drive through more things for northern Australia. It is one of those things—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr EWEN JONES:</span>
                    </a>  Sorry, I am making the kids cry! Government infrastructure is hugely important. You must have the bridges, the roads, the sheds, the hospitals and those sorts of things. But what we need to do is make sure that the people building these things are the ones who are buying trucks and cars and sending their kids to school and buying houses and living in our community. If we continue to push down this line of not changing anything, of not being innovative in the way we deliver work and make sure we drive the best possible result for the taxpayer, then my city will not see the second and third wash of that profit from infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That goes for private as well as government work. At the moment, we have a situation where a large private employer has awarded a tender to an out-of-town provider. He has been pilloried in Townsville, as he should be. The ABCC is central to making sure that when a person goes on site—whether they are a large corporation, whether they employ 100 people or whether they are just one bloke and a truck— they are treated with the respect they deserve. That person is trying to make a living. That person has a family, a wife and kids at home, who are trying to make a living. If they do not feel comfortable going onto a site—or if they are getting pulled up at the gate and poked in the chest by someone who says, 'There's no job for you here, mate, because you're not a member of the union and we have the say over what goes on here'—that is wrong. That is un-Australian. That is unfair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to what business wants and what we as a parliament should be wanting. We want safe workplaces. We want everything that should be here. My small businesses are saying to me that, if they had the ABCC on site in Townsville, there are jobs they would be getting and they would be making money. You would not see the sole trader driving a truck on one rate and the other bloke on an EBA getting another rate. Those are the things that the ABCC can, and should, look at. Those are the things we need to do. That is hugely important in my city and hugely important to my region. My small businesses demand that the ABCC be a critical part of redeveloping the construction industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a baby up in the gallery that was crying before. It is important that, when that baby comes through and wants to get a job, they are able to get a job in a firm that is not a great big conglomerate but a firm somewhere in Australia that is able to do something and develop its own community. So I say: good on the coalition for bringing this forward. I am 100 per cent with Michaelia Cash, the Minister for Workplace Relations, on this. We need to get this thing through. The crossbenchers really need to understand this. We were prepared to fight an election on this—and we will do it again. But it should not be necessary. This was a central plank to our winning in 2013, and that should be respected. I thank the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  Not far from here, there is a great little development down in New Acton—the Nishi precinct. There is a couple of hotels there. There are restaurants, offices and apartments there. I think a lot of people would agree it has brought a lot of life to that little area of Canberra. But for Jason, who I want to tell the parliament about today, it nearly cost him his life. Jason started work on a job at the Nishi precinct when he was 21. We heard a lot from the previous speaker about people who just want to get on, get ahead and get a job. Jason started there as a young worker. And many young workers are a little afraid of their boss. You want to keep your income coming in. You presume that the other people around you know what they are talking about. You presume that, if your boss tells you to do something, they know what they are doing and have your best interests at heart. Jason was working with other people on that site. They were working in pairs on various floors and levels of the buildings. At one point the boss said to him, 'I want you two to split up your pair because we'll get the job done quicker that way'. Jason was not sure—he was a bit apprehensive, being new to the job—but he went up to one of the higher levels as he had been told. Jason fell several metres. He landed on his back and he broke it, and he lay in a hole for a couple of hours until people came and found him. Obviously, his fellow workers were distressed. Jason was taken to hospital for treatment. That was several years ago. He is still not working and fulfilling the dream he began—on that day back at that site—to become a carpenter, here, in Canberra and provide for himself and his family. It has been a long hard road to rehabilitation for him and he is still not fully fit.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who looked after him and who came and helped when he found himself in that dire situation? Was it the government inspectorate and the forerunner of the ABCC, the Fair Work and Building Commission Inspectorate, headed by the person this government wants to head up their new ABCC? No. It was the union. The union came and spoke to him, looked after him and got him back into rehabilitation. It is now helping him find a new job. It is not his ideal job but it has helped him get back on his feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the same story with Pam who lives in Adelaide. Last year Pam sent her husband off to work, one morning, and her last words to him were, 'Be careful of the scissor lift at work.' He was going off to work not on some small site; he was working on the Royal Adelaide Hospital site, a big government project. He did not come home that day. He is never coming home. He was killed by that scissor lift. Who came and helped? It was not the government department. It was the union that came and helped. In fact, the only response by the federal government's authority was to prosecute the workers on site, because a couple of months beforehand they had walked off the job and had said, 'We're worried about safety, here.' That was the federal government's response. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government comes along, here, and says, 'There are problems in the construction industry and we want more powers to deal with them.' Are they coming along and saying, 'There are too many people dying in the construction industry every week'? No. Are they coming along and saying, 'We're finding too many exploited workers coming in from overseas, working on $10 or $12 an hour or ABNs, and locals and apprentices are not getting enough jobs'? No. They are coming in and saying, 'We want you to give us more powers so that we can prosecute the very people at workplaces who are looking after the interests of people who turn up to work and do not come home at the end of the day.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many things we could be looking at if we wanted to fix up the construction industry. We could be looking at sham contracting, the practices whereby subcontractors—who are under a lot of pressure, sometimes, from big multinational developers—say, 'We'll give you a job but only if you pretend you're an independent business and come along with an ABN and look after your own insurance and holidays.' The government could be tackling sham contracting, but they are not doing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are they doing? They are saying, 'We want to attack some people who sit on the opposite side of the political fence'—namely, the unions—'and we will turn a blind eye to everything else that is going on.' How do they want to do it? They want laws, from this legislation, that will give workers in the construction industry fewer rights than accused criminals, fewer rights than accused terrorists. This is because the government wants to set up a new secret police, in the construction industry, that will have the right to take workers off-site and pull them in for questioning. They will not have the right to silence. They will not be able to talk to others about the fact that they have been pulled in for this secret questioning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a star chamber they want to set up. What is the supposed justification for it? They tell us the royal commission has had a look at the industry and has said it is necessary. We had a royal commission into the construction industry a few years ago. It produced a secret report that was full of claims of criminality. Do you know what? Not one criminal prosecution came out of the last commission they set up. They have set up another one because they did not get the answer they liked from the first one. This, too, 'has a secret report that is full of findings of wrongdoing and, really, you have to pass this legislation'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When they said that to us, the Greens, we said, 'Okay, show us the report.' The government said, 'No. We are not going to show you the report. We are not going to show parliament the report, because it is too secret and too important.' They came back, a couple of days ago, realising that was probably not a clever answer. So they wrote us a letter late at night and said, 'We will let you look at it, but only one member of your parliamentary team can look at it and they have to sit in a room and look at it. They are not allowed to take notes and they are not allowed to tell anyone else what is in it.' They cannot go back and tell their colleagues what is in it. I think they made the same offer to the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result, the government is saying, 'If you are a chosen person, in this parliament, we will let you see this report but you cannot tell anyone about it. Everyone else can take us on faith that what is in there is so important that if you saw it you would change your mind and vote for this legislation.' If the government really thinks it has uncovered systemic widespread corruption, do what every other government has done: come to the parliament and put the facts on the table. The fact that they will not shows us that they know the real situation. The real situation in Australia is that in the construction industry there are too many deaths and injuries. But they do not want to talk about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another truth they are hiding from. If you really want to tackle corruption in Australia do, at a federal level, what they have done in New South Wales: establish a national corruption watchdog, a national ICAC, that would have the power to look at employers as well as employees, that would have the power to look at politicians as well as public servants and decision makers. If you want to tell me that the only corruption that exists in Australian society is a few building workers and that the rest of the industry is squeaky clean, if you want to turn a blind eye to the fact that on this government's watch one large construction company has been reported to have given $300 million to Saddam Hussein's regime—where is the royal commission into that? Why are you not holding a royal commission into the construction companies that are bribing Saddam Hussein's regime? Instead, you are picking your political enemies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enough is enough. It is time to stop using royal commissions and claims of corruption to gain political advantage, in this place. If you really want to tackle it and you are really serious, you will get rid of this bill. What you would have, instead, is a national anticorruption watchdog that can look at everyone without fear or favour. That way, if there is wrongdoing in the construction industry they will find it—but if there is wrongdoing elsewhere they will find that too. And the public will know it is not a political witch-hunt. The public will know it is being done even-handedly and without fear or favour. But at the moment we cannot have that confidence, because this government has never seen a union that it did not like and could not wait to attack and has never seen someone's rights at work that it was not prepared to take away as quickly as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other parts of this bill also deserve attention. Under this bill, if there is a clause in your local agreement at the workplace that says, 'We want to make sure that young Australians get a job, so we are going to guarantee that there will be X percentage of apprentices on this job, so that young people can be trained up', they are going to be able to put forward a new code that will have the force of law that will say you cannot do that. If you want a clause in your agreement that says, 'We're going to give a certain number of positions to Indigenous Australians to ensure that they get a step up' or 'We're going to have some requirements about local labour to ensure that local workers get some of the spoils of international investment and the mining boom', you cannot do it. Under this bill, the supposed free-market government is going to have a seat at every negotiating table around the country and is going to be able to write what is in and our of enterprise agreements around this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And they are going to be able to say, 'Oh, well, you might have negotiated yourself some good conditions, but we don't think they're good enough, so, by force of law, we're going to take them away from you.' And they are going to impose a code under this legislation that says, to a subcontractor or a small company, 'If you ever want to get work on a government job, well, you'd better not promise to take on more apprentices, you'd better not promise to take on more Indigenous Australians, you'd better not give the union representatives the right to come in and inspect safety, because if you want that we're not going to give you any work.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, with this bill the government is actually going out and saying that, for all the infrastructure they are going to build, and all the big projects, they are going to use that to ensure that young Australians do not get jobs, to ensure that there is less ability to monitor safety at workplaces. As we know, and have heard time and time again—and the stories I have explained to the parliament today are just the tip of the iceberg—the construction industry is dangerous, and it is where safety should be at its highest. And we know that the people who have the strongest interest in ensuring that everyone who turns up to work comes home safely are the workers themselves, and their representatives, which include their unions. Those representatives should have the right to walk onto a site and say: 'We're worried that this scissor lift might kill someone tomorrow. We're concerned that if you split people up and we're not there to inspect you and keep an eye on you another young man might fall to his death. We're worried that without the proper laws we're not going to ensure that enough locals get jobs.' They are the issues we need to be tackling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of so-called corruption, if there is one silver lining of the government bringing this bill before us it is that it might start a debate about how we can have an even-handed national anticorruption watchdog in this country. That is why I move the following second-reading amendment:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That all the words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">“the House declines to give the bill a second reading because the objective of dealing with alleged wrongdoing in Australian society would be better achieved by establishing a broad-based national anti-corruption watchdog.”</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a no-brainer. If you asked most people in this country, 'Do you think that at a national level there should be a body that is able to look after everyone, including members of parliament, including public servants, including decision makers, including employers and including employees, not only in the construction industry but in every other industry as well, to keep an eye on them?' they would say yes. And if you said, 'Look at what happened in New South Wales when they had a state-wide commission against corruption that was broad based; look how it unearthed wrongdoing'—from Labor and Liberal, from ministers, from people who were making decisions and issuing coal licences, from people who were getting brown paper bags of money in order to influence decisions—'do you think, really, corruption is limited only to New South Wales and is not happening in the rest of the country?' they would say, 'Of course not.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, let's grab the bull by the horns. Let's stop the charade of attacking one particular section of society that just happens to be political opponents of the government, and let's use this as an opportunity to tackle corruption more broadly. The Greens, for many, many years, have pushed for a national ICAC, because we know that is what is needed, and transparency and integrity are important. I urge all members of this House to support the second reading amendment: ditch this bill, and let's get on with establishing a national anticorruption watchdog. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  I support the original bill—the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2]—in its original form. Before I get to the details of the bill I would just like to discuss some of the issues put forward by both the member for Fowler and the member for Melbourne. As probably one of the few people in this place who spent over 20 years getting up, putting on the steelcap boots and the high-vis shirt and on many days the hard helmet—I have worked on more construction sites than I can count, from farming through heavy industry through major infrastructure projects, as a tradesperson, as an engineer, as a consultant, in a range of different forms—I have to say: what a lot of baloney from those opposite. I have seen this firsthand. I have seen it from the time I was an apprentice right though to now: the toolboxes full of glue, the times you went back and found that someone had welded your locker shut because you did not agree with the union official, the times people went outside and found their cars with four flat tyres—originally, the BLF, those great bastions of protecting the people in the construction industry. I have to tell you, I have seen all of it, and it is absolutely appalling. This bill is absolutely necessary, in my view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fowler talked about worker exploitation and how the people on this side of the House had never done anything about it. Well, there is this small thing called Taskforce Cadena, which this government put forward and implemented—a multijurisdictional task force to address worker exploitation in horticulture. It is for those people who are out there who have been robbed by unscrupulous labour hire contractors; it is also for those people who look to exploit them to make more money. That task force is in place and active right now, and it was put in place by this government. Those opposite knew about this issue for many years. They were six years in government. What was the result? We had another review. We had another report. We had another pile of recommendations. But we are taking action, because this is a legitimate problem which is causing all sorts of major issues in rural Australia, in particular. For those people who are out there, who are getting paid cash in the hand, who are getting burned by people with phoenix companies, this legislation is addressing those issues and it is addressing them now. The perpetrators will be found, they will be caught and they will be prosecuted. I know of a number of those that are underway right now. I also know of a number who have operated labour hire firms and been penalised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Melbourne talked a lot about workplace health and safety, but he seems to dismiss or certainly does not recall that there are actually state governments in Australia and that it is the state governments which predominantly have the responsibility for OH&amp;S. They have enormous departments, any number of workplace health and safety inspectors and large amounts of legislation which they enforce. The difficulty is when you have a second layer with the federal safety office—but I will get to that a little bit later on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of a strong construction sector right now cannot be underestimated. We have gone through a massive boom. It is talked about as the mining boom; it is talked about as the resources boom. But the reality is that the majority of that has been a construction boom. There have been very large projects underway for many years. Most of those projects are starting to come to an end now. In Gladstone, for example, more than 15,000 people were employed on major projects. If you go to small towns in Queensland like Roma, Mitchell, Miles and Chinchilla, they had literally expanded so far that they needed extensions to their tarmacs on the airport runways. They needed new facilities. There were thousand-person camps in the district. There has been an enormous boom in the construction sector and we need to ensure that it continues, because right now in my home state there are tens of thousands of people, highly skilled people, who are sitting around unemployed. They need more construction projects, they need them to be viable and they need them to be underway right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission in 2003 found consistent evidence that the building sites of construction projects in Australia were hotbeds of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence. I have not been on many of them, but I can tell you that that is certainly the case—it is absolutely the case. As an apprentice, I can recall tradesmen who did not join the union being black-banned, because that was allowed back then. We have moved on. I actually went through the period where demarcation was addressed. It was absolutely terrible. There were tradespeople who had decided it was a good idea to teach me certain things. I would like to have been able to weld. As an electrician that would be a fairly handy skill, but in the workplace where I did my time that was not permitted, because an electrician should not know how to weld—that was someone else<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s job. It would have been incredibly handy for me at that time as an 18- or 20-year-old; however, that could not happen. I clearly remember tradesmen<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s tools being stolen. There was continuing intimidation. This stuff went on forever. It was just terrible. We need to address this, and the ABCC is one way to fix it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABCC, when it was in place, was proven to have worked over a long period of time. Witnesses reported criminal conduct, unlawful and inappropriate conduct, including breaches of relevant workplace relations and workplace health and safety legislation, and a disregard for Commonwealth and state revenue statutes. On 11 April<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>2015, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier-Mail</span>, that great bastion of the media in Queensland, reported that in 2014, 12,300 days were lost and that it was the highest number of days lost among the Australian states due to industrial action. This was according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. John Crittall from Master Builders said that the people who pay for that activity are consumers. The cost is passed on to the consumer. In fact, the CFMEU enterprise bargaining agreement adds an average of $50,000 in costs to every unit constructed. A one- or two-bedroom unit in a 10-plus storey apartment block within two kilometres of the Brisbane CBD will cost between $260,000 and $300,000 if it is a CFMEU construction. That same unit constructed by a non-union organisation will cost between $220,000 and $250,000—a difference of some $40,000 to $50,000. These are the things that need to be addressed. We need a strong construction centre because our economy needs it. We need more employment. I would certainly encourage the Palaszczuk government to get their hand out of the cookie jar right now and start to get on with the federal projects which are available to be built. We have massive projects available in Queensland. We have the Second Range Crossing in Toowoomba, with over $1 billion worth of construction. We need those projects underway. I am very pleased that the local member, the member for Groom, went out and turned the sod for those projects; they are starting to move. We need to employ tens of thousands of construction workers who currently do not have anything to do. This is incredibly important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, when the ABCC existed, an independent economics report on the state of the sector found that, in the building and construction industry, productivity grew by more than nine per cent. It is something which works. Consumers were better off by around $7½ billion annually. Fewer working days were lost through industrial action. So this is something which has been proven to work when in place—and it should be in place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard a lot of noise from those opposite about this being a union witch-hunt. I have read the recommendations from the Heydon royal commission. It is not solely about unions. In fact, in an article by Kara Vickery on 31 December 2015, she states: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A total of 45 people, unions and companies were referred to police or other authorities for investigation by the commission, including Cesar Melhem and Katherine Jackson.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of companies, she goes on to state that the report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… also alleges “adverse recommendations” about executives from large private companies including, Cbus, the Thiess Group, the John Holland Group, the ACI Group, Downer EDI Engineering Power Pty Ltd, Winslow Constructors Pty Ltd and the Mirvac Group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a witch-hunt about unions. This is about sorting out lawlessness in the construction sector. This is necessary. We need it to be in place. The ABCC will have the structures to do its job. It will change the definition of building work or modify it to include off-site, prefab or made-to-order components for parts of building structures or works. The reason for this is simply to stop the go-slow. You cannot construct anything if your product does not show up on site. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I moved through from an apprentice to an engineer, I did some farming and some other things. I eventually ended up with a consulting firm. At its peak, I had some 15 staff. I clearly remember the day when my business manager came back to tell me that to bid on a major construction project, to have any hope of being successful, it had been suggested to him that I needed a brown paper bag with $30,000 in it. I did not bother to bid for that contract. My company was not involved in those things. I have sold it now and it is no longer my asset. But I will never forget the day that one of my employees came to me and told me I needed a bag full of folding notes in order to get a contract. I was very happy at the time and I continued to work in regional Australia because it certainly was not quite as bad in my view. These changes will make a difference, and it has been proven. I certainly encourage those in the other place to pass this legislation because it is important to the nation. It is important that we sort it out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a whole list of examples. But the thing I would like to talk about briefly, as a former lead auditor and someone who ran a business who provided these types of audits, is the federal safety office. The federal safety office certainly is essential for Commonwealth contracts, particularly those ones that are only on Commonwealth land. Major construction companies need to have accreditation for whichever state they want to operate in. And if they want to work on federal government buildings and structures of above a certain value, they need federal accreditation. What that means is that, if you do not have federal accreditation, you cannot bid for that work. There are any number of construction companies in regional Australia that can do work of above $5 million. There is no doubt about that; they provide that service for state government contracts, local councils and private companies. But in order to provide that service for federally funded building and construction, under the current laws, they will need to be accredited through the federal safety office. The estimated cost of getting that initial accreditation is between $200,000 and $400,000 and the cost of maintaining your accreditation is between $100,000 and $200,000 every single year. The difficulty of course is that, if you are a small to medium sized enterprise who can do this work, there is no way that you can sustain that accreditation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would certainly encourage our government to reconsider its position on the figure of $5 million. We did move it from $3 million to $5 million. However, if you are a regional builder based in a regional centre, who employs local people and local contractors, it is almost impossible for you to win this work. You might end up doing it anyway, because a major contractor from a major city who is already accredited wins the tender, but what that means is you do not make any margin and that money leaves town. So that additional money, which you might have actually spent in the local economy or provided to your employees, leaves and goes elsewhere. It is not good for regional Australia. It is not good for the construction industry, and there should be more diversity. Quite simply, we should not have only a handful of large, major companies with the capacity to deliver federal government projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the regions, these projects are incredibly important because their value and the amount of money they can inject into the local economy makes a real difference to the people that live there. And not only that. They also provide opportunities for our local youth to get in and potentially get an apprenticeship or at least get experience on a major construction project that they might not get elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage our own government to consider this differently. The federal safety office is a necessary evil, but it is another layer of red tape and another cost for businesses. We really should go back to looking at this issue as part of our review of the Federation. Quite simply, someone should have responsibility. It should not be allocated to everybody. Once again, I can say from experience that, in order to meet the requirements for the state and federal accreditation schemes, there are actually areas of direct conflict—things which are exactly opposite. You need to have two sets of systems; it does not actually give you the outcome you might want. Reams and reams of paper do not make a difference to OH&amp;S. Having a certificate on the wall does not prevent someone from falling from a roof or through a hole or through something which is not covered or from being run over on a construction site.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think about how we address this. In my view, it is a state responsibility. They have the capacity and the legislation already in place. But it is something we need to think about. This bill is incredibly important. We need to get it through the other place. Once again, I would encourage those in the Senate to pass this bill. It is a good bill for consumers; it will reduce the costs to them. It will reduce lawlessness and lost time. It will certainly address both union and company issues within the construction sector; it is not just unions which are addressed by this bill. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  I rise today to join the debate on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2], as I did on 2 December 2013 in this place. I rise today for the same reasons I spoke about then. I am critically concerned about the draconian measures in this bill and the impact they will have on civil liberties in this country. I am also critically concerned about the impact it will have on safety, on justice and on fairness because this bill includes measures that remove a person's right to silence in an interview with this commission. It also impacts on right of entry for unions. It has extraordinary impact and is designed specifically to limit a union's capacity to work with their workers and ensure safety and ensure that workers in the building and construction industry are not exploited or put at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I rose on 2 December to talk about this bill. I have gone back and had a look at my speech from that day. One of the things that I mentioned then, as I am sure others have mentioned today, was how dangerous this industry is for workers. I mentioned then that, as a mother, I was critically concerned, as I am today. I would like to follow up on the previous speaker's notions in his wide-ranging speech that went to a lot of areas—many of them not specific to this bill, I might add. One of the things he talked about was unionised sites versus non-unionised sites. I would much prefer that my child was going to a unionised site. I say that as a parent who has had young sons in the building and construction industries who have come home from non-unionised sites with some very hairy stories about their safety being put at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, young people are sometimes brave. Young people with a strong work ethic are sometimes prepared to take risks that they should not take to get the job done. We have laws in this country around OH&amp;S to protect those young people, sometimes from themselves, but certainly to protect them from an exploitative boss or business that wants the job done in a manner it cannot be done under our laws. I want to make that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make the point that I was shocked this morning to see the number of Australian workers who were killed at work in 2015. The number from 2015 shocked me. The number that shocked me most was that, as at 19 January 2016—that is, three weeks into the new year—eight Australian workers lost their lives at work. When I looked at the total number of deaths at work in 2015, the number was a staggering 186. In construction, the deaths in 2015 totalled 25. I say in all sincerity: after listening to speakers talk about the costs in the building industry, what price those 25 lives? People want to come home from a day at work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is at the core of this bill. This bill is about reintroducing something that did not do what those opposite claimed it did when they put it in place. What it did do is breach what most Australians consider to be fairness. That goes to the notion of the right to silence. We all know the stories well. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, on 15 December 2007, a person reported that he was walking past a building site—he was not even employed on the building site—and was pulled in to the commission to answer questions without the right to silence, without the right to tell anybody that it had occurred to him. This is draconian. There is no-one on the other side of the House who could say that it is not. That is a breach of what we in this country consider to be fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand at citizenship ceremonies across the year and I am always struck by the notion of our strong democracy and by the faces of those who are taking their pledge to respect the rule of law and to respect the civil liberties in this country, and then I come to this place to find a piece of legislation that trashes those civil liberties and person after person tries to justify that in this place. What we hear in the threads is that, on the one hand, we have salacious smearing of the industry and of the union; on the other hand, we have an argument about productivity that does not bear in mind the safety of workers; it does not bear in mind the 25 lives lost last year. The right to silence is really important in this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had a wide-ranging debate today, but the debate actually started this morning out the front with the press. The member for Braddon fronted the press this morning at the doors and made a huge declaration: he suggested that no-one from the Labor Party wanted to come and talk about the ABCC this morning. He went on to use quotes that have been used in here about smears and uncontested testimony and went on to quote from the royal commission. Then, when asked by a journalist about what he thought it meant for the right to silence and how that stacked up against Liberal principles, he did not answer the question. He went back to talking about the royal commission and not the legislation. The journalist pulled him up again and his response was, 'I haven't really paid a lot of attention to that.' I would argue that that goes to the very point: 'I have not paid a lot of attention to that.' To what? To the measures in the bill? No. The conversation at the doors was all about the royal commission. It was all about the smear. He could not go to a critical element of the bill because of the obsession, the ideology that is happening, rather than the common sense approach that should be taken. Labor has already made announcements about making sure those things happen. The challenge of no Labor MP wanting to come out and talk about the ABCC this morning fascinated me. It is because we are in here talking about it, member for Braddon, like we were in 2013. In fact, in 2013, 50 per cent of Labor members stood up and talked about this piece of legislation while only 38 per cent of members opposite stood up and talked about this legislation or argued for this legislation. I note for the record that neither the member for Lyons, the member for Bass nor the member for Braddon were amongst those speakers opposite. They were not interested in the legislation then and they are not interested in the legislation now; they are very interested in salacious smears by quoting the royal commission. To me, that is what this seems to be about. It goes to the heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber we want to have a serious conversation about the future of work in this country. We want to have a serious conversation about the provisions that need to be put in place to protect workers. We want to have a serious conversation about things that were thrown up by the royal commission. On this side of the chamber we want to see corruption, wherever it appears, dealt with. On this side of the chamber we want to see all of the findings from the royal commission and have people referred for criminal charges where there has been criminal activity, and then let's talk about this sometime down the track. Of course, we all know that the previous royal commission threw up all sorts of smears that resulted in not one criminal conviction. If I were a betting man and not a non-betting woman, I might have rung someone and placed some money on what we are going to get at the end of this long, slow train.</span>

                    </a>  Good. I would ask this question in this chamber. We have had line after line after line of smear. We have had two former Prime Ministers dragged in front of the royal commission so that we could have some guff to say at the door—some salacious smearing to use in this argument, because you cannot do it with logic. You will not convince the Australian public that we need to take away workers' rights to be safe. You will not convince the Australian public of that, and you will not convince them by quoting your report, which you want to quote, about how good the ABCC was for productivity, because it has been smashed. It was completely discredited years ago, yet you continue to walk through the doors and quote it in here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the heart of our democracy. This debate is about the future Australia that we want to see. This debate is about how we are going to treat our fellow citizens in the workplace into the future. This government is proposing to segregate one sector of the workforce and create different laws for them. It wants different laws for those who work in construction—in this country, in our country, a country where, at every citizenship ceremony, we talk about the strength of our democracy. If it were not so serious it would be laughable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The case for this has been built on the most recent royal commission and the Cole commission. Nobody from the other side is coming in here to argue that we should reduce a union's ability to ensure that OH&amp;S happens in every workplace in this country. No-one from the other side is coming to argue how we should ensure that every worker is paid a fair day's pay. What we are hearing is a lot of rhetoric about how we need to be able to build things cheaper. I ask again: what price those 25 lives? These rights have been built up through a strong history of workers working together in a collaborative, collective way to mount a case to make our workplaces safer and to ensure that our workers are paid a fair wage. That is what this argument is about. So when I hear 'productivity', like a lot of Australians what I am actually hearing is, 'We want cheap labour.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, we on this side of the House have put together a package of reforms that will ensure that criminal conduct is detected at the earliest opportunity and dealt with by the full force of the law. That is not what is in this bill today. Core to our plan is making the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, with its coercive powers, the regulator of the most serious contraventions of the registered organisations act. On this side we have people prepared to get the work done. On that side we have an ideological war being driven by a need and a want to revert to a Howard-era piece of legislation. Labor has put together a package that will ensure that the future will be different for Australian workers and that, where practices are in breach of the law, they will be rubbed out. The General Manager of the Fair Work Commission will continue its role as the regulator with its current powers to conduct investigations and inquiries and resolve minor compliance issues. It will receive an additional $4.5 million for increased monitoring of registered organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we get down to the nitty-gritty. Let us fund the monitor to ensure that the right things happen. We will extend current electoral funding laws to donations and expenditure relating to all elections managed by the Australian Electoral Commission, such as union elections. That is real action to ensure that workers who are members of a union are members of a union that is doing the right thing. In line with our longstanding commitment to greater transparency, Labor will also reduce the disclosure threshold for political donations from $13,000 to $1,000. Labor will also protect and encourage whistleblowers by extending the protections that exist in the public sector to the private sector, registered organisations and the not-for-profit sector. That is real action, real ideas on this side, about ensuring that if there is illegal activity going on it gets cleaned up. A Shorten Labor government will double the maximum penalties for all criminal offences under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt in my mind that this legislation is about demonising the union movement and the government's political opponents. We on this side of the House will oppose it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="230531" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  It is a privilege to be able to stand and speak on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2]. It is a very emotive topic. It gives me great comfort to be able to stand and speak on this bill, as I spoke on it the first and second time it was introduced to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wholeheartedly believe that reform is screaming out to happen in this sector. Evidence that we need to see reform in the union movement, not only in the building sector but across the union movement generally, comes from looking at union membership across the country. Some couple of decades ago, union membership in this country was as high as 40 per cent. Australia needs to have strong unions. Australia needs strong unions to make sure that when a worker goes to work they have fair and equitable representation. So it saddens me when I look at the recent ABS statistical data, which says that union membership has declined to a figure as low as 11 per cent. We need to ask ourselves why. Why is it that so many workers who were members of a union no longer see the value in making a weekly or monthly contribution to a union? I can only assume that it relates to the findings of the recent royal commission. It used words like 'corruption', 'intimidation', 'thuggery' and 'bullying'. Ask yourself why union membership is declining. Put the other end of the spectrum together. I know the Australian Labor Party is motivated to try and rebuild their union movement. There is a vehicle for that to happen and I wish that it happens. I give all strength to their arm to make sure that unions do provide representation to members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in order to do that, we need to clean the show up. We need to clean up aspects of the industry. For too long I have seen front-page headlines in newspapers around the nation—for example in Queensland, where CFMEU members have engaged with notorious bikie gangs who, allegedly, are outsourced to strongarm either builders or members and coerce them into joining the union movement. That is not how you rebuild the organisation—by threatening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself pertains to improving productivity. Unions threaten that they will walk off worksites unless large sums of money are paid, under the auspices of training, to the union movement. Yes, we need trained personnel on union sites. As to the previous speaker's comments about the bill trying to water down occupational health and safety, I do not see that we seek to do that anywhere in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We seek to clean up an organisation which is screaming out for help. There has been negative press, and connotations around the country, as we have seen only too well with members of this House, and more recently with the Jacksons and the Williams—and the names go on, of those who have left a sour taste in the membership's mouth from the way they have conducted themselves in and around governance. In saying that, when that negative press was around there were unions that took that opportunity to put their own organisations under the microscope, and they have done that successfully. They have made sure that they are now beyond reproach when it comes to governance and the appropriation of union members' funds. But I would suggest that this royal commission and the findings that have come from it will add no favour to the CFMEU and the construction industry until some of these reforms are pushed forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time we have been here. I think the previous speaker mentioned that we have seen a number of royal commissions in this space—three in the last 30 years. One would need to ask oneself why. Why is it that this old chestnut is just the easy go-to? It is because it is the most public. It is the one that outrages or incenses the Australian public so much. As I said earlier, it is crying out for reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the previous speakers also asked: 'Why aren't we coming in here and taking on the big end of town? Why aren't we looking at trying to tackle phoenixing?' Well, last year we did tackle phoenixing, through the economics committee of this House. I think the recommendations were supported by both sides of the House, as to limiting those in the corporate world having a trading name, not paying their subcontractors and then starting up trading again the next day. No-one wants to see that type of behaviour. I will not take my foot off the throat of that sector, because it equally needs attention, and the House has given it due attention and will continue to monitor it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You need to ask why so many members on the other side of the House come in and debate so passionately from this position. Members from the government have alluded to the relationship that exists with some members of the Labor Party and to the machinations of preselection and to the close involvement that the union membership has in members having the privilege to serve in this place and to how much weight is given to the union movement in a member being elected to the parliament. And then you look at the line of donations that come from the union movement. I am not saying that that is a bad thing. But Labor can virtually take no position other than to rigorously defend this position because they see no wrong. In this House on this particular bill, you could make the assumption that Labor's master is not the Australian public but the union movement, which they rely on for preselection and to help fund campaigns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I want the union movement to be as strong as it ever was. Embrace these reforms. Help clean up an industry which is screaming out for attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister who has carriage of industrial relations has a close relationship with the CFMEU. So you can only make the assumption that there are additional motivations that bring people into this House to defend this position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard comments about 'salacious smears'. Well, I can recall countless current affairs programs and media releases about unions allegedly heavying builders and workers on worksites. I heard no-one from the other side make the argument that these were 'salacious smears' of their union bosses. But when we put forward well-thought-out reforms, brought about by the royal commission of Justice Dyson Heydon, he was attacked quite openly in the press by the union movement for not being even-handed—for being biased. Those claims as to Justice Dyson Heydon were unfounded. Evidence for his findings came from his commission and evidence to the previous inquiry, the Cole royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that the Australian public have an appetite to clean up this industry. I listened to this debate. No-one wants to see a dilution of the occupational health and safety regime in the sector, and this bill goes nowhere near speaking to that. This bill speaks to putting in tougher penalties. This bill speaks to working with the labour movement to rebuild what was, historically, a respected sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was constant evidence that the building sites and construction projects in Australia were hotbeds of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence. The final report of the royal commission provided compelling evidence of the need for reform in this industry. Central to the royal commission's findings was industry lawlessness. It concluded that the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the building and construction industry represented a significant departure from that in the rest of the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to some other comments that were made about why we are talking about productivity. The previous speaker mentioned that the only way they believe they could get productivity was by paying the workers less money. That is not what this is about. It is not about reducing the hourly rate, and nowhere in this bill does it speak to that. But, in its opening title the bill does speak about 'improving productivity', and that is why we are speaking about productivity gains. The productivity gain that hopefully comes from this is that, while the ABCC existed, the economy and industrial performance of the building and construction industry significantly improved. That is what we want to get back to when we say that we want to improve productivity. For example, a 2013 Independent Economics report on the state of the sector during this period found that building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent. Wouldn't that be an outstanding outcome that Labor could own: by increasing productivity on historical standards by no less than nine per cent, when the previous ABCC was in place?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But if you do not want to take up the challenge of productivity, the Australian Labor Party should take up the challenge for the Australian consumer, because the report also stated that during that period consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually. So, if you were going to build a high-rise and the union came along and allegedly said, 'Whatever you think your operational cost is, you need to factor in another couple of dollars.' The builder is then going to take that amount, whatever it might be, over and above the cost of the construction and direct the money to the union. The Australian public has had enough of that. They are sick of paying that additional cost—those costs that are unrelated to construction. We want to return to the days of productivity, where we can go to the open market and get a quote, whereby we are not just going to the market and dealing with those who have union affiliation. Seven and a half billion dollars annually, and fewer days were lost through industrial action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is committed to doing all that is necessary to reform the building and construction industry and to reinstitute the rule of law in this sector. The coalition government wholeheartedly believes that workers deserve to be able to go to work each day without the fear of being harassed, intimidated and subjected to violence—a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, without the fear of being bashed or intimidated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Led by the Leader of the Opposition, the former Labor government undermined confidence in the building and construction industry by abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which has seen a return to lawlessness and an increase in the number of days where work is simply not being done in the industry. Australia cannot afford to have a building and construction industry that is inefficient and unstable. The restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the code that supports its work is a critical reform for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a reform that I wholeheartedly support. I understand why those on the other side of the House defend their position. I wish for the Australian Labor Party and the union movement to become stronger as a result of this. But don't come here and pretend that this bill seeks to dilute workplace health and safety issues, when what it does, as in the naming of the bill, is seeks to improve productivity, to remove the lawlessness, the injustices and the thuggery, words that seem to have become synonymous with an out-of-control union movement. Union membership needs to increase. In order to do that, this bill becomes the building block for the Australian Labor Party and the Australian union movement to become stronger.</span>

I want to thank my colleagues from the Labor side of the House for their eloquence and their commitment to the rights and interests of Australian workers and their unions, as represented by their contributions today.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the member for Wright leaves the chamber, I want to say to him that I did not take great offence to much of what he said. It was a little confused and at one point I was not quite sure whether, as the minister opposite said, he might be seeking membership of the Labor Party, given his supposed support for unions. But then he made a statement about the shadow minister and his relationship to the CFMEU that was way out of order. I think he owes the shadow minister an apology, because if he knew the shadow minister at all he would understand that he is a man of great integrity, and to slight him in the way you have done is, I think, wrong.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pull you up for a moment, if I may, on the issue of productivity. I hope you have read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> for this legislation. If not, I hope you will.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It then goes on to have a discussion about the Econtech modelling and the conclusions reached by Econtech, and admissions by Econtech, with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> quoting this statement from Econtech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the original 2007 Econtech Report, some data was inadvertently juxtaposed in extracting it from … hard copy publications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> then states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This made a big difference to the findings, virtually obviating the change that had been found.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice Wilcox said that the Econtech report was 'deeply flawed and should be disregarded'. There is no conclusive evidence of an increase in productivity as a result of having the ABCC previously—none. So I suggest that, whilst it is okay to stand up here and make assertions, they need to be based on some evidence and some facts. The evidence and the facts do not support the arguments that those opposite have made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the contributions made by government members largely demonstrate their ideological fixation with attacking Australian workers and their unions. They have a blinkered vision when it comes to acknowledging the value of unions, their historical significance and, indeed, their current importance. Their determination to divide, vilify, victimise, attack and undermine Australian workers is very clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke on the previous legislation in 2013 and said at the time that the bill was about attacking the rights of Australian workers and their organisations. I said that the ABCC's proposed powers were extreme, unnecessary, undemocratic and would compromise civil liberties. My view has not changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This current legislation would increase the coercive powers of a new proposed ABBA. For example, the legislation has removed the oversight of the AAT in relation to the specified actions of the ABC Commissioner. The coercive and discriminatory nature of the legislation can only be condemned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am reminded of the words of Nicola McGarrity and Professor George Williams from the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales in commenting on the legislation. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the ABC Commissioner's investigatory powers have the potential to severely restrict basic democratic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The conclusion of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> from the 2013 legislation is instructive. I will take the liberty of quoting from it. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill not only repeals the FWBI Act and re-establishes the ABCC, it enlarges both its jurisdictional and industry sector application. It also provides new coercive powers (with retrospective operation), re-introduces a number of criminal and civil penalty offences previously contained in the BCII Act, and introduces a new civil penalty offence of unlawful picketing. It provides for penalties for building industry participants which are considerably higher than those available under the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In effect, the Bill creates (in relation to industrial action and picketing) a new and different set of industrial relations rules that apply only to persons associated with the building and construction industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There we have it. It is deliberately targeting, in a discriminatory way, workers in one sector of the economy. Not only should they not be attacking those workers in any event but, as we know, this is built on evidence from the most recent royal commission. We argue—I think, validly—that it was a political stunt, that the commissioner was biased and that the findings, although we accept them, were in large part very questionable. I certainly accept that where people act in a way which is inappropriate, either by threatening violence or using violence, they are matters which should be taken to the criminal courts. I absolutely do. Everyone on this side of the parliament accepts that violent or threatening behaviour is totally unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worthwhile pointing out what the coercive powers in this bill are. This bill provides that the commissioner can require a person to: give information or produce documents to the ABC Commissioner; attend an examination before the ABC Commissioner; and answer questions or provide information under oath or affirmation. In addition, where amongst other reasons an inspector reasonably believes that the act, a designated building law or the building code is being breached, they can: enter a premises without force; require a person to provide their name and address; inspect any work, process or object; interview any person; require a person to provide a record or document; inspect and make copies of records or documents; or take samples of any goods or substances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains a number of criminal offences similar to those contained in section 52 of the FW(BI) Act which are punishable by six months imprisonment if you do not comply with an examination notice to provide information, produce a document, attend an examination to answer questions, take an oath or affirmation, or answer questions during that examination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is simply unprecedented. We are a modern, democratic nation. We have a Prime Minister who likes to regard himself as being fleet-footed and progressive. But here we are seeing him picking up on this Abbott inspired legislation. It is retrogressive and punitive legislation, targeting one section of the Australian community. How can the Prime Minister of this country, in all good conscience and given his progressive values—those that he pronounces on an almost daily basis—on the one hand say what a good bloke he is and yet, in the very next breath, support this pernicious, unjustifiable interfering legislation which criminalises people who should not be criminalised?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cole royal commission, which was the basis for the original legislation—with $60 million of expenditure and 23 volumes—referred 31 individuals for prosecution and there was not one single criminal prosecution, let alone any finding of guilt; not one. So what sort of house of cards is this stuff built on? It is tawdry. It is a very tawdry act by a government who is going to extremes when there is no need to. There are ways, using the Australian Crime Commission, the criminal law and the various jurisdictions across this country, to address the sorts of behaviours that the government say are widespread—which, by evidence, are not. The fact is that the vast majority of Australian workers, when they go to their worksite on a building site around this country, act appropriately, do a hard day's work and expect a fair day's pay and expect their working conditions are such that their health and safety are being protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we know is that the ABCC is not impartial. As I said the last time I spoke on this in the House, Professor David Peetz said of the ABCC:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The culture of the ABCC is not and has never been impartial. It has concerned itself almost exclusively with transgressions by unions, or by employers who have facilitated or acquiesced to transgressions by unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If it is going to haul before the courts a union member who refuses to tell them about what happened at a meeting to discuss safety breaches by the employer, it must also haul before the courts the employers who breached the safety laws in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lalor talked about fatalities in the building industry. It is again instructive to note Professor Peetz, when he talks about fatalities in the building and construction industry during the time the ABCC was in existence. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There were 36 fatalities in the construction industry in 2007-08, twice as many as in 2004-05, immediately before the ABCC commenced operations in late 2005. Under the ABCC, construction became the industry with the highest number of deaths. As observance with occupational safety tends to be lower where unions are weaker, this trend is not surprising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is the guts of this. This legislation is designed to attack the strength of unions on building sites around this country and prevent them from looking after and protecting the rights of the workers, their members—opening workers up to the abuse that was evidenced by the increase in fatalities the last time the ABCC was in existence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no excuse for this, and the government should be condemned for even contemplating putting this legislation back in the parliament. They say they are willing to go to a double dissolution about this stuff. Well, so am I. I would happily argue this up hill and down dale on every corner of Australia, because I know what Australian people think about fairness and equity and about the right to live in a safe working environment in a democratic country and not be abused by the way in which the government proposes to abuse them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It cannot be said that Labor is not wanting reform. As the Leader of the Opposition and the minister responsible have pointed out most recently, we have an obligation in this place to look after the interests of all Australians, regardless of where they are and regardless of where they work. This particular piece of legislation is targeting a particular group of people, one sector of the economy, with the sole objective of undermining their rights in the workplace. It is not reasonable. It is not fair. And it is not acceptable.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  The Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2] is a critical bill for the development of a stronger Australian economy. It is really vital that we pass this bill and the Australian Building and Construction Commission re-established. I will ask for a bit of indulgence to recall how it came into being and how it was sidelined some years after its very successful introduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This all came to pass after the Cole royal commission that started back in 2001. It dissected and displayed, for all to see, endemic corruption and lawlessness in the building and construction industry. Out of that very thorough and extensive Cole royal commission came the creation of the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005. It basically reintroduced strong regulation into the building and construction industry but also the rule of law. Within two years, estimates published in many publications documented savings and productivity gains of $3.1 billion to the Australian economy per year. By 2012, the Master Builders Association estimated that that was at least $6.3 billion per year in productivity gains. I have seen other estimates in the literature, while researching this speech, of $7½ billion per year by the time the ABCC was abolished. So entrenched and unlawful corporate and union actions were very successfully addressed by the creation of the ABCC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very disappointed that it was watered down and the Fair Work building inspectorate came in to replace it, with a 30 per cent reduction in staffing and funds and a weakening of the regulations and outcomes. Instead of productivity gains of nine per cent per year, over the subsequent four years we have seen—as outlined recently so clinically in the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption run by Justice Dyson Heydon—a return to the bad old days. In the evidence that was presented we heard of intimidation, bribes, secret commissions, standover tactics and blockades, and I accentuate that it was evidence, because there were rules of evidence applied as in other judicial situations. There was endemic corruption in all states and in many industries. I thoroughly support the reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission as a regulator of workplace relations, because it has the runs on the board.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous speakers have queried how we can justify doing this. The answer is that we have campaigned on this through two general elections. In 2010 and 2013 it was stated ad nauseam that a coalition government, if re-elected, would reintroduce the Australian Building and Construction Commission. What bigger mandate can you have than taking this issue to two general elections? Unfortunately, people on the other side are in denial. I fear that they are, as usual, being unduly influenced by some of the unions who have had their malfeasance, inappropriateness and lawlessness on display in the trade union royal commission. Not only have we seen its veracity and legitimacy questioned; we have seen a campaign run over 12 months where they tried to destroy the reputation of Justice Dyson Heydon. By association they tried to sully the findings. But, as I have mentioned, the most recent royal commission is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of collecting the evidence. And what do we have as a result of that? There were 93 referrals to undertake civil and criminal proceedings in the Fair Work Commission, ASIC, ACCC or the directors of public prosecutions in various states and territories around the country. That is even worse than what was on display in the Cole royal commission, which lifted the lid on the same problems. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the same problems coming back again, and our economy cannot afford the lack of productivity. Whether it is building skyscrapers or building houses, all these corrupt behaviours, standover tactics and forcing builders and employers to pay more and get sweetheart deals have an economic impact. In fact, Commissioner Terence Cole made statements in the press about this just the other day. The economic consequences mean much more expensive buildings, and that means much more expensive leasing rates for the builder to get a return on his money and pay for the borrowings. It means small businesses are paying higher rents because construction costs are higher, and that means they have more money to pay in that part of their business than they have for employing people. Productivity gains lead to a better standard of living, higher wages and stronger employment growth. That is why it is so critical that the construction and building industry, which is a very large sector of the Australian economy, is run under the rule of law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous speakers have made a big deal about the coercive powers that the reconstituted ABCC will have. I have no problem with them, because the same coercive powers are already being used by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, APRA ASIC, the Australian Taxation Office, Centrelink and Medicare. Why should the construction industry be above the law or beyond the standard that everyone else has to comply with? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that has been brought up by speakers today is that it is a question of decreasing the safety of workers. With this legislation, there is a commitment to continue with the Federal Safety Commissioner. They are drawing a very long bow when they try to bring this in as an issue. We see in the press that they are trying to sully the argument by saying, 'We should have the equivalent of a federal ICAC.' The ABCC is a regulator, and it is strong regulation, and the rule of law in the construction workplace, in contracting and in deals has to be regulated. So no more secret commissions, bribes, standover tactics, blockades or sweetheart deals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent a good part of my university life working as a cleaner, getting up at 4 am and cleaning on weekends. If I were in a cleaning union now, and if I were to see what went on with Cleanevent, how union reps negotiated deals that made their members worse off, I would be ropable. Yet this seems to have been commonplace. Deals have been negotiated that have benefited the unions rather than the union members. I cannot believe it. Criminal proceedings have been there for all to see already, with HSU and other unions. So I think this legislation is really critical. We do have to get it up and running again to get a large part of our economy working efficiently under the rule of law. No-one should be afraid of that unless they are corrupt or they are operating outside the law. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and good luck in your preselection for the seat of Hughes. Anyway, we are here to talk about the ABCC. The Liberal Party has certainly shown their true colours in this bill, which also reflects the Labor Party's true colours. I am proud to say that not only am I a member of the SDA, but I am also a member of the electricians union in South Australia. I know they have a particular interest in this bill and a particular objection to it. Like so much of the Liberal Party's ideology, it remains dormant until it rears itself into full life. You can see it with the GST; they were talking about a 15 per cent GST when I joined the party in 1992; they are still talking about a GST. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like a dog with a bone, they keep coming back. So it is with criminalisation with industrial action. That is what they are doing here: they are seeking to take industrial action by workers and make it a criminal offence. This is not a new idea; it has been around for centuries. It is what used to happen whenever workers organised; whenever they asked for anything approaching justice, they were jailed. And it is still going on today. In China recently labour activists were rounded up in the dead of night, taken away and detained. This criminalisation of industrial action is nothing new, and unions know that the forces of capital and reaction will try it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a profound hostility to this bill and the ideology behind it. We heard the last speaker ponderously making his way through it all, but he did not talk about workers in the construction area. He did not talk about Ark Tribe—maybe I should give him the entry from Wikipedia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ark Tribe is a worker from South Australia. He was living out at Middle Beach in my electorate; he was a building worker. We normally would not know who Ark Tribe was. He would not show up on the ABC and he would not normally be mentioned in this House, but for the fact that he was prosecuted by the ABCC. What was his crime? What was the cause of the prosecution? It is all up there on the internet. In 2008 Ark Tribe attended the safety meeting at a construction site at Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia. Workers at the meeting discussed ongoing safety concerns at the site and carried out a union investigation into conditions before resuming work. That was the great crime against productivity and the great crime against his employer that he is alleged to have committed—he went to a safety meeting. Now we all know thanks to the member for Lalor—and common sense would tell you also—that construction sites are dangerous places. And not a little bit of danger, but danger that continues—they are very dangerous places. What did the ABCC do to Ark Tribe? They dragged him into a hearing; he could not have his lawyers there and of course he refused to answer questions; and so they prosecuted him. There is a picture of Ark here; I am happy to table it if those opposite want to look at a real worker with real concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that this organisation is going to go after bigwigs in the union movement—people who might be doing the wrong thing—is not right. The people the ABCC goes after are ordinary working Australians who work in a dangerous industry and want nothing more than to get up in the morning, go to work, to an honest day's work and go home at the end of it. That is their aim, and they want decent wages and decent conditions. They want a decent share of the wealth that is produced by this country and they know that the only people who will make sure that happens is the union. That is why they are members and that is why they are interested in being members. They take an interest in the unions; they have run their unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should remember the people that the ABCC actually investigated and prosecuted at huge cost to the Commonwealth. Think about Ark Tribe, who is a rigger and who is living out at Middle Beach. Suddenly he is in this world, where he is dragged into investigations and hearings and into the court. Who were the only ones to defend him? The union was the only one defending him. We should remember that when we approach this legislation and we should remember how unsafe these sites are. At the new Royal Adelaide Hospital site a construction worker did die; his name was Jorge Castillo-Riffo. And who took up the collection for his family? Well, his workmates did through their union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's remind ourselves how dangerous these sites are. Let's remind ourselves that workers lose their lives on these sites and that their families have to pick up the pieces and that their workmates care about that. What is more, they care about preventing the sorts of accidents that happen on their worksites. How must ordinary workers feel when they go to work in the morning, they work hard and they open up the paper and they see from time to time scandal after scandal regarding workplace conditions—regarding 7-Eleven, regarding Bayada, regarding sham contracting. They do not just see it here, they see it around the world. In particular they see the abuse and exploitation of migrant labour. They do not just see it around the world—all those egregious stories, the most recent having been of the Italian agricultural industry, with the mafia involvement and the exploitation of migrant labour—they see it now in their own country. Construction workers see it on their work sites, and they worry about it—not because they are against foreign workers but because they are against the exploitation of humanity and against the exploitation of workers who are put in a vulnerable position where they can be exploited. How must those workers feel when they see these scandals day after day in the paper? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the government's reaction to it? Instead of a legal and moral and compliance reaction from this government in regard to all of those scandals and all of those evils involving the exploitation of vulnerable people, rather than the full weight of the government being brought to bear on employers that exploit people, we have an $80 million royal commission into the unions. A very, very narrow set of guidelines was written for that royal commissioner to just go after the unions. So we see exploitation on one side and then we see a regulatory result that is totally skewed and totally biased. We know from other events—the attendance at fundraisers and the like, the long history of interactions—that those royal commissions cannot come up with unbiased findings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we find that there is a secret report that the government will not let half the parliament see. The minister makes his decision that half the parliament cannot see the secret, redacted report—an Inspector Clouseau style arrangement. The government's reaction is to go to cabinet—'We had better show them something'—and then we have this secret report that only one person from each major party, the Greens and Labor, can see, and they cannot tell anybody; they cannot take any notes; all they can do is view it. Why don't they just show them the front cover? It is a ridiculous end to a ridiculous and biased royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose $80 million for the Heydon royal commission looks like a bargain now compared to the $60 million spent in the previous royal commission by Mr Cole. Do you know how many prosecutions came out of the Cole royal commission? Zero—a big fat nothing. How do workers feel, when, on one hand, there are these great wrongs that are blindingly obvious, that nearly everybody who looks at them can see—they are in our papers, they are in our Senate committee hearings and they are right in your face if you go and work at any construction site in the country—yet, on the other hand, the regulatory response from the Turnbull government, from the Liberal Party, is to have a witch-hunt into the union movement. What is the result of those witch-hunts? Expensive and selective witch-hunts produce an expensive and selective application of the law. What is the whole design?—to go back to that philosophical grounding that the Liberal Party have, which is to make unions and unionists and industrial action illegal. The Liberal Party have really only ever had one idea, and that is to whip the donkey harder and to feed him less. That is their attitude to the workforce. That is the only idea they have ever had.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is completely insulting, and you cannot blame the crossbenchers for scoffing that the government might take this to the people, that the government might cause a double dissolution. Phil Coorey exposed very well how unlikely that is from a practical point of view—not least that the National Party have not settled their leadership yet. We know those opposite haven't quite sorted it all out.</span>

That is not the sort of nation we are, and we are not the sort of nation that applies selective laws to one section of the community and one section of the economy and one section of workers, as this bill will do. That is its greatest sin—that it puts all of the regulatory oversight on building workers and lets building employers, and all these other ills, all these other evils, go wanting.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  Problems with Australia's current industrial relations framework were highlighted by Labor's Fair Work Act Review Panel and various Productivity Commission inquiry and other reports and illuminated further through a never-ending caravan of Federal Court cases as well as the recent Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. There is not just a series of isolated spot fires in Australia's building and construction industry; there is a raging bushfire fuelled by the commercial and other interests of union bosses and the inherent conflicts of interest of those who represent them in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament's approach to making and policing industrial laws should not make lawful or acceptable in Australian workplaces what would otherwise be bullying, intimidating, threatening, illegal, violent, corrupt and criminal. The coalition government stands on the side of workers, employers and the independent judiciary. Australia is poorly served by those who would simply outsource Australia's industrial relations policy and practice to serial offenders who have an attitude of indifference to compliance with the requirements of our laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is now the second time in as many years that the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 has been before this House. It is a key government policy. It was an election commitment at both the 2010 and 2013 federal elections. Few could doubt that this government—indeed, this parliament—received a clear mandate from the Australian people to make the important changes contained within this bill. The coalition committed to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission in order to return the rule of law to commercial building sites and construction projects right across Australia as well as increase productivity. The body of evidence supporting the need for these changes is compelling. It is growing with every unlawful trespass, unlawful strike and unlawful union stop-work and with every judicial intervention and legal remedy. Make no mistake: it is costing money; it is reducing productivity; it is increasing costs; and it is costing jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a member of the coalition's working group tasked with examining the governance and other problems in the construction sector, which included recommendations to promptly re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The main object of the bill is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building and construction work to ensure that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and the Australian economy as a whole. Government must protect and maintain the rule of law and, wherever possible, drive productivity and economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Productivity Commission inquiry into workplace relations frameworks deliberately stayed away from the criminal aspects of Australia's industrial relations framework because they were the subject of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. The inquiry did, however, make a salient observation, which takes us back to the future, in citing the Cole royal commission, which acted as a catalyst for establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission over a decade ago. The Productivity Commission pointed out that industrial action over safety issues was increasingly a Trojan Horse for other objectives. It observed that some types of unlawful activities can give parties leverage in an industrial dispute by inflicting or threatening to inflict substantial harm, which may be economic or personal, on the other party unless the offending party's demands are met. The Productivity Commission pointed out that this was a significant problem in some sectors, especially the construction industry. It even provided broad examples of the unlawful conduct, which included delaying or blockading of workplaces and sites, bullying, verbal abuse and other coercive conduct and unlawful entry to sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an old saying that you cannot be a slave to two masters, and those opposite are most assuredly parroting lines scripted by their CFMEU bosses. The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption argued that the suggestion that the need for specific industrial regulation cannot be justified by criminal conduct occurring within the industry is misplaced, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It ignores the fact that a lot of the criminal conduct for which unions and union officials are responsible arises in the context of breaches of industrial laws (either because it occurs in the course of contravening industrial laws, or because it constitutes a criminal contempt of orders of a court restraining contraventions of industrial laws) and out of a culture of defiance of all laws. It also ignores the ability of a dedicated industrial regulator to assist police, through referrals and information sharing, in combatting criminal activity within the industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are seriously conflicted when it comes to industrial relations matters because the commercial and other interests of their biggest financial benefactors are not always in the national interest. With specific regard to the ongoing and flagrant abuses of Australia's industrial law framework and practice, the Federal Court points out that union officials' misbehaviour is 'coordinated and strategic'. It went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is fair to describe the CFMEU record as dismal. … The record indicates an attitude of indifference by the CFMEU to compliance with the requirements of the legislation regarding the exercise of rights of entry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear the Australian industrial framework needs a stronger cop on the beat, especially in the building and construction sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Building and Construction Industry (Improving productivity) Bill 2013 [No.2], re-establishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission to regulate the building and construction industry and provides for its functions and powers, including those of the ABCC inspectors. This is great news for the many members of my electorate who pleaded with me to do whatever I could to stop unions dictating the terms and conditions of operation for their businesses. One constituent informed me that the union prevented his business from receiving any jobs in Brisbane because he chose not to sign CFMEU's EBA. For this small business, union threats resulted in a net financial loss exceeding $500,000. Unnecessary interruptions, intimidation and disruption caused by unions on his building sites were the norm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence presented to the committee in the preparation of this bill two years ago was also consistent with the recurring themes presented in evidence and testimony to Fair Work Australia, the courts and the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. Aggressive and militant union behaviour is commonplace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I wish to briefly refer to a new report from Amnesty International highlighting the extent of the crackdown on freedom of expression currently taking place in Malaysia. The report—entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Critical r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">epression</span>—shows how the use of the Sedition Act in Malaysia has risen sharply since the Malaysian government won the 2013 general election. Between 2009 and 2012, there were around 30 charges under the Sedition Act. Since the 2013 election, however, there have been 176 sedition cases involving various individuals, usually for comments or acts deemed critical of the government. In 2015 alone, there were at least 91 instances of the Sedition Act being used to arrest, investigate or charge individuals, sometimes more than once. That is nearly five times as many as during the first 50 years of the act's existence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amnesty's report contends that freedom of expression is under attack in Malaysia, with civil society, activists, academics, opposition politicians, journalists and even cartoonists such as Zunar being targeted. Zunar's case is worth briefly highlighting. He is facing a record nine counts of sedition, one for each tweet he made following a Federal Court ruling on 10 February 2015 which upheld the conviction and prison sentence of former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. That case is widely seen by human rights groups as politically motivated and Amnesty International considers Anwar Ibrahim to be a prisoner of conscience. Amnesty International is calling on the Malaysian government to repeal the Sedition Act, ensure that all convictions under the act are quashed, and unconditionally release all those who are imprisoned or detained under the act. I urge the Australian government and parliamentary colleagues to acquaint themselves with this important Amnesty report.</span>

They have requested that I bring to parliament's attention a motion moved at a community meeting held last Saturday on the proposed establishment of a national radioactive waste management facility on a local property.    A property at Hill End was shortlisted, along with five others across Australia, for the construction of a national radioactive waste management facility. The Hill End community have voiced their opposition to the proposal. I have witnessed the community's sentiment on the matter first hand at a number of community meetings. On both occasions it was clear they remain united against the establishment of such a facility.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hill End have requested they be immediately ruled out and not have to wait until March or whenever for the government's response on which communities might continue dialogue over the placement of the facility. Minister Frydenberg has stated that the communities that government will continue discussions with will be announced sometime after 11 March. I ask for the voices of Hill End to be listened to.</span>

We all know that in a former life our Prime Minister was the Minister for Communications, taking over the NBN when the coalition came to government. People, particularly on that side of the House, were excited because this supposedly experienced businessman was now in charge and everything was going to be right with the NBN. He certainly managed to double the cost. I wonder whether that means he has increased business profit, and whether that is what his business acumen was about. In my electorate of Lalor, swathes—most—of the electorate will not have the NBN by his promised date of the end of 2016. What is coming through loud and clear during the last week is that those people fortunate enough to get the original Labor Party NBN—fibre to the premises—are now dealing with an NBN that they cannot contact. I have an email here from a constituent who has had three appointments to get the NBN hooked up inside her brand-new home. These appointments were a week apart, but each time was a no-show. She is left having to contact Telstra, her provider—she cannot get direct access to the NBN, there is no-one to talk to at the NBN, she still does not have a home phone and she is running around with a mobile. She has to get in the car and drive around the corner to get reception to ring Telstra to say, 'Please can I have a phone', only to hear, 'We are not the NBN; sorry, love.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute and bid farewell to a remarkable lady, Linda Morton, who lost her brave battle with cancer on 7 December. Linda was a respected member of the Wyong district community, and if you ever needed to know what was happening in the valleys you only needed to ask Linda. Linda loved horse racing and was a regular visitor to the Wyong races, on numerous occasions winning the best dressed award. Linda was fiercely proud of her family and the life Australia had provided to her. Linda emigrated from Manchester, England, to begin a new life, eventually settling in the Wyong area where she met her husband Trevor. I came to know Linda through our association with the Liberal Party. Those within the party will remember Linda for her humour, tenacity and bluntness when it came to dealing with particular matters and particular people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Linda was immensely proud of her family and of her community and we, the Liberal and Wyong communities, were very proud of Linda. As hundreds gathered at her funeral to pay our respects we were reminded by Linda of her sense of humour as she left the church to Vera Lynne singing <span style="font-style:italic;">Wish me luck </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s you wave</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">me goodbye</span>. She asked us not to cry but to smile, and not to mourn her passing but to remember and celebrate the life she had lived. I offer my sincere condolences to the Morton family, to Trevor and Ben and their family, who can be proud of her legacy and dedication to her family and the Wyong community.</span>

They presented Councillor Mark Weragoda and me with the Victorian Scouts scarf. Their aim is to help promote the positive impact and involvement being involved in the Scouts can bring to our young people. 1st Strathfieldsaye Scout Group did an amazing job on Australia Day, with over 600 locals engaging in their Australia Day celebrations. They partnered with the local Lions club to ensure that everybody had a wonderful breakfast. This is an ambitious group and the club is growing at Cub, Scout and Venturer levels. In fact, they have been so successful that they have had a few of their own Venturer Scouts go on to become Queen's Scouts in previous years. </span>

I would like to congratulate the 1st Strathfieldsaye Scout Group on their ongoing work in our community and the way they are partnering with clubs and other groups within our community to make sure that local needs are met. They work with our schools; they work with our local council; they work with other groups in the area to make sure that events like Australia Day happen and are successful.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I am delighted to inform the House that a former student of the Launceston Church Grammar School, in my electorate of Bass, is one of three outstanding young Tasmanians awarded 2016 Rhodes scholarships. James Haw is currently a cavalry officer serving in the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment. He grew up in Launceston and, after completing his schooling, was accepted for officer training in the Australian Army. James graduated second in his class at Duntroon after graduating from the University of New South Wales with a Bachelor of Arts first-class honours degree and the University Medal in Politics. James joins an elite list of people who have been awarded Rhodes scholarships and is one of the very few from the Australian Defence Force.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of spending time with James recently in Launceston, discovering that he is an avid South-East Asianist. He has attended the Indonesian army military academy and Universitas Airlangga—the second-oldest university in Indonesia. At Oxford, James will study a Master of Philosophy in Social Anthropology, aimed at better understanding the impact of military operations in the world's tribal regions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, James is the 17th student from the Launceston Church Grammar School to become a Rhodes scholar. I congratulate him and the school on this wonderful achievement. I know his family in Launceston and many school friends will draw great pride from his outstanding academic career. I am sure the Australian Defence Force will benefit from his studies as a Rhodes scholar.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Yesterday, thousands of people attended a funeral service held to farewell Kris Guglielmucci. Kris was a youth pastor associated with the Victory Church at Pooraka and the Edge Church at Reynella. He was at a youth camp in the Adelaide Hills with about 100 young people and about 20 other church leaders when a freak storm event arose and he was struck by lightning. As the storm became more intense, Kris's concern was for the safety of the young people rather than for his own safety, attempting to ensure that they were all out of harm's way. The service drew people from around the world—testament to the regard with which Kris was held by those who knew him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Sunday, hundreds of people packed the Victory Church to hear a service, led by pastors Tony and Kath Rainbow, that was dedicated to Kris. It was one of several services devoted to him held since the tragedy. As a youth pastor and a member of the worldwide youth movement Planetshakers, Kris touched the lives of so many people. He will be widely missed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kris leaves behind his wife, Lisa, and their four young children. For them, the loss is the greatest. I know that they have been helped immensely by their church colleagues. My condolences go to Lisa and the children, to his parents, Danny and Sharonne, to his family, to all of his colleagues and friends at Victory and Edge churches, and to all those who knew him. May he rest in peace.</span>

ConocoPhillips, QGC and GLNG have partnered with Energy Apprenticeship Group, EAG, and the Central Queensland University to develop a tailor-made LNG operator training program for Gladstone. The program will see locals from Flynn with no prior LNG experience gain the qualifications to apply for LNG-processing operator roles in the three plants on Curtis Island.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be an annual intake of trainees into the program, which kicks off this week with the first intake of 18 trainees—six for each plant. The traineeship includes both classroom and on-the-job training. The trainees will initially be employed by EAG during their training period. Trainees will graduate in about 12 months with certificate III national qualifications. ConocoPhillips contributed to the purpose-built, small-scale version of an LNG plant—worth more than $1 million—for trainees to get practical experience.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is fantastic news for Gladstone and Central Queensland because it is all about new jobs for the local people. In future, this program will develop as the plants develop. I have been a strong supporter of jobs for Central Queensland, and this only helps our cause.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an excellent project. The Alpine Valleys is one of the most profitable dairy areas in Australia. I was absolutely delighted to showcase to my colleagues in the House committee the work that they are doing—their work with the community, particularly with the local high school at Tallangatta, their work with local government and other agencies around land management, and their work on transition in and out of farming. I would like to put on record the work of Stuart and Sarah Crosthwaite, Patten Bridge, Patrick Glass, Karen Moroney, Scott and Belinda McKillop, Ken and Lyn Jones, Alex Paton, Mick O'Keefe, Lauren Elvin, Jo Turner, Kelly Behrens, Lachlan Campbell, and Brendan and Sarah Glass. I thank them for their work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Agriculture is core business in my electorate of Indi. It is core business in Victoria. For all those who eat food, it is our core business. We saw last week that some of the innovation taking place there—in governance, in increasing productivity and in land management—is, in fact, leading right across Australia. I would like to say, 'Well done,' to the Alpine Valleys people for their work. Keep it up. I am very proud to be your representative in parliament. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I rise to speak about this year's ABC Heywire competition. Heywire, now in its 18th year, is a competition run by the ABC which delivers a platform to young Australians from rural, regional and remote Australia to share their stories and ideas. Winners have their stories broadcast nationally via ABC radio and, of course, are invited to participate in the annual Heywire Regional Youth Summit here in Canberra.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">2015 has delivered another excellent swathe of content. I have enjoyed listening to these stories over the Christmas-New Year period. This morning I met with Shkiba Nasery and Rebecca Greening, two of this year's winners, who hail from Renmark and Naracoorte, respectively, in my electorate of Barker. Shkiba's story, 'Dad left us for six years to find a better future', and Rebecca's, 'We need to open our hearts to different cultures', are thought-provoking and insightful productions. I commend both of them on their efforts and their recognition in this year's competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shkiba and Rebecca's Heywire contributions highlight the cultural diversity within my electorate of Barker. Shkiba, born in in a small village in Afghanistan, recounts her family's courageous journey to Australia via the humanitarian resettlement program, while Rebecca, who hails from Naracoorte, a regional town that has resettled hundreds of families via that same program, chose to focus on the importance of integrating new migrants into our community and introducing them to our culture and values. I wish Shkiba, Rebecca and their fellow Heywire winners every success at this year's summit as they build on their leadership skills and develop their innovative ideas to deliver a better future for rural, regional and remote Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Recently the community of Kingsford Smith lost a true hero and local legend in Dan Cullen. Born in Bunbury, Western Australia, in 1914, Dan showed early talent as a golfer and would go on to win the Western Australian Open in 1937 and 1938. In 1941, Dan put his golfing career on hold to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force and served three years as a Lancaster bomber pilot in Europe. In April 1944, a shell struck his plane over Friedrichshafen, injuring members of his crew and crippling his aircraft. But thanks to his bravery and skill Dan ensured a safe return, which earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross medal. All up, Dan flew 32 operational flights over Europe. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon returning home, Dan was appointed club professional at Roseville Golf Club before moving to St Michael's Golf Club at Little Bay in our community. In 1977, at the age of 64, he became the oldest qualifier at the British Open and went on to teach the game of golf to thousands at Cullen's Driving Range, next to St Michael's Golf Club, which he operated from the late 1960s. The Cullen name is synonymous with golf in our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July last year, at 100 years of age, Dan received the Legion d'Honneur medal, the highest decoration in France, for his wartime service. Dan Cullen passed away on Australia Day aged 101. On behalf of our community, I thank Dan for his service to our community and our nation and I offer my condolences to his family and friends.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Last week I hosted a community jobs forum at the Hervey Bay Boat Club both to inform job seekers about help available to them and to encourage local businesses to employ. Unemployment is the single biggest issue in my electorate of Hinkler. Reducing unemployment is my No. 1 priority, and I wanted to ensure Hinkler residents were well informed about the options available to them. My office sent out some 10,000 invitations by email, letterbox drop, job agencies and training providers. As a result, about 100 people attended the forum. Several attendees contacted my office afterwards to say just how worthwhile and valuable it was to them. As well as attendees receiving information about the various federal government incentives and programs, guest speakers provided tips on how to start a small business, how to prepare for job interviews and how to make your resume stand out. I would like to thank Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, Luke Hartsuyker, who attended the forum at my invitation and spoke about jobs and industries of the future and what skills would be in high demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that one of the major hurdles that job seekers face locally is a lack of vacancies and, of course, the high number of applicants. That is why we are working to give businesses the confidence to expand. The complex economic and social reasons for our region's historically high unemployment rate cannot be addressed overnight, but we are making some real progress. The latest ABS data for the Wide Bay region shows unemployment has dropped to 8½ per cent. That is still unacceptably high, but with major projects like the gas pipeline and the Knauf manufacturing plant on the way I look forward to further improvement.</span>

These are, of course, the hardworking men who lost their jobs and were taken in the middle of the night to be replaced by a foreign crew working on flag-of-convenience ships. I bring this to be House's attention because in my electorate of Newcastle the maritime workers face a very similar problem with the <span style="font-style:italic;">CSL Melbourne</span> being taken out of Australian coastal shipping too. So, to the crew of the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span>, you can be assured that the people of Newcastle have your plight and your struggle very much in their minds, and I thank you for your presence today.</span>

Despite overwhelming evidence that there are significant service problems with the department, the Minister for Human Services fails to act and, indeed, denies there is a problem at all. I would like to present just one example. Earlier this week there was a constituent who called my office for assistance. He is attempting to apply for a carer payment to help look after a very unwell loved one. He needs the relevant forms to apply. He went online. The system was down. He was told to phone in. He had to wait 45 minutes. That dropped out. He had to wait another hour. </span>

It has received more than 5,000 signatures since Monday. These laws risk 6,000 jobs and $150 million to the Queensland economy. In Brisbane alone 1,700 jobs will be lost. That affects all our local security guards, cleaners, glassies, bartenders, musicians, DJs—and the list goes on. It is not just business owners; the flow-on effect will be huge. The entertainment industry of Brisbane is worth $435 million a year. It employs 16,000 people, and there are more than 7,200 licensed venues in Brisbane. All of this is at risk thanks to state Labor's short-sighted laws. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from a growing body of evidence that lockout laws have questionable results in reducing violence. We all oppose violence of any sort. Everyone deserves the right to have a safe night out. Everyone deserves to feel that they can go out freely. Violence of any kind is shocking, and it breaks all our hearts when we see this happen. But what we need is a proper solution to alcohol and drug fuelled violence. We need public education, community campaigns and awareness in high schools.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Local government is one of the most important levels of government. It is absolutely critical to the planning and the administration of municipal services. That is why many have argued—since Gough Whitlam, indeed—that it should be recognised in our Constitution. On this side of the House we backed such a proposition in the last parliament, only to have it sabotaged by those on the other side. If it were in the Constitution, the New South Wales government could not be doing what it is about to do in New South Wales, which is the egregious and antidemocratic act of forcing mergers on councils where neither the councils nor those they represent are interested in it. In my electorate of Throsby the merger of two councils—the Shellharbour council and its northern cousin the Wollongong council—has been proposed. It is said that this is about creating scale and efficiency. This cannot be true because there are three local councils in my electorate and it is not proposed to merge the smallest of them. In fact, all up and down the coast of New South Wales a lot of councils that are a lot smaller than Shellharbour and Wollongong are being left alone. It is an antidemocratic act. This is why I attended a rally on Saturday where I said I cannot see how one job is going to be created by this proposal but I can see how lots of jobs will be lost. I am calling upon all Liberal MPs, in all houses of parliament, to use their vote to oppose these proposals. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Over the next six months, more work will be done on the construction of retaining walls, electrification, noise treatments and landscaping. And landscaping is what I want to finish on. I have been working closely with well-known constituents Graham Ross and Kent Ross and my state colleague Damien Tudehope to ensure that the area—Beecroft and Cheltenham—receives much-needed revegetation after the construction. This is to maintain the particularly unique character of my electorate, and I emphasise the importance of that in relation to this development.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  At midday today I went down to see the workers who have been sacked from the MV <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland</span>—workers who have manned that ship that moves alumina between Bunbury and Portland, and have been doing so for the last 28 years. These are solid Australian workers, skilled Australian workers, who are doing an Australian job. We were there to stand with them in solidarity and to show our deep concern about the wilful way in which this government is dismantling the blue collar workforce within Australia, and the cavalier decisions they are making time and time again to do away with those jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was quite ironic that, immediately prior to going down to join with that sacked workforce, we had a series of briefings on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. One of the messages that came through loud and clear is the complete asymmetry in the labour market mobility provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This means Australia is prepared to give away far more in terms of, in particular, blue collar technical jobs, trade jobs. We are giving those jobs away without getting in return the right to go into those markets that are part of this agreement. The United States has refused to participate— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I am pleased to say that most of those threats have now been downgraded and lives and property are no longer in immediate danger. However, the situation does remain severe with approximately 68 fires still active, 43 of which are currently uncontrolled. To date, more than 107,000 hectares have been burnt—including 18,374 hectares, or 1.16 per cent, of the Tasmanian World Heritage area.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The response to these fires has been enormous. The contribution from other states and territories has been generous and is gratefully appreciated. Firefighting resources from Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, the ACT and New Zealand have been deployed. There are currently approximately 170 firefighters from interstate working with personnel from Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, Forestry Tasmania and Tasmania Fire Service, and there are 41 aircraft operating throughout the state to assist in combating the fires to bring them under control over the coming weeks. I want to thank all the dedicated personnel from the SES, fire services and volunteers for a mammoth effort. I also want to thank all the residents and owners of the properties, who followed to the letter the emergency advice and directions of emergency personnel to preserve life during these emergency situations.</span>

I am pleased we get to recognise this each year when we gather to applaud and celebrate people's efforts and to present them with a Local Legends award. I want to congratulate the 36 recipients who joined us at Logan Diggers Services Club last month, as well as their loved ones who were there and the people who nominated them. They were drawn from all corners of the community—schools, charities, sports, the RSL, multicultural communities, emergency services and other groups. They were from different walks of life, but they all had in common the characteristic of selflessness.</span>

The Local Legends awards are all about telling those stories and celebrating those stories through a great afternoon like we had at Logan Diggers. Our whole community is strengthened by the people whose efforts we applauded at the ceremony and the time and commitment they devote to looking out for other people. I want to thank them for their work and for their selflessness. I also want to thank everyone who came along to the ceremony on the day and also my state colleagues who did such a terrific job as MCs.</span>

The Geraldton City Speedway was established in 1964 by a group of Geraldton revheads, originally racing on a block of land they leased north of the Geraldton airport. The speedway stayed there for two years until the property owner leased it out for cropping. All the members, then, got together and purchased the eight-hectare block at Moonyoonooka, where the speedway remains. Led by President Mike Doble, the speedway has grown significantly over the last few years, attracting more spectators, members and sponsors—so much so that this year I am a proud sponsor of the junior sedan class, this season.</span>

Twice in our history, coalition governments have acted decisively to ensure that the pernicious, criminal trade of people smuggling cannot succeed. Our commitment today is simply this: the people smugglers will not prevail over our sovereignty. Our borders are secure. The line has to be drawn somewhere, and it is drawn at our border.</span>

By a six to one majority, the High Court rejected a challenge to Australia's offshore detention arrangements, and it upheld the existing framework as legally and constitutionally valid. Now, we will consider the judgement and its implications carefully. But what I can say is this: our system of deterrence remains robust and has recently been reinforced to deal with immediate and enduring threats to our maritime security and sovereignty.</span>

Well, we had an experiment, didn't we? Mr Rudd prevailed: 50,000 arrivals, hundreds drowned at sea. There is no doubt: if we wish to keep our borders secure, if we wish to stop people drowning at sea, if we want to keep our borders safe, if we want to maintain support for our whole immigration policy, if we want the capacity to bring in refugees from Syria—12,000 additional refugees from persecuted minorities—then we need a strong border protection regime, and this government will stand steadfast in protecting the border.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, we are focusing on those things that matter. We are focusing on the fact that it is important that local principals are able to make local decisions to benefit of local schools. Under our StudentsFirst policy, we are focusing on those elements that are going to improve educational outcome. Our funding is based on strong evidence, and we are committed to negotiating with the states and territories from 2018 onwards with regard to education outcomes, and we will also be negotiating with the non-government sector. Labor's plan is unfocused, it is unfunded and it simply has not been thought through—just more spending without understanding what works.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor really needs to go back to school regarding its three-page thought bubble. The document should really have been called 'Your child. Their debt'. Labor simply does not understand that future generations will be burdened by its irresponsible spending, with no regard for delivering outcomes.</span>

Can I say, Mr Speaker, and I say to the honourable member in particular, who has in her electorate Deakin University—which is a university that is committed to driving innovation—innovation in advanced manufacturing—and who has a community that understands that the transition from conventional manufacturing to more advanced and more sophisticated technology is absolutely critical to Australia's continued success: the unquestionable fact of life for us is that if we are to maintain our success as a high wage, generous social welfare net, first world economy, if we want our children and grandchildren to have high quality jobs, well paying jobs, then we have to be at the frontier of innovation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do in many respects is to change the culture of business and of government. We need to move to a culture that does not assume the way you did things yesterday is any longer appropriate, that you have got to be prepared to look at new approaches all the time. Because the simple fact is that the pace of change has never been so rapid. That is the biggest characteristic of the global economy at the moment: the extraordinary rapid pace of change. It is driven by technology; it is driven by globalisation. It means that every business, every government, every firm—large or small—has to be proactive, has to be innovative and has to be constantly looking at new things. </span>

                  </a>  The honourable member says it is about education. It absolutely is. And that is why we are devoting millions of dollars to promote coding in schools so that our children have digital literacy, because that is going to be just as important as reading, writing and arithmetic was to most of us when we were at school. These changes also affect the rate of investment. Because of the leadership the government is showing, we are starting to see some of these big superannuation funds for the first time investing more into the start-up sector. That is where leadership matters. It is where the change of culture, the business culture, matters and where we will see the prosperity for our children and grandchildren in the future. </span>

Why did the Liberal Party promise to match school funding dollar for dollar before the election but after the election announce a cut which is the equivalent of $3.2 million for every school in Australia or the equivalent of sacking one in seven teachers? Isn't this just another example of the Prime Minister saying one thing and then doing another? </span>

Unlike the Labor opposition, the government will not promise money first and then seek to negotiate outcomes later. The Labor Party has no credibility when it comes to big spending proposals, as they have no way of funding them.

That is their own Labor premier understanding keenly the realities of the school system over which he presides. We should not be surprised by this. The Labor Party has form, and it is consistent. They made funding commitments in the out years when they were last in government, beyond the forward estimates. They are making huge promises again, which are unfunded and undeliverable. </span>

These are the major contributors to improved student outcomes. </span>

They pay no attention to the fact that, despite more and more money being spent on schools, the student outcomes have deteriorated. Our commitment to parents is simply this: we want to ensure that your children emerge from the school system with better skills in literacy, with better skills in numeracy and being able to understand the digital economy of the 21st century. That is our commitment. That is why we work to improve teacher quality. We are acting on the recommendations of the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group: mandatory national literacy, mandatory national numeracy tests for teachers from July this year. That is our commitment—quality outcomes—not just spending money they do not know where they can find.</span>

Let me say that this is a very important issue. In fact, it is an issue that has been raised with me by my National Party colleagues and my Liberal Party colleagues who represent those who live in regional and rural Australia. The purpose of the government's childcare package is to provide simpler, more affordable, more flexible and more accessible child care no matter where you live. Flexibility is vital for families in rural and remote locations and we understand the important role that mobile childcare services play. Mobile services offer innovative flexible child care that is particularly suitable for those in rural locations and also Indigenous communities who may not be able to sustain a full-scale childcare service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, families who use this type of service are not able to access any subsidies. But the government is assisting those families. As part of our reforms mobile childcare services will be eligible for the childcare subsidy, which is great news for rural and remote families. For the first time, families using the service will be eligible to claim the same assistance as families using other types of child care. The subsidy will be paid directly to childcare providers and the income will be assured, which is great news. It will also be able to be expanded as the size of the particular service increases. These providers have not previously had this opportunity. Their funding has remained static no matter how many children attended the service. And because these services often support families in disadvantaged communities, many mobile services will also be eligible for additional funding through the government's $858 million Child Care Safety Net.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the importance of providing child care to Australian families, and that is why we are investing over $40 billion in funding over the next four years. That is some $3 billion in additional funding, which is great news for Australian families. We are delivering affordable, flexible child care to over one million Australian families under this package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has no credibility on child care. Under Labor, mobile services could not access the childcare benefit and they could not access the childcare rebate, so families using this service were excluded from assistance. We are fixing that under this package. Under Labor, funding for these services was fixed and could not grow to meet demand. Well, we are also fixing the problem. We are about simpler, more affordable, more flexible and more accessible child care, and the members opposite should be applauding this very fine policy.</span>

I am sure he would agree that the way I would like to respond to his question draws on a fairly unfamiliar source to this side of the House—Paul Keating. I agree with Paul Keating, who said today that higher taxes for higher spending is not a plan for jobs for growth. What he said today is that the big falls in commodity prices means Australia's income has been cut. We cannot pretend we can go on spending as though nothing has happened. Those opposite may think that, but this is what Paul Keating said:</span>

                  </a>  That is the aim of our policy—not to restrain it with a burgeoning public sector. That is what this government is doing. That is our plan. We are interested in things that will ultimately see taxes fall in this country, not see taxes ever higher to chase ever higher levels of spending which it can never catch—and, as a result, you borrow more and more and more. That is why the government has credible measures in place to reduce government spending as a share of the economy in this country from 25.9 per cent this year to 25.3 per cent at the end of the forward estimates. This was reinforced in our midyear statement, and that midyear statement was well received by the rating agencies. Moody's said: 'Notwithstanding the fiscal challenges ahead, we expect the government's fiscal position to remain within a range consistent with its AAA rating. The MYEFO incorporates a realistic view of the fiscal implications of lower growth. The government's commitment to fiscal consolidation is evident in the projected narrowing in the fiscal deficits. The policy's focus on improving the government's fiscal position supports the sovereign's credit profile.' That is our plan. That is what we are doing. We are reducing the share of government as a share of the economy so we can let the private sector expand and continue the strong jobs growth that we have seen. We saw 300,000-plus jobs last year. What we have is job-intensive economic growth in this country. There are more jobs in every single inch of that growth we are achieving in these difficult circumstances.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have a very different point of view. What they are saying is that, of all the big 'savings' measures—they call tax increases 'savings'—they have come up with $7.6 billion in higher taxes. But that does not even get them to the point of the almost $14 billion in new spending they have announced just since the budget. On top of that, there is some $30 billion in savings that we have put in place. They want to put spending back on the agenda and almost $13 billion in measures they continue to block.</span>

Those opposite have no thought of empathy or compassion for those who are working more every day and have to pay higher taxes; no empathy whatsoever for small businesses who are working harder every day and are getting no relief in the tax system for their extra effort. On this side of the House we know that that is a priority, but you have to be able to pay for it.

                  </a>  Quite apart from cleaning up criminality, fixing building and construction in Australia, fixing that industry, is good for our economy and it is good for productivity, which makes it good for jobs and growth. The last time the Australian Building and Construction Commission was in existence, under the former minister for industrial relations, the member for Warringah, productivity in building and construction improved by over nine per cent. Consumers were $7½ billion a year better off annually and there were fewer days lost through industrial action because of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The Leader of the Opposition decided, when he was the minister, to scrap the ABCC and turn his back on all of those opportunities for jobs and growth that had been created by the member for Warringah.</span>

This side of the House wants to do it. The Labor Party is leading the opposition to it. Why on earth could they be against it?

In case he missed it, I will run through it. In 2015-16, the schools funding is $15.7 billion. The next year it goes up by 8.1 per cent to $17 billion. The next year it goes up by six per cent to $18 billion. The year after that it goes up by four per cent to $18.7 billion. So every single year, this government is increasing funding to public schools and schools in this country. That is what we are doing, and we are doing that at the same time as I read out the increases in the expenditure that we are putting into schools. Expenditure, as a share of GDP in this country, is falling from 25.9 per cent to 25.3 per cent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make that point for this very critical reason: we are funding these increases by savings in the budget—by actually reducing expenditure and having priorities that ensure that we can fund these very things. That is not the approach of those opposite. If those opposite had come and said, 'Here are the savings that we're going to make to fund increases in other areas,' that would be a different issue.</span>

I am surprised that the member opposite is not aware of that. The point I am making is: we are supporting the increases in funding for public schools and education in this country by getting control of government expenditure in other areas so we can afford it. Those opposite do not have such a plan.</span>

Of course, all Australians benefit from a stronger economy and the growth and job creation that this government has put at the top of the agenda. But there are some communities that have not shared as strongly in our nation's growth and prosperity, and we are determined to make sure that government supports them to get through their difficult times but also to ensure that they can share in the good things that Australia can offer.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a number of specific programs identified to help those communities that have particular difficulties—the $45 million Stronger Communities Program, the $35 million program to help remote drought-stricken communities, $350 million for the Community Development Program, and, of course, the billion-dollar National Stronger Regions program. It was a pleasure to be in the honourable member's electorate during the Christmas break, when we visited a number of towns in his community to announce $6.25 million under the Stronger Regions program for a swimming pool at Blackwater, a town that is significantly affected by the downturn in the mining industry. We also visited a very small community called Sapphire in the gem fields of Central Queensland to announce $110,000 to help develop the Sapphire Wetlands Reserve to encourage tourists and help people to build the economy of that region. In all, $294 million was announced under the Stronger Regions program for 111 projects in communities right across the country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also during the break, we announced $100 million to fund another 189 projects in our Bridges Renewal Program. There were also some of those in the member for Flynn's electorate. Many of these bridges have prevented people from getting from their properties into town, to school or to other important communication networks within their region. This repair and rebuild program is reconnecting communities and making such a difference. Local government in many parts of the country have hundreds of bridges like these that they are expected to maintain and rebuild. They have not been able to manage it. We promised this program in two elections. Now that we have been elected we are getting on with delivering it. These 189 bridges add to the announcements we have made previously to help repair these vital road networks.</span>

I have made it very clear what the expenditure figures are for education in the budget going forward. That is perfectly clear. For those watching, the good news is that the government's funding for education is going up every year—every single year it is going up.

I am pleased to take this opportunity to update the House about the Zika virus. It is so named because it was first discovered in the Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947, so it has indeed been around for a long time. Both the Chief Medical Officer and I have briefed the opposition, the crossbench and the Greens. This is, of course, a bipartisan issue as we confront what the World Health Organization has not described as a global emergency but certainly has elevated to national and international concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 23 cases of the Zika virus that have been notified in Australia have all been contracted overseas. However, there is a risk because the main vector, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Aedes aegypti</span> mosquito, is found in Central and North Queensland—hence, of course, the member for Leichhardt's strong interest in this issue. The best way to prevent oneself from contracting Zika is not to be bitten by the mosquito, and there is no evidence that transmission takes place person-to-person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has, of course, become of great interest recently because of the association between cases of Zika virus and microcephaly—which is babies being born with a small head—in Brazil, and other countries in Central and South America and the closer Pacific islands have all come under scrutiny when cases have arisen most recently. So the best advice for Australians is to follow the travel advice and to take particular care when travelling to those countries and to note particularly that, if you are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant, there is a risk of travelling to those areas of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Zika is a nationally notifiable disease. We are working in close partnership with state health organisations and we are taking the necessary steps at our border: disinfecting aircraft and controlling areas where exotic insects, including mosquitoes, might breed. So Australians can feel confident that the Department of Health, state partners and the department of agriculture—and the stewardship of the minister of biosecurity and quarantine—are watching this carefully and will continue to keep the House informed and updated.</span>

Nothing seems to have changed. One of the enduring things in the opposition's question pack is that question about the GST.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the honourable member knows, there is—and one of his colleagues, the shadow Treasurer, has quoted from the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, in an article about the GST—a live debate about tax reform in Australia. It has been informed by material published by this government. It has been informed by contributions from many people. And it has been informed by contributions by state premiers, two of whom, at least, have advocated an increase in the GST. I can say to the honourable member that the government is considering carefully all of these proposals. The government has not made a decision to change any element of the tax system, beyond those that have already been announced of course, such as the multinational tax avoidance changes—which honourable members will recall the Labor Party voted against. They were so troubled by large multinationals avoiding tax, they actually stood in the way of reforms which brought our multinational tax avoidance laws into the 21st century! That is how serious the Labor Party was in terms of protecting Australian businesses that are paying a full rate of tax and how little interest they had in helping the government and the Taxation Office in collecting tax from large multinationals that have, of course, by reason of their global structures, abilities to avoid tax and structure their way around tax that small businesses in Australia, for example, do not.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is considering all options for reform and for change very, very carefully, and when the government has made a decision I can assure the honourable member that he will be one of the first to know.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health, Minister for Sport and Minister for Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:49</span>):  It is a pleasure to take a question from the member for Bennelong, and indeed I did visit the Bennelong electorate to attend an initiative, a very good initiative initiated by my friend, the Bennelong health forum, which brings together innovation, pharmaceuticals, device manufacturers, people involved in public health, universities and many more, coming together in a large number to talk about our future, innovation when it comes to health, and the opportunity, of course, for patients, consumers, and those inside the health system to benefit from what these remarkable companies do and the contribution they make. In fact, the member for Bennelong is, I understand, bringing the forum to Canberra later this year, and I know that he will easily fill the Great Hall and spread a very strong message. He is indeed a great supporter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my pleasure to advise the House that there is a breakthrough. There are indeed many breakthroughs, but one that we announced during the day that I spent with the member for Bennelong was a breakthrough recently funded on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Effective from this Monday, 1 February, the government has funded the drug ruxolitinib, for the treatment of the rare condition of myelofibrosis, which is a cancer of the bone marrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an investment of over $180 million over the next four years for a debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition that affects approximately four in 100,000 Australians. It is a small number of people. It is a rare cancer. We should be very encouraged that the world-class health system that we are able to bring to every single Australian allows us to fund this drug, which would otherwise cost those patients $100,000 a treatment—something they clearly would never be able to afford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much is said about MYEFO and the saves that the government makes, but not enough is said about the spends. In the December MYEFO, there was a $1.6 billion listing—a government spend on new breakthrough medicines, which included over $1 billion to fund revolutionary new treatments to cure hepatitis C, and also the drug ruxolitinib that I mentioned. We have already listed twice as many drugs on the PBS—new medicines, breakthrough medicines—than the previous government. We take this very seriously. It is the reason that we have to build the most sustainable health system we can, in order that we continue to make such treatments available to Australians.</span>

She makes reference to some very serious issues that I know Australians are concerned about as they see the volatility that is occurring in the global economy and the volatility that we have seen in markets, particularly over the past month. I think that is a real cause for concern, particularly for independent retirees, who are most in the front line of a lot of the impacts we have seen happening in those markets. These times more than ever highlight the need to ensure that we do everything we can to strengthen our financial position, to ensure that there is stability in the government's finances, and not do things that place pressure on the government's budget position, as those opposite plan to do.</span>

                  </a>  I am not. Those opposite seem to think that the consumption tax in this country is on everything. It is actually not on everything. What the government is doing is ensuring that we have a tax system that will be growth friendly. As the Prime Minister said, we are engaged in an open conversation with the Australian people and we will work through all the various options that are available.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a litmus test on this, and at the end of the day the government has to be confident that any changes would be supportive of growth and jobs and would be conditioned to the economic environment, particularly globally, that we find at this time. So we are moving forward with strong plans to reduce the size of government expenditure as a proportion of the economy, as I have indicated, which has been well-received by the ratings agencies and recognised as being a credible path to ensuring that we are getting the budget under control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have one plan: that is, to raise taxes to pay for higher and higher spending. The one way you can keep taxes down in this country is to ensure that expenditure is as low as you can conceivably have it to provide the services that people in this country need and depend on. That is our plan. Our plan is to keep expenditure under control. The plan those opposite is to tax as high as they can to chase the spending that will forever go up, as occurred when they were last in government. They have learnt nothing.</span>

It is with the resources in Durack that Australia has become the world's largest exporter in the world of iron ore, and by 2019-20 will be the world's largest export of LNG. Durack and the people of Durack are great beneficiaries of the boom in mining, which saw $400 billion worth of investment between 2003 and 2014, record terms of trade, record job creation and record income growth.</span>

                  </a>  It is true that commodity prices have come down, but that the outlook is still a positive one. That is because demand is growing. In December last year China had one of the highest rates on record of importation of iron ore, and China is growing still at around seven per cent, off a larger base. India had economic growth of 7.4 per cent and will be tripling its steel production between now and 2025.</span>

Three-quarters of the iron ore production in Australia is in the bottom half of the global cost curve, and companies like BHP, Rio and Fortescue, with assets in the Pilbara, in the electorate Durack, are remotely operating trucks and trains and drilling equipment from their operations centre 1,500 kilometres away in Perth.</span>

So, when the Prime Minister talks about a culture of innovation, he is not just talking about a local start-up. He is also talking about established sectors like the resources sector, and the Australian resources sector in particular, which is highly efficient, has economies of scale, and, with the lower Australian dollar, is continuing to do well.</span>

Yesterday in question time the member for McMahon—hard to recognise with his handsome beard—was crowing about Labor's record on budget savings. He cited the $70 billion figure. This figure is stated to be over 10 years. Over the next four years, the forward estimates, the savings that have been announced by Labor are claimed by Labor to amount to $8 billion. That is around $2 billion a year, so on average their claimed savings would cover around 0.4 per cent of spending every year. The Labor Party would still need to find another $50 billion over the next four years to make up for the shortfall of the savings they are blocking, all of their spending promises and all of the savings they have promised to reverse. The reality is the Labor Party left a massive black hole when they were turned out of office, and when the coalition government has sought to repair that, to repair the fiscal damage Labor has done, they have done nothing except oppose it—they have opposed savings and even sought to oppose savings of their own. They are opposing in the Senate now $1.2 billion of savings and revenue measures—measures which Labor had previously proposed but are now blocking. The fact is the Labor Party has never seen a tax increase they did not like and never seen a spending increase they did not love. The fact is that their inability to constrain themselves in government—their inability to live within their means—has left us with the fiscal challenge we have today.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the elements in Labor's savings, so-called, is of course changes to the so-called thin capitalisation rules for multinationals. I refer to the answer I gave a moment ago when I reminded the House that when the coalition presented solid provisions to take on multinational tax avoidance, which are already reaping dividends for the ATO, which are already providing a measure of justice for hardworking Australian businesses, what did the Labor Party do? They opposed them. What did they have instead? A so-called thin capitalisation proposal which the Treasury has advised would hurt the economy, crimp investment and cost jobs. Labor do not understand fiscal discipline and they do not understand business.</span>

In Goulburn, for example, the biggest centre, some 10,000 premises are to be connected to the fibre to the node network.</span>

                  </a>  How big a piece of paper would have been needed to announce what Labor delivered on the NBN in its time in government? I think this postage stamp would have been too big—blank space would have been left when you listed what Labor delivered. Frankly, you would need to go to the frontiers of nanotechnology to find a small enough piece of paper to list Labor's achievements in Hume or nationally on the National Broadband Network. Across Hume, in the Wollondilly and Wingecarribee areas, in The Oaks, in Oakdale, in Bundanoon and in the towns of Picton, Bargo and Tahmoor, all of these areas are receiving fibre to the node or fixed wireless and the effective work of the member for Hume in advocating for the needs of his constituents when it comes to communications is extremely impressive. It is the coalition that understands the rural and regional telecommunications needs of this country; it is the coalition which is delivering. We have now 1.65 million premises able to receive a service. When Labor left office the number was a derisory 348,000, and thanks to the competence being delivered by the NBN, thanks to the work done by the former Minister for Communications, thanks to the work being done by the Abbott and Turnbull governments and thanks to the advocacy of committed regional members like the member for Hume, the Australian people are getting better broadband all around the country. Labor made wild promises—the coalition is delivering.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TURNBULL:</span>
                  </a>  This law and these changes were designed to deal precisely with multinational companies shifting profits around the world and avoiding tax. It was part of an OECD and G20 combined effort to address this type of multinational tax avoidance. These big multinational companies have access, as I said earlier today, to mechanisms and arrangements that are not available to Australian taxpayers, to ordinary Australian businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this law provides is that businesses with a turnover of over $1 billion have to report how much tax they pay in every jurisdiction so that everybody will know how much they are paying. And when we look, under the new law, as to whether an arrangement is designed to avoid tax, instead of the old provision—which had been, obviously, the law of the land under the Labor government and previous governments—the purpose being that it had to have a sole or dominant test of tax avoidance, the new test is that tax avoidance is 'one of the principal purposes'. That makes it much, much more straightforward for the ATO to levy tax. The level of penalties has been doubled. The jurisdictions to which the laws used to apply were basically limited to no-tax or very-low-tax tax havens. Now, that restriction is no longer there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what the law did was give the Australian Taxation Office the 21st century tools to combat ingenious 21st century tax avoidance to collect that money. That is what the law did, and the Labor Party voted against it. They voted against it. They lined up with the multinational tax dodgers. They stood in the way of the ATO collecting the money we need for schools, for hospitals and for roads. They have no shame. They have lined up with the tax dodgers.</span>

In responding to his question, I repeat and echo the words of the Prime Minister, who has very well put out the case as to how the government has acted to put in place legislation which is now in effect from 1 January to do all of the things the Prime Minister has said. Those opposite voted against it. They voted against it in the other place. They voted against it in this place. They put forward a measure which they claimed—although they will not release their assumptions or costings on it in any way, shape or form—will raise $1.9 billion over the budget and forward estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they will be pleased to know this: based on what this government is already doing, and has been doing, in the area of combating multinational tax, during the 2015 financial year the ATO completed around 50 audits and 350 reviews of multinationals which raised $2.5 billion—in one year. What this government did was actually produce $2.5 billion in additional revenue by going after multinationals that were not paying their fair share of tax—and that was before the laws were introduced. Now, we have gone from 30 companies—30 companies we were looking at before that legislation—to 80 companies. Let me go further. The ATO still has 45 audits in progress, of which 12 are technology companies and three are in the pharmaceutical industry. The companies under audit are the household names you hear about—Chevron, Origin Energy, GlaxoSmithKline, Apple, Microsoft, Google, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. They have all reported that they are under audit for these things. In the courts, the ATO is challenging aggressive arrangements. The tax office successfully challenged in court and received positive decisions in respect of both Chevron and Orica last year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite gasbag about it, but when it comes to voting on it they vote against it. On this side of the House, we say what we mean; we mean what we say. We put laws into this place which say we are going to make multinationals pay tax on the income they earn. People know that we mean that because we have put the laws in place and the resources into the ATO to make sure they can do just that. Two point five billion dollars in outcomes last year—of getting that revenue out of the multinationals—demonstrates what the government is doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are deadly serious about this. We are outraged, like Australians are. But we are not just going to be outraged about it; we are going to do something about it—and we are doing something about it. We are getting the results, while those opposite just keep gasbagging.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  Of all the areas where the Prime Minister's rhetoric falls short of the reality of his delivery, education is surely foremost amongst them. This Prime Minister, there is no doubt, talks the good talk. This Prime Minister is good at the rhetoric. This Prime Minister is good at the spin. He waxes about the importance of innovation and about the importance of education for our future. He says nice things. He tells us—he even lectures us—that there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian. But the reality is that this Prime Minister, who has the responsibility for preparing for the future of our economy, is more than happy to send Australian young people into this rapidly changing world without the skills they deserve, without the investment they need. This Prime Minister is more than happy to keep the education funding policies he inherited from his predecessor. This Prime Minister is more than happy to say to Australia's young people, 'We will not invest more in you in this rapidly changing world.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He tells us 'there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian'. That was his quote. I want to share with the House a couple of other quotes. They are not from him. They are a touch longer, I apologise to the House. They are longer, but they are not glib; they are important. One is from a very good recent book called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Machine Age</span> by two authors, Brynjolfsson and McAfee. They say this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Technological progress is going to leave behind some people … as it races ahead. … there's never been a better time to be a worker with special skills or the right education, because these people can use technology to create and capture value. However, there's never been a worse time to be a worker with 'ordinary' skills and abilities to offer, because computers, robots and other digital technologies are acquiring these skills and abilities at an extraordinary rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has never been a worse time not to have the investment in the education you need. The Prime Minister might want to consider that point. It is not about glib words. It is not about slogans. It is about investment in the future, and the Prime Minister is more than happy to let it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nouriel Roubini, one of the world's finest economists, said this, putting it slightly more concisely:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Software innovation, together with 3D printing technologies, will open the door to those workers who are educated enough to participate; for everyone else, however, it may feel as though the revolution is happening elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this world there will be winners and losers, and this Prime Minister is prepared—he is more than happy—to see so many young Australians be the losers, because he is not prepared to take the decision to invest in them. He inherited an education policy which he now presides over—it is his policy—which sees $3.2 million cut from every Australian school, the equivalent of sacking one in seven teachers, less individual support for students, fewer subject choices and literacy and numeracy projects cut. I know I have had school principals from my electorate come to see me to talk about the good things they have started to do with their improved funding already. Every honourable member will have had the same. But those programs will be cut unless the money flows. Those early stage projects that are just making a difference—bringing technology into schools, lifting up people who are the most disadvantaged—will be cut on this Prime Minister's watch, and no amount of words, no rhetoric from him will change that. No slogans from him will help those people who will have their projects cut. This is the policy which he personally presides over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be very clear: this is a matter of fairness, this is a matter of social justice. Better and fairer education funding is what drives all of us on this side of the House, and it is what brought many of us into politics. It is not just about fairness though; it is about very important economic policy preparing Australia for the future, because we know we are not doing well enough. We know that, in Australia, disadvantaged students are up to three years behind other students in educational outcomes. That is not good enough. We know that, in Australia, rural and regional students are up to 12 months behind students in metropolitan areas. That is not fair. That is not good enough, and we are prepared to do something about it, even if those members opposite who represent rural and regional areas are not. We know that the range between the lowest and highest mathematical literacy scores in Australia is higher than the OECD average, and that is not good enough. That is not acceptable to us, it should not be acceptable to any member of this House, and it should certainly not be acceptable to this Prime Minister who talks the talk but is not prepared to do anything about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, in Australia, the difference in educational outcomes between those in the lowest quintile of socioeconomic status and the highest is 2½ years. That is just not on in Australia. It is not fair, it is not right and it is not acceptable, and it is very poor for our future, because those people who do not come from the richest families, who do not have the wealthiest backgrounds have a lot to contribute to this nation. They are no less intelligent than any other Australian. They do not have one bit less to offer Australia. They can play just as much of a role in our economic future as any other Australian. But all they need is a bit of investment—the same investment that every other Australian gets. They deserve nothing less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a great myth, a great fallacy—we heard it from this Prime Minister yet again today. His education minister has been saying it right across the country: more money into education does not make a difference and investment does not make a difference. That is a fallacy. That is just not right, and we are not going to cop that for a second. Tell that to the Australian mums and dads who are scrimping and scraping to put more money into their kids' education. Tell them that more money does not make a difference. You tell that to the teachers in rural Australia, in Western Sydney, in Western Melbourne and right across the country who are trying to find more resources for their classrooms, who are holding fetes and cake stalls. You tell them that more money does not make a difference to the education they can provide to their students. That is an insult from this Prime Minister and this education minister, and it is a convenient mistruth that they peddle to justify their callous disregard for better education funding in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our 'Your Child. Our Future' policy is very important economic policy for our future. We know that, according to the OECD, in 2000 only one country outperformed Australia in reading and maths, and in 2006 only two countries outperformed us in science. Today 16 countries are outperforming us in maths, nine in reading and seven in science. We are falling behind! We are going backwards. This government is presiding over a decline in investment which will see us do worse—and they tell us money does not matter! Money is not the only thing that matters—other things matter as well—but the Prime Minister should dare not pretend that money does not matter when it comes to investment in education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that 75 per cent of the fastest-growing occupations in Australia today require science, technology, engineering and maths. We have policies to deal with that; the Leader of the Opposition announced them last year. We were talking about this when the now Prime Minister was still defending his predecessor's callous lack of regard for science, technology, engineering and maths. The Prime Minister should acknowledge that this is a necessary investment. He should not lecture Australians about how there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian, but acknowledge that the policies he is presiding over will see us get this wrong. He should acknowledge that the policies he is presiding over will continue to see us go backwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the OECD has said this: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the quality of schooling in a country is a powerful predictor of the wealth that countries will produce in the long run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pretty obvious: if you invest in education now, you create wealth into the future. They have also said that, if we equip all Australian high school students with the basic skills they need, by 2030 we could add $44 billion to the size of our economy. The government, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say we cannot afford this. But we say we cannot afford not to invest in education. They see cost; we see investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had to make difficult decisions to make room in the budget to fund this. We have developed $70 billion worth of savings over the decade to fund this and other measures,. But so we should, because this has to be an urgent national priority. We will not accept the myth that the Prime Minister perpetuates: that money does not count in education. I wanted to see what the Prime Minister thought of education. I read the recent biography on him; I thought that maybe he would said something about education in it. I found one quote. It said this: 'Most federal politicians are incredibly uneducated. The ALP is much better educated these days than the Liberals.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said that before he joined the Liberal Party. We accept the compliment. His people skills are gathering votes in the Liberal party room! But I will tell you what we do know: we do know that investment counts in education. We do know that, if you take money out of our education system, Australia's young people will be the losers. We do know that this is happening under this Prime Minister's watch, and we do know that we will not stand for it. We will fix it on coming to office, even if this Prime Minister refuses to.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  I want to thank the shadow Treasurer for today's MPI on education. I am looking forward to the opposition reshuffle when it comes; he is getting his credentials on education early! But I do think it is an indication that the shadow Treasurer has completely abandoned the economic argument that needs to underpin the national conversation we are having at the moment. Last year we had several MPIs on tax and on the economy. But the first MPI the shadow Treasurer has chosen to lead this year is completely outside of his portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a reason for that. If you think about the presentation of the shadow Treasurer calmly, there are a number of points you might want to note. The shadow Treasurer sets up a construct in terms of education funding in Australia that is completely a false dichotomy. He tries to make a case that this government will not fund education at all, and that his government—if they are ever elected to office—will somehow endlessly fund education in a way that they do not have to explain or make credible or sustainable. It is completely not the case. As the Prime Minister outlined in question time today, this government is investing record levels of funding in Australia. Anybody who has looked at the budget papers and this situation objectively would acknowledge that Commonwealth spending on education is at record levels. It is higher than ever before and is set to increase, year on year, over the forward estimates. It was spelt out many times in question time. So why would an opposition party suggest that somehow a government is cutting funding when funding is increasing? Why would they suggest there are chronic education shortfalls when there is actually a record level of spending?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is because it is a hard business to tell the Australian people that the Commonwealth borrows money every single day to fund the ordinary expenditure of government. We do not have any money. We borrow money every single day to fund the ordinary expenditure of government. The Labor Party does not want to be honest with the Australian people and say that there are serious matters in education that need to be tackled. We did not hear one word cross the shadow Treasurer's lips about the serious issues that need tackling in education. We did not hear about teacher quality—not once. We did not hear about giving school principals autonomy to make decisions to improve educational outcomes. We did not hear about engaging parents in education, and we certainly did not hear anything about strengthening the curriculum.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the opposition's approach in relation to education? It is the same as their approach in every other area—spend, spend, spend. If I can paraphrase the shadow Treasurer, today he said, 'Let the spending flow. Let the money flow'. It is an ALP policy. It is a new idea in the year of ideas—let the money flow! What an election slogan—you could put that on a corflute! Here is Chris Bowen—and I can see it down in Blaxland now: 'Let the money flow. Double or nothing!' But where is it going to come from?</span>

Even Paul Keating suggests that the world has trimmed us down and we have to make cuts. We have to be honest with the Australian people about our budgetary challenge.

The Grattan Institute's John Daley said:</span>

Everyone I am looking at, right now, knows that using tobacco excise is lazy, is not going to work and will not fund the massive increase in expenditure that you are putting forward to the Australian people.

                <span class="HPS-Small">We want to tax tobacco so heavily that its consumption in this country will fall," he said. "Therefore this revenue should not then be relied upon to fund longer-term spending commitments."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not matter who you go to, on what side of the economic fence they fall. They are all united in saying that this is not a way to fund recurrent education funding of the future. It will not work. It will not meet the amounts that the shadow Treasurer is talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer has the hide to come in here and say, simply, 'Spend more money. Let the money flow,' to paraphrase him. Let whose money flow, shadow Treasurer? You are talking about the Australian people's money. You are talking about money the Commonwealth does not have. If you do not have a plan to fund your education for the future, you have nothing. You have come to the Australian people and said, 'We want to reduce smoking in Australia. We want to eliminate smoking in Australia. We want it to fall. We want the revenue to fall. But we are going to use it to fund our children's future.' That is the whole basis of your education policy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you believe that is sustainable, let's go doorknocking and explain it to the Australian people in your electorate, McMahon, or anywhere else you decide to run after this redistribution. Let's go down and tell them that you are funding our kids' futures on an increase in the tobacco excise, which you hope will fall. It is completely unsustainable—like every Labor policy proposal put forward. It certainly is not the year of big ideas. It is not a big idea to increase the tobacco excise. It is not a sustainable way to fund our children's futures. It is, simply, another thought bubble from the shadow Treasurer.</span>

Now that the initial first-day jitters are over for parents and the kids are back at school, I want to let families in my electorate know just how Labor's 'Your Child.

                  </a>  Please, potato head, be quiet. Every time you speak you just make things worse. It means that $4.5 billion will be invested into the education system over the 2018 and 2019 school years and a total of $37.3 billion for the package over the decade. The 'Your Child. Our Future' plan focuses on children's needs by ensuring there is more individual attention and support for students with special learning needs. It means targeted resources and better equipped classrooms. It means our teachers will have greater support with access to quality resources and training. The Liberals will argue that we cannot afford to invest in education and only cuts will do. But I argue that we cannot afford not to invest in education, in our kids and in our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2014-15 budget the Abbott-Turnbull government revealed a $30 billion cut to all Australian schools over the next decade by abandoning the needs based funding model beyond 2017. For schools in the electorate of McEwen, these cuts are equivalent to sacking one in seven teachers, cutting the average school budget by $3.2 million and providing about $1, 000 less support per student per year. The impact of these cuts is real. They would be enough to employ 221 extra teachers every year over the next 10 years in the seat of McEwen alone. The Turnbull government's school funding policy not only means that our schools will not be resourced to improve standards but also means that schools will actually go backwards. Without investment in our schools, TAFEs and universities, the Prime Minister's waffle about innovation and the future economy is just all fluff. The Turnbull government has no plan to fix the crisis it has created in schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving Australia's education system is the most important prerequisite to building innovation and preparing Australians for the jobs of the future. Already 75 per cent of the fastest-growing occupations today require skills in science, technology, engineering and maths—STEM. And employment in STEM occupations is projected to grow at almost twice the pace of other occupations. Modernising our education system is essential so that our kids can be empowered and can be productive and active participants in the global economy, which is facing rapid technological change; 3-D printers, automation and robotics are advancing at an ever-increasing pace, creating enormous opportunities for economies that make the right policy choices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this environment of rapid technological change also presents significant risk for countries and economies that do not make the right choices, that do not understand the challenges and that do not invest in the right things for the future. Labor has accepted the risk and has released its plan to ensure that we are in a position to meet those future workforce challenges head-on. That is because Labor understands that, without comprehensive investment in education, advances in technology will see a further hollowing out of middle- and low-level jobs, further increasing inequality. And that is unacceptable to Labor. We are committing to fund a permanent and ongoing shift to needs based funding in our schools because every child in every school should be equipped with the basic skills to secure the jobs of the future. It is what parents want, it is what teachers want and it is what students need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's 'Your Child. Our Future' plan will drive opportunity, innovation and the economy through education. The 'Your Child. Our Future' reforms will ensure that all children, no matter what their socioeconomic background is, will get the best start in life and the opportunity to succeed in the rapidly changing global economy. Labor's 'Your Child. Our Future' plan gives families a clear choice, because only Labor will invest in our children's futures to ensure that they have the opportunities going forward as we move further into the 21st century. What we have is a clear choice: an opposition that is prepared to stand up for kids, stand up for families and stand up for education, or a government that is consistent in only one thing: saying one thing before an election and doing something completely opposite after.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:40</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise today to speak on this MPI on education funding. I think we all recognise that education is critically important for the future of our country, and certainly on this side of the House we well recognise that. We have listened to the contribution from the member for McMahon and the member for McEwen, wanting to lecture us on a failure to invest in education when it was the previous, Labor, government—many of whom are still sitting on those opposition benches in this House—that failed Australian schools with an unfair and inconsistent funding model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, some of them I know are a bit newer in this place, so I might give them a bit of a history lesson. The previous, Labor, government's negotiation with education authorities resulted in special deals and indefinite and complex transitions that compromised what was intended to be a fair, consistent and needs based national funding model. In Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, Labor removed more than $1.2 billion in funding from government schools. Why are the students of these states worth less to Labor than those in the other states? How can Labor say it cares about the future of our children when it has left an epic budget deficit and wants to add more to it? Labor promises $37 billion in spending with no legitimate plan to fund it. Our country is in deep deficit thanks to the previous, Labor, government spending like drunken sailors: months out from an election and Labor has already racked up a $50 billion black hole thanks to unfunded promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The students of today are the leaders of tomorrow, and they will not be thanking uncle Bill for a budget deficit that they will be paying off for generations to come. That is a little bit of information that those opposite fail to tell the Australian people, but at some point in the future the bill will need to be paid, and it will be the students being educated today who are going to pay the bill in the future. Labor is bound to continue to make all sorts of promises and repeat mistakes from the past in relation to education policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government has matched and exceeded the former government's funding over four years from 2014 to 2017. It is false and misleading to suggest that this government is not investing in education when we have provided record funding of some $69.5 billion over the forward estimates, including $5 billion in record funding for students with disabilities. From 2014 to 2015 education funding increased by some $4.1 billion, or 27.9 per cent. Under the coalition, funding to government schools has increased by 36.1 per cent and to non-government schools by 23.4 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I stated earlier, Labor failed the students of Australia with their poor negotiations and funding complexities with educational authorities when they were last in government. As usual, the reason we get outcomes on this side of the House when we are in government is that we are actually prepared to sit down and talk to people and come up with sensible solutions for the problems we face both in the long term and in the short term. Prior to 2018, this government—provided we are still in government after the next election—will sit down with the states, territories and the non-government school sector to talk about how we can improve student outcomes and what needs to change to ensure that when students leave school they will be well equipped to get a job, undertake vocational education, attend university or other studies. We want schools to be able to plan for the longer term. The government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s negotiations will be about the next full funding period from 2018 to 2021. This government is focused on four key areas that will make a real difference to students: teacher quality, school autonomy, engaging parents in education and strengthening the curriculum. These are areas that we know will actually make difference to student outcomes. As usual, it is this government that is providing solutions to these long<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">-</span>term problems. </span>

I came here as a former teacher—someone with an ongoing interest in education. Having worked in remote communities, I have observed and understood what education means to people who live in the bush. What we know is that if you live in the bush, if you live in remote parts of Australia, your educational outcomes are going to be poorer than those who live in the city. Your health outcomes are going to be poorer. Your job opportunities are going to be poorer. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Prime Minister here this afternoon in question time talking about a high wage economy, higher quality jobs and how we have to be at the forefront of innovation. These are his words. Let me remind the Prime Minister: you will not be at the forefront of innovation if you cannot ensure that every child in this country has equal access to a good educational outcome—you cannot. People will not get good jobs, higher quality jobs, unless every child in this country has access to a good and sound education. You will not have people becoming entrepreneurs and setting up small businesses, unless you can guarantee that every child in this country has equal access to a good educational outcome. The fact is that the Gonski reforms provided that opportunity for Australian students across the country, regardless of where they lived, regardless of their postcode—whether they lived in the eastern suburbs of Sydney or in 0870 in the Northern Territory. That is important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is most important to me is what will happen when this funding is withdrawn, after the $30 billion cuts are made post 2017. It will have a dramatic, negative effect upon the outcomes of Aboriginal students in remote parts of the Northern Territory, who suffer the worst educational outcomes in this country. What we know is that education is not only good for getting jobs; education is not only good for getting access to higher education, a good school education; but education also guarantees a better health outcome. We see people living longer. People do not often make this connection, but it is very clear. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in remote parts of Australia there are high numbers of students with FASD and other mental health issues. The funding cuts which are being made by this government will effectively mean that the support services that these kids require, that their families require, to get a better educational outcome will be gone. So let's forget the bluff and bluster. Let's forget the overbearing rhetoric of the Prime Minister. The facts are very different. They are interested in teacher quality. They are interested in school autonomy. These sorts of things are important but not as important as making sure that every kid, every school, has the resources it needs to get the educational outcomes that we would expect for every family in this country. What this government is doing is guaranteeing that needs based funding will not apply after 2017. We know the significant importance of having additional resources in schools. Money does make a difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The capital that the former Labor government put into schools—the building infrastructure in schools around this country—had a very significant impact on educational outcomes and educational opportunities for people living in remote and rural Australia. I know this. People who live in the bush know this. Yet we have got this government saying money is not an issue. Money is an issue. Money is a significant issue. We have now got the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory coming out in an article in today<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s <span style="font-style:italic;">NT News</span>: 'Education: epic fail fears', because of cuts in funding. He is right. Of course, what he is driven to do as a result of the pernicious attitude of this government is to say: 'How do we raise the additional income we require?' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory is a mendicant community. Around 80 per cent of their budget revenue is derived from the Commonwealth. What they are being forced to do now is consider a GST increase. This is the poorest part of Australia, who can least afford a GST increase. They already pay more tax than anyone else because of the GST on goods and services that already applies: they pay higher costs. So now there is a double whammy. You either accept the government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s requirement and the government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s attitude or you lose the support—and that is what is happening in this case. The government should be condemned. </span>

One thing that I will always fight for is the schools in my area. I go into many of my schools and I have built a very good working relationship with them. One thing I do support is needs based funding. Going into the schools in my area—and we have a lot of low socioeconomic areas—and seeing these kids, I want to make sure that they have the same opportunity as kids on the North Shore, which is only an hour away from my electorate. </span>

                  </a>  We have not cut funding to schools. Obviously, the member for Perth was not listening in question time. There is a record $69.4 billion in total Commonwealth funding over the forward estimates, representing an increase of 27.3 per cent in funding from 2014-15. We have not cut funding. It is very important that we do provide that support to the teachers. In Dobell, I have amazing teachers and they do a fantastic job. But the reality is that a lot of them are not interested in the rhetoric from the Teachers Federation. They roll their eyes when they mention to me a particular union organiser who comes through the schools. They are interested in their kids—and that is what I am interested in too. They are interested in seeing these kids have a fair go and get an education, not listening to the rhetoric and lies of the unions—your union masters. On the Central Coast, they are already putting out flyers about what they are going to be campaigning on at the next election—and, surprise surprise, it is penalty rates, GST and Gonski. These are the same people who have wasted thousands of dollars on a debate over the China free trade agreement that never happened. These are the same people who do a photo shoot outside my office; they take their photos and then they run around the corner and have coffee—and they put it on their credit card. I am not going to talk about credit cards, I am going to talk about education and giving schools a fair go. So stop your lies. All it is is lies. Tell the truth to the families. Tell the truth to the kids.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget the Labor legacy. A lot of these kids spent six years of their formative education under Labor. We know that there is an issue with a lot of kids leaving school these days in regard to literacy and numeracy. I talk to a lot of employers in Dobell about the barriers to employing young people, and the common theme is their literacy and numeracy. So we ask the question, 'What is going on?' And I know that both sides are saying, 'What is going on with our kids when they are leaving school with poor literacy and numeracy?' The teachers out there are doing a great job—they really are. You cannot say it is due to a lack of funding because they have been given the funding.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the schools in Dobell, like those at Brook Avenue and The Entrance, have received a lot of money, which they are putting to use to give their kids an opportunity. They are great schools. Schools like Wyong Creek, Narara, Wyong High School and Wyong Public School, schools that had been written off by the Labor government, now have a member who is actually in the schools talking to them. The ALP hate that. They hate coalition members who are actually interested in education and interested in their local schools. Nothing gets Twitter or Facebook going like the ALP trolls when they see a coalition member in the schools doing a great job. They absolutely cannot stand it and they cannot cope with it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  The Turnbull Liberal-National government has failed to properly invest in education and it has failed to ensure that Australians are ready for the jobs of the future. On this side of the House, we know that education makes a real difference to people's lives. For individuals, it opens the door to jobs and opportunity, and for our country it builds prosperity and a secure economy. We all know that education is the key to preparing our children for those jobs of the future, and the Turnbull government has failed over and over to provide those opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At all levels of education—whether its schools, universities or TAFE—this government has repeatedly cut and repeatedly failed. Rural and regional students are hardest hit by these cuts. In regional Australia we blame the National Party for these cuts because National Party choices hurt, and cutting funding has hurt the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we look at the cuts, let's remember back to the last election, with all those Liberal Party and National Party candidates running around promising there would be no cuts to education. During the campaign they were all out there saying they were on an 'absolute unity ticket when it comes to school funding'. That was their pre-election promise. In my area, all the National Party candidates were out there saying that. As soon as they got into government, what did they do? They cut that funding. So it turned out to be another broken promise, another lie, in the lead-up to the election. It shows that they just cannot be trusted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this government has only one policy when it comes to schools, and that is to rip $30 billion of funding out of our schools. I said that National Party choices hurt—$30 billion really hurts, especially in the country. Let's have a look at the history of the Abbott-Turnbull government's failure to properly invest in education. In the 2014-15 budget, they had that $30 billion funding cut to all Australian schools over the next decade. This not only destroys the needs based funding model; it also fails to even keep up with historic trends in the cost of education. Let's look at exactly what these cuts mean. They mean an average cut of $3.2 million per school, which is the same as sacking one in seven teachers; less individual support; fewer subject choices; less support for students with a disability; cuts to literacy and numeracy programs; and less training and support for teachers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet at the same time as we have these cuts we are also seeing Australia's educational rankings falling backwards. According to OECD data, in the year 2000, only one country outperformed Australia in reading and maths, and in 2006 only two countries outperformed Australia in science. But today 16 countries outperformed Australia in maths, nine countries outperformed Australia in reading and seven countries outperformed Australia in science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that education is not just a policy about equity and fairness; it is also a policy for economic growth. Only Labor has a plan to properly invest in education. Our plan, 'Your Child. Our Future', represents the most significant improvement and investment in education in Australia for two generations. We believe that every child should have the same chance of succeeding at school no matter their background, no matter where they live and no matter what type of school they go to—government, independent or Catholic. 'Your Child. Our Future' means the Gonski funding and reforms will be delivered on time and in full, and this reverses the Turnbull government's harsh cuts. 'Your Child. Our Future' will see an additional investment in our education system of $4.5 billion over years 5 and 6 of the Gonski reforms and $37.3 billion over the decade, a massive investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment will see every child in every school funded on the basis of need, and a permanent improvement in the schools system. The plan ensures a strong focus on every child's needs; more individual attention for students; better trained teachers; more targeted resources and better equipped classrooms; and more support for students with special learning needs. When I look at my electorate of Richmond, every student in every school will get the support they need to reach their full potential under our plan. That is important right across the country, but especially in regional and rural seats. They desperately need to have funding such as this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this is in incredibly stark contrast to the Liberal-National cuts to education, which have had a very severe impact in the regions. I will just talk about my electorate for a minute. The school cuts in my electorate of Richmond will rip $176 million out of the electorate over the next 10 years—a huge amount—meaning children in regional areas like mine will not get the opportunities to meet their full potential. When it comes to regional Australia, only Labor will invest in schools. The Prime Minister, his Liberals and his Nationals will just cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the next election, once again there will be a very clear choice when it comes to education: invest in our children and our nation's future with Labor—we understand the importance of investing in education—or you will just get more of the same cuts to education under the Liberals and Nationals. The fact is that National Party choices hurt, particularly National Party cuts to education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="96430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EWEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. My wife is an early childhood teacher and my younger brother is a high school teacher and now primary school principal, and he has been a principal in secondary schools as well. My thoughts on education and my work with the education committee have been assisted by both of those people with their varying views on education, but also by being involved in school communities over 10 years with my kids going through the school system. I say for the record that there is no way in the world that I could ever become a teacher. I lasted one day as a brickie's labourer; I lasted half a day as a builder's labourer; I would not last until little lunch as a teacher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have stated that teacher quality is a key thing that we want to drive toward, and I believe that is so. Having a wife who is a teacher, I see the hours that teachers put in. The notion that teachers have all these holidays is a complete furphy. They work during most of the holidays. Every Sunday, my wife and her co-teacher were going through individual plans for their children. What drives them most is not the pay or anything like that; what drives them most is love for the children. That is what we have in this country, by and large: we have teachers in our system who actually love children. As I said before, I would not last 15 minutes as a teacher.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we want to do is make sure that, when we are graduating teachers, the right sorts of people are coming through. The last time I checked the numbers was in about 2014, so they may have varied. In those days, the dropout rate of teachers in the first two or three years, for whatever reason, was about 27 per cent. There are a lot of reasons for that, but that is over a quarter of the teachers who could graduate from university. There is the amount of money that all levels of government have provided to produce those teachers and the investment to get teachers out there. To have a quarter of your cohort completely disengage from the education system tells you how stressful being a teacher is. When I was in primary school was a long time ago and school was different. Today's teachers have to be social workers, they have to be surrogate parents, they have to feed kids, they have to clothe kids and they have to take kids to the toilet. We have very serious issues here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the central point I want to make: we have two theories. One is Labor's theory: if you just throw more money at needs based education, you will drive better outcomes. Money has been thrown at education without any concern for outcomes since 1972 when Gough Whitlam got to power, and including all governments. It has been shown that throwing money at education without demanding things from a federal level and without demanding some sort of return is not the way to go. We need to focus on making sure that teachers in classrooms are properly prepared so they can get things done. We have to make sure that parents are engaged and that, when something goes wrong in the classroom, the teacher is not the one they blame and the school is not blamed; that they look to what their children is doing and they participate in bringing their children to school. We have to make sure that principals are able to make decisions around their school with their school community. If you engage with those things and you make the decision as close to the coalface as you possibly can, you will get a better decision. That is the basis of what we are trying to do. Freeing up the curriculum is my personal pledge. I just do not see the point in trying to teach a preschooler geography when they cannot read, write or grip a pencil. There are so many things that we could do in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is failure at all levels of government in letting our education standards slip: allowing kids to get to high school when they cannot read or write; refusing to fail kids because it might hurt their feelings; and being attacked by parents. This says to us that it is not going to be cured by just throwing money at it. We are investing a lot of money. We are all investing a lot of money. We have a different approach, but that is all it is: a different approach. I think we all care about education and we should all care about education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="WF6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  Since September last year when the member for Warringah was blindsided by his loyal deputies, the Australian public learnt two lessons about the Prime Minister. First, we learnt he is good at talking. He does his shtick with the media and the common people while gesticulating with his glasses in one hand. He is an antipodean; a patrician; a Francis Urquhart, or a Francis Underwood if you watch Netflix. Second, we have also learnt that Mr Turnbull does not follow through that about which he blathers. He likes to talk, but it is all hot air. He is all pop and no corn. In Melbourne we say: new show bag; same contents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the point of policy consistency, the Prime Minister was vociferously in favour of marriage equality—so much so that he pooh-poohed the previous Prime Minister's plebiscite plan. Now he insists to the parliament that he supports a plebiscite. He informs Paul Kelly today that there is no chance he will stand up to the social conservatives in his party and save the budget $160 million and a day at the polls. He will press ahead, even while his rebel backbenchers pledge to vote against the plebiscite whatever the result. Much like Prime Minister Abbott, Prime Minister Turnbull's government will not let public opinion get in the way of its policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise with tackling climate change; likewise with the republic. I was there when the republic committee saw Malcolm Turnbull, then a private citizen, leading the charge in 1999. As I asked on Sky recently, when are we going to see the real Malcolm? Now the member for Wentworth is faced with a dilemma. He leads a party that he does not represent and whose faithful do not back his stance on social issues, issues which we on this side of the House came to terms with long years ago. So the Prime Minister's preferred option is to talk, and, like all good barristers, he is good at that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view and the view of the opposition, the myriad challenges that Australia faces, challenges made worse by the environmental policies of those opposite, will only be surmounted by an educated Australian public and a well-funded quality education system. Unlike those opposite, all on this side of the House believe that every Australian has the right to and should have the benefit of a properly funded quality education system. What does Wentworth think? He tells us he thinks innovation is of vital importance but then pulls the rug from under the education system that will produce the next generation of innovators. The Prime Minister supported and now leads a government which has effectively removed $30 billion from the education system. This short-sighted saving to the budget bottom line leaves an education budget that will fail even to keep up with the historical trend of education costs. Education is an investment, not a cost. Mr Turnbull's education budget cuts mean an average cut of $3.2 million per school—the same as sacking 14 per cent of the teachers. Of course, that is why the Catholic education system has been so vociferous in <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Sydney Morning Herald</span> today, protesting the government's policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same mob, by the way, who said at the last election that they would not make any change to spending on education. Outside all schools there were posters—I well remember them—that said the Liberals would match Labor dollar for dollar on education spending. This is while OECD statistics show Australia is falling behind its peers. As others have noted, we were No. 2 in maths; now we are No. 10. As my colleagues have noted, not only are the Liberal cuts doing damage to Australia's education system today; by ignoring the changing dynamics of education and the global economy, we are hobbling our children and our country for tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor's alternative 'Your Child. Our Future' plan, the funding and reforms recommended by the expert panel led by Gonski will be delivered in full under a Labor government. These reforms will drive opportunity, innovation and the economy through education. They will help all Australian kids, no matter what their background, to get a better start in life and leave school with the tools needed to succeed in our rapidly-changing economy. Of course these changes are expensive. They are specifically funded by additions to the budget from multinational tax avoidance, from unsustainable superannuation tax concessions and from best-practice taxation in the tobacco area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, the difference is clear, particularly on this issue of education. Labor's policy is an example of conviction. We have demonstrated where it will be funded from. Labor talks and Labor acts; the Prime Minister just talks. New show bag; same contents.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="139441" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr O'DOWD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on today's MPI on the issue of education, an issue which is undoubtedly important to all members of the public. An effective education system is vital to ensure that we have a capable and intelligent workforce to fill the jobs of the future. It is critical to maintaining an internationally competitive economy. Above all else, we must provide a first-class education to our children. I am sure that all members of this House would agree on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party's attempts to discredit the coalition's commitment to education are based purely on fiction. The suggestion that the coalition government has failed to properly invest in education is baseless and untrue. This is clearly demonstrated by the record increases in Commonwealth funding over the forward estimates. The Turnbull government is committed to providing the highest level of need-based school funding—a record $69.5 billion over four years to 2018-19. This is an increase of $4 billion, or 27.3 per cent, from 2014-15 to 2018-19. This is pure scaremongering by the Labor Party. In my electorate alone, one school, Trinity College—I have been out there in the last 12 months—has benefited from two different funding programs amounting to about $1 million for the one school. Only last weekend, in Gladstone, the Queensland government, in their wisdom, announced a new high school for Calliope. So they do not see the threat of government cutbacks—otherwise, why would they be building more schools? It is not the case that there have been cutbacks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state governments tried to work with the Labor federal government when they were in power, but that all ended up in disaster too. Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory suffered unfair treatment by the then Gillard-Rudd government. This is the story we have; yet the Labor Party will not admit that we are doing a good job. They just hate the fact that we are succeeding. They hate the fact that you cannot just throw money at a problem to fix it. It will not fix it. It is naive to think that funding alone is the answer, but this is what they think. Past analysis has proven that increased funding does not necessarily lead to quality education and better outcomes. From 1987 to 2012, education spending increased 100 per cent, yet students' outcomes have consistently declined. The current school funding model, which Labor advocates to extend, was complex and contained serious inequities between the states, and I have already mentioned that Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory suffered under the Gillard-Rudd government. The previous government took the fair and well-intentioned recommendations of David Gonski and turned them into a quagmire of side-deals and one-off arrangements with the states, which failed to rectify historical funding imbalances between the states. So we had a situation where the states ran the schools and they could not even get their funding right to make sure that all states were equal in the handouts. The extension of this model is merely entrenching those inequities and results in some states being severely and unfairly disadvantaged, and I believe they are still suffering from those policies of the Gillard-Rudd regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government has already increased funding to some states that was removed by the previous Labor government. So we have tried to rectify that in our last 2½ years of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor scare proposal follows the classic Labor logic: if you have a problem, throw a bucket of money at it and hope it goes away. The proposal completely ignores the need for schools' autonomy and a needs based approach. Labor's addiction to spending at all costs is clearly evident in their latest school policy, which commits them to spending $37 billion on replicating their past mistakes. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PRENTICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  As I was saying, aggressive and militant union behaviour is commonplace. Site shutdowns, strike action and other industrial action occur regularly. Unlawful industrial action over safety issues is increasingly a Trojan Horse for union delegates' other purposes. We heard that it is not unusual for someone wishing to trigger a site shutdown to fabricate a safety incident, even tampering with electrical boards. Coercion and bullying are stock-in-trade for many union officials. Like the Federal Court, we know construction union representatives behave as if they are above the law, routinely ignoring court orders, and, through these improper practices, the CFMEU and other unions leverage even greater power to bring into effect an unlawful no-ticket no-start union recruitment policy and practice for head contractors and, through them, on to subcontractors and across the industry through pattern bargaining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some union delegates exercise control over what should otherwise be commercial decisions and even exert control over detailed operational issues, including whether a site operates beyond core hours, and procurement and tendering. There is ample evidence of subcontractors who are not retained by head contractors because they were not on a union-approved list. Indeed, this is what happened to many of my constituents. Some union bosses even extend the 'put it on the credit card' approach to proceeding with industrial action even if they know it is not permitted under the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like all Australians who have watched the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption unfold, we learned that coercion is a common feature of union behaviour in the construction industry. It can involve threats and intimidation, verbal abuse, and distribution of material making derogatory, belittling, untrue or defamatory statements about individuals and companies. We know union intimidation tactics involve threats of physical harm and, on occasion, physical assault.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CFMEU's treatment of some of my constituents is shamefully common across the building and construction industry in Australia. Non-CFMEU members are bullied and labelled 'scabs'. A retired couple who used their life savings to set up a shop in a local centre in my electorate tried to save money by doing their own fit-out. Their shop was picketed, and they were spat on, called 'scabs' and worse, and prevented from entering their own property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite know what has been going on for far too long. The silence and inaction by those who sit opposite also makes them complicit. The CFMEU's actions are often in open defiance of the Fair Work Act and Supreme Court orders, but, with no strong enforcement body, the unions continue to wreak havoc. Indeed, something I hope the new ABCC will look into is how court-ordered fines are paid, because I know of cases where the union had to write a cheque to a successful litigant, but the litigant did not bank it because of the threat of further reprisals if they did. This speaks volumes about the licentious attitude towards the law and absolute contempt for the courts, as well as the lawless culture, in some unions, especially the CFMEU.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2] restores the full power of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the funding that Labor took away. This bill brings back integrity to this industry. This bill upholds and promotes respect for the rule of law and ensures respect for the rights of all building industry participants. It contains provisions to ensure that unlawful action, including unlawful industrial action and unlawful pickets, are dealt with appropriately. The bill includes the ability for the courts to impose significant penalties for individuals and organisations that participate in unlawful action. Importantly, the bill provides an effective means for investigating and enforcing the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will be able to exercise their power to obtain information quickly and effectively without being hindered by unnecessary bureaucratic red-tape around the issue of examination notices. However, to ensure accountability and transparency, the use of these powers will continue to be reviewed and reported on by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The operation of the Australian Building and Construction Commission contributed to improved productivity in the construction and building sector. This bill encourages productivity and the pursuit of high levels of employment in the building and construction industry. It will ensure that the government's policy to deliver the infrastructure of the 21st century is delivered on time and on budget. This bill will create jobs and investment by ensuring employers and workers in the industry can get on with the job without fear of intimidation. The Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Building and Construction Work Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme are maintained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this bill there are also a number of changes from the original legislation that reflect the changing scope and practice in the building and construction industry. The definition of 'building work' in the bill includes off-site prefabrication of made-to-order components for parts of buildings, structures or works. The definition of 'building work' also includes the transporting or supplying of goods to be used in building work. This is a change from the previous ABCC legislation and is included to ensure that large resource construction projects cannot be indirectly disrupted through coordinated go-slows on the supply of materials to those projects. The bill also extends the geographic limits to the exclusive economic zone, and land above the continental shelf, which will bring the legislation into line with the Fair Work Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is poorly served by those who would simply outsource Australia's industrial relations policy and practice to serial offenders who have an attitude of indifference to compliance with the requirements of our laws. Australia cannot afford to have a building and construction industry that is inefficient and unstable. We must protect and maintain the rule of law, and, wherever possible, drive productivity and economic growth. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  The member for Ryan and I agree on many things within this parliament. I respect her for the position she takes on many health issues and many other issues, but it is when you come down to an issue such as this that you can really see the difference between her beliefs and mine. It is the same with the government and the opposition. I find this legislation to be totally untenable. I think it goes to the heart of what we on this side of the parliament believe in, and it goes to the heart of why I am a member of this parliament. I am a member of this parliament to stand up for the rights of everybody in my electorate—for the rights of workers. In a past life I spent a lot of time working with those who were injured, and, surprise surprise, one of the largest groups of those who were injured were workers. Another surprise is that many of those workers were injured because of poor safety standards in the workplace, because of employers making sure that unions did not have access to the workplace. They were caused because of workers being put in dangerous situations and because employers were really bypassing every requirement that needed to be taken. The innate problem I have with this legislation is the one-sided nature of it. I do not know how we as a parliament could possibly support this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill was bad legislation when it was first introduced, in November 2013, and it is still bad legislation. No matter what the government does to it, is it still bad legislation. It is legislation driven by ideologues in the government who are consumed with hatred of unions and, I would have to say, workers, or have a total disregard for workers and their safety and for ensuring that they can have a decent standard of living, can be proud of their work and can have decent wages. Unfortunately, I think those on the other side are not too fussed about the kind of conditions workers have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of its rhetoric and diatribe is based on its past prejudices, this flawed legislation and the flawed findings of the trade union royal commission, which looked in a jaundiced way at unions, whilst turning a blind eye to the corrupt behaviour by many employers. That was totally ignored—the exploitation was totally ignored. It was not in the terms of reference that were given to the trade union royal commission. It was looking at one thing and one thing only. I know that there were instances where unions and witnesses before the royal commission tried to raise issues of safety and bad practice by employers, but they were told it was irrelevant. The royal commission was about getting the unions. It is interesting that we had Labor leader after Labor leader hauled before the royal commission, with no adverse findings given against them. So, to me, it really smelt like witch-hunt. It was all about the government chasing its agenda and maybe setting the groundwork for a 2016 election. When we look at corrupt behaviour by employers we are really looking at situations that actually place workers lives in jeopardy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a past life I worked with many workers who were injured on worksites and who were asked to undertake duties that were unsafe. They were told that if they did not do it they would not have a job. There was a lack of protection. You only have to look at the safety records of the building and construction industry to see that it is the industry that has the second greatest number of fatalities. What this government is doing in this legislation is going to make the industry less safe. I really care about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Senator Madigan said earlier this week that he has not had any constituents come to see him about trade unions. I am in a similar situation. I have not had one constituent come and see me about corrupt behaviour by the CFMEU. I have, however—and this may shock members on the other side of this parliament—had numerous workers in the construction industry come and see me about the fact that there is sham contracting, that they are not getting proper wages, that their employers have not paid their superannuation and that they are in a very vulnerable position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this legislation is not about that. This legislation is not about providing any protections. This legislation is about those on the other side of this House delivering to their masters and trying to create a scare campaign for the next election. I understand that the Prime Minister told his party room that, if this legislation does not get through, he will call a double dissolution. Well, I say to the Prime Minister: bring it on. The workers in Australia will really learn what this government's agenda is about—bringing back the ABCC, a Howard government brainchild. But they are bringing it back with bells and whistles. It is an enhanced version of the ABCC. It is a version that will actually erode even more levels of accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no doubt that the trade union royal commission discovered some serious and unacceptable behaviour. Labor in no way supports those behaviours. Illegal behaviour should be dealt with by legal authorities. Those people involved in such behaviour should be charged and then the courts should decide whether or not their behaviour was illegal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is looking at one industry, one tiny part of our economy and our society and one group of workers. It is seeking to put in place laws to deal with corruption in this industry. That is just untenable. Any laws to do with corrupt or illegal behaviour should cover everyone, not just the construction industry. I think that this government's intent to bring back the ABCC with its undemocratic powers and the impact it will have on workers' rights and safety and the way it will attack workers is totally untenable. It is something that I and those of us on this side of the House cannot support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this legislation is creating is akin to something in a police state. It is creating a situation where one group of people are having their rights stripped away from them. I as a member of this House, as an Australian and as somebody who is really concerned about what happens in the community I represent and throughout Australia cannot accept that. It is not Australian and it is not the way I like to see our country heading.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Labor we believe you put people first and that you at all times try to strengthen and protect the rights of workers. You have to make sure that workers have protections. If you have a situation where workers are protected then it will actually increase productivity in that industry. By creating a situation where that is not the case, you are going to have all sorts of cowboys out there. We should be cracking down on underpayment of workers. That is one problem that is very rampant in the industry and it is something that this government is not too concerned about. It is an area where there are a lot of employer cowboys operating. There should be a crackdown on the underpayment of workers by significantly increasing the penalty for employers who deliberately and systematically avoid paying their employees proper wages. We support moving away from a system where someone is given cash in the hand and told, 'If you turn up and say nothing then you have a job, but if you say something or ask for the correct pay and the right conditions of work then there will be no work available.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be ramping up the protections for workers from sham contracting by strengthening the legal protection of workers' entitlements, increasing penalties and giving the Fair Work Ombudsman more powers to ensure employers cannot liquidate their companies in order to avoid paying the money they owe to workers. That is a problem that has existed for a long time. I am sure something members on the other side of the House experience all the time is workers visiting their offices to tell the story of how their employer has changed the name of the company—just made a slight change—and by doing that has been able to avoid paying them the moneys that they are rightfully owed. That is unacceptable. We cannot support that. We will introduce reforms to ensure that temporary overseas workers are not being exploited and underpaid, and that there is a level playing field for all workers in Australia. The construction industry has, over a number of years, exploited overseas workers. There have been instances where worksites have been visited—yes, visited by union officials—and overseas workers have been found to be living in crowded conditions in shipping containers. I do not accept that. Why should we as a nation be prepared to support a regime that allows this to happen?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABCC governs civil, not criminal, behaviour. What has been identified in the royal commission relates to criminal behaviour. The government is seeking to put in place a civil regulator, not a criminal regulator. The ABCC had a record of operating in an aggressive, biased and coercive manner. It did not pursue or investigate breaches such as underpayment of wages, and there was no impartiality in the commission. And this is what we are going back to. This is the unacceptable practice this government has supported.</span>

No convictions came out of the Cole royal commission. The Royal Commissioner, Dyson Heydon, clearly had a conflict of interest, and there was a lot of bias in that royal commission.</span>

It is legislation that I believe will endanger the lives of Australian workers. It is legislation that will take away the rights of workers. I think those on the other side should think seriously about supporting. I do not.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  During the course of this debate on the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2] it is important not to forget the symbiotic relationship the Australian union movement has with the Australian Labor Party and the depths to which the ALP will stoop to keep their union masters happy. Since the release of the commission's findings, we have seen a campaign by the Labor Party to attack the report's credibility—we just heard an example of that from the previous speaker—and to attack the integrity of one of Australia's best regarded legal minds, in Commissioner Dyson Heydon. Labor's behaviour has been atrocious, and its defence of the union thuggery, outlined in the royal commission, shines a light on the ALP's rotten core. The Labor Party does not want to see the building unions or any other union reformed, because that would undermine its powerbase and the rivers of cash that flow from the union movement to the Labor Party year after year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Northern Territory the ties between the unions and Labor were spectacularly exposed last year with the release of a commission of inquiry report into the extremely dodgy handover of a former seafarer's shelter, known as the Stella Maris, that overlooks Darwin Harbour, only minutes from the CBD. The previous Territory Labor government, instead of going through a properly managed community consultation process, gifted, on the eve of the 2012 election, this wonderful site to Unions NT—their union mates. Unsurprisingly, when this was discovered by the incoming Country Liberal government an inquiry into exactly what took place was convened. It was presided over by John Lawler, who had a 35-year history in law enforcement in this country, including four years as CEO of the Australian Crime Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The findings were unambiguously bad for the Territory Labor Party and for Unions NT, but their default position on the negative findings was to attack Commissioner Lawler and the work of the Australian Crime Commission to take it out on him. However, repercussions from the inquiry eventually forced the resignation of the Labor Party's opposition leader, Delia Lawrie, and her deputy leader during this time, Gerry McCarthy, who was up to his neck in it, remains tarnished by the event today. The commission showed that the Labor Party was prepared to compromise hardworking Territory public servants, the Territory public service as a whole, and ignore the interests of the broader community just so it could pander to and do favours for its union mates. I think that behaviour is absolutely disgraceful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to put on record in this House some of the findings of the Stella Maris commission of inquiry. The findings stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 10 July 2012, a Cabinet Submission, number 4033: 'The future of the Stella Maris site—Lot 5260 Town of Darwin (1 McMinn Street)', went to the Northern Territory Cabinet for consideration. The submission was considered by only four of the eight Cabinet ministers … A decision was made to offer a Crown lease term over the site to Unions NT without an expression of interest process. This decision was against the strong and considered advice of the broader public sector not to grant the site to any community group without following an expression of interest process. Despite the fact he was sponsoring the submission, the Minister for Lands and Planning, Gerald McCarthy, was absent from the meeting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following the meeting, the department was advised of the Cabinet decision and began drafting the lease conditions and letter of offer for Minister G McCarthy to sign and send to Unions NT to meet his ministerial responsibilities under the Crown Lands Act. It is clear that, prior to and immediately following the Cabinet meeting, the department had little to no information about what Unions NT intended to do with the site.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The department believed there was an expectation to make the lease offer before the pre-election government caretaker period commenced on 6 August 2012 and, given the official Cabinet direction, acted with undue haste in processing Unions NT’s flawed community land grant application. This led to the department breaching its own processes for dealing with community land grants. The grant application the department processed was inaccurate, three years out of date and did not document Unions NT’s true intentions for the site. The department should have made the minister aware of exactly what parts of the community land grant process had not been followed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The lease conditions and letter of offer were prepared and stamped with Minister G McCarthy’s signature on 3 August 2012, the last working day before the caretaker period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No public information was provided during the process, causing a public information ‘blackout’.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Lawler then scrutinised the role of individuals and groups involved in this dodgy deal, starting with the Labor cabinet. He said of the cabinet:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is difficult to understand how the Cabinet ministers could have reasonably rejected the advice in the Cabinet Submission to have an open and transparent expression of interest process, and proceed to approve the proposal to grant a Crown lease exclusively to Unions NT based on one paragraph in the submission which included a warning about potential criticism in pursuing that option.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the starting point should have been a process that called for more transparency, not less, and complete adherence to the long-standing community land grant process. Unfortunately, the opposite occurred.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Minister G McCarthy’s decision was arguably unreasonable and, if challenged in a court, would be susceptible to being overturned. It was unreasonable because he did not have the necessary information to justify selectively choosing Unions NT over any other group. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">did not act with accountability, responsibility or with proper consideration of those likely to be affected by his decision, namely the numerous community groups that had expressed interest in the site over a long period of time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There was no public advertisement, no media release and no way for the public to know of his decision until a notice was published in the Government Gazette on 26 September 2012.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now return to the bill. As many of my colleagues have rightly pointed out, the construction industry provides many jobs for workers in small business, large enterprises and contractors. My dad spent many years in the construction industry and by all accounts was a highly skilled tradesman, as was his father. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This industry is critical to a productive, prosperous and internationally competitive Australia, and we on this side recognise the importance of an industry that is vital to job creation and essential to Australia's economic and social wellbeing. The bill we are debating today re-establishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a genuinely strong watchdog that will maintain the rule of law to protect workers and constructors and improve productivity on building sites and construction projects, whether onshore or offshore. If passed, the bill will reverse Labor's changes to the laws which underpinned the Australian Building and Construction Commission before it was abolished in 2012. Importantly, if passed, the bill prohibits unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing and coercion and discrimination. Penalties that are high enough to provide an effective deterrent will apply to breaches of these provisions. A wide range of effective remedies such as injunctions will also be available to the ABCC and persons affected by unlawful behaviour.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The case to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission is clear. For many years, the building and construction sector provided the worst examples of industrial relations lawlessness. Going back to 2001 when the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry found compelling evidence of the need for reform in this industry, there were many examples of how building sites and construction projects in Australia were hotbeds of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence. Projects were delayed, costs blew out and investment in our economy and infrastructure was being jeopardised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Central to the royal commission's findings was industry lawlessness. It concluded that the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the building and construction industry represented a significant departure from those in the rest of the Australian economy. Witnesses reported criminal conduct, unlawful and inappropriate conduct including breaches of the relevant workplace relations and work health and safety legislation and a disregard for Commonwealth and state revenue statutes. Inappropriate conduct was defined by the royal commission as 'behaviour that infringes the Workplace Relations Act 1996, a person's right of choice or other conduct which departs from recognised norms of civility and behaviour'. While the ABCC existed, the economic and industrial performance of the building and construction industry significantly improved. For example, a 2013 Independent Economics report on the state of the sector during this period found that building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually and, very importantly, fewer working days were lost through industrial action.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what happened: the former Labor government came under sustained pressure from building and construction unions to abolish the ABCC and the building code that supported its work. The Labor government procrastinated for five years, but the Workplace Relations Minister, who was Bill Shorten at the time, gave in to union demands and abolished the organisation in 2012 and replaced it with a regulator with significantly reduced funding and powers. This saw the bad old days return—wildcat stoppages, militant protests, demands from unions that their mates be employed on projects ahead of non-union members and an increase in construction industry disputes to a seven-year high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the case is pretty clear as to why we should restore the commission. The main objective of the bill is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building and construction work to ensure that this is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. The bill intends to improve the bargaining framework so as to further encourage genuine bargaining at the workplace level. Enterprise bargaining and negotiations must be harmonious, sensible and productive and should be tailored to the particular workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is committed to doing all that is necessary to reform the building and construction industry and to re-instate the rule of law in this sector. We on this side wholeheartedly believe that workers deserve to be able to go to work each day without the fear of being harassed, intimidated or subjected to violence. The former Labor government undermined confidence in the building and construction industry. Abolishing the ABCC has seen a return to lawlessness and an increase in the number of days where work is simply not being done in the industry. Australia cannot afford to have a building and construction industry which is inefficient and unstable. The restoration of the ABCC and the code which supports its work is critical for the reform of Australia. The contents of this bill reflect this commitment. With that, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I rise with my colleagues on this side of the House to oppose the Building Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013. It is indeed extraordinary to listen to some of the contributions of members opposite on this bill. It alerts me to the misinformation and the profound anxieties of conservative governments around the matter of organised labour movements. Clearly, organised labour is public enemy no.1, and they will do anything in order to ensure that is rendered as weak as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, of course, was rejected by the Senate in August last year, having first been introduced on 14 November 2013. And it was rejected for good reason. Labor has had a consistent position on this bill. We have opposed the proposed legislation, which forces a return to the draconian Australian Building and Construction Commission or ABCC. The ABCC is based on flawed and often ridiculed modelling and its proposed powers are extreme and unnecessary. They are undemocratic and they compromise civil liberties. Labor opposed the introduction of the ABCC in 2005 when it was first introduced. It is in our platform, and that should come as no shock to members opposite. As I stand here today, our view has not changed. The government has failed to make the case for the re-introduction of these draconian measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The foundation of this bill, as the Member for Gorton made clear, is rotten to the core. There is nothing that this anti-worker Liberal government or its $80 million political witch-hunt into the union movement has done to convince us otherwise. To be sure, the royal commission has uncovered some serious and unacceptable examples of poor behaviour. Shameful stealing from workers or obtaining unfair benefits is clearly unacceptable behaviour, and Labor has zero tolerance for such betrayals. We are in step with the government on this matter: no level of corruption is acceptable, and those found to be breaking the law should be punished accordingly. Labor has always said that we will consider sensible reforms for unions and workers, but we will not support legislation which aims to destroy strong representatives of working Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It remains the case that, whatever laws are introduced to deal with corruption, we believe they must be universal. That is a simple but fundamental principle of ensuring equality before the law and it is a principle that Labor upholds. Laws should not be unfairly targeting one set of workers. With a return to the ABCC, however, that is exactly what the Liberal government is proposing—unfairly targeting those workers in the building and construction sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I was listening to the contribution from the member for Solomon and her concerns around alleged unlawful behaviour, I was thinking of my annual attendance at a memorial service, hosted by workers from the construction industry, for their members who have died on Australian building sites. Indeed, 71 people have died on building sites in Australia in the last three years. Where is the outrage about worker safety on those sites? Where are the members opposite to say, 'We should be working with unions to ensure there is worker safety on those sites'? We all should agree that the deaths of 71 people who went to work one morning and not returning to their families are utterly unacceptable in Australia. I do not see members opposite when I attend those memorial services—</span>

                    </a>  That is a disgraceful thing to say. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms CLAYDON:</span>
                    </a>  Well, I have never seen the member for Corangamite at any of those services—correct me if I am wrong. But there is indeed an effort to be made. If you were serious about workers' safety, you would join us in bringing these concerns to the attention of the House. But, whether it is Work Choices on building sites or Work Choices on water, this government has form. It seems it is determined again to strip away the rights of workers. We stand here today because that is unacceptable, in our view. Here we are, participating in a Turnbull government accelerated debate, breaking all the usual parliamentary conventions, to go after the union movement one more time. It is the same old story from members opposite. The contrast between the two major parties is laid bare today. The Liberals have spent all their energy playing politics with their $80 million Australian taxpayer funded royal commission and they have done absolutely nothing about the horrific examples of workers being blatantly exploited at work today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week Labor announced that a Shorten Labor government will put in place a suite of reforms to protect rights at work by cracking down on unscrupulous employers who are willing to exploit workers. We will stand up for working families, for students who are working part-time and for those who are cutting back their hours as they approach retirement. Unlike this Liberal government, Labor will put people first, strengthening and protecting workers' rights at work. We will do that by cracking down on the underpayment of workers, with significantly increased penalties for employers who deliberately and systematically avoid paying their employees properly. We will be ramping up protections from sham contracting by strengthening legal protections for workers' entitlements and by increasing penalties. We will be giving the Fair Work Ombudsman more power to pursue employers who liquidate their companies in order to avoid paying the money they owe their workers. We will be introducing reforms to ensure that temporary overseas workers are not being exploited and underpaid and to ensure that there is a level playing field for workers in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, here we are, debating legislation that will have precisely the opposite effect. If this bill is enacted, it will attack the rights of working people. It is not just Labor saying this; there are other experts who agree. Nicola McGarrity and Professor George Williams from the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales have said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the ABC Commissioner's investigatory powers have the potential to severely restrict basic democratic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I thought the Liberal Party were all about free speech! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a central tenet here, and that is that we believe workers in the building and construction industry should be subject to the same laws that apply to all other workers. This is of course consistent with the principle I mentioned before around equality of all persons before the law. Why is it that Malcolm Turnbull thinks there should be different laws for construction workers than for the director of the Victorian Liberal Party? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also absolutely misleading for the government to keep referring to alleged criminal conduct to justify this bill and the introduction of the ABCC. Remember the ABCC governs civil, not criminal, behaviour. It does not matter how many times the government refers to criminal conduct in the same sentence and the necessity to revive the construction watchdog; it does not change the fact that it is a civil regulator. The creation of the ABCC in 2005 was the first time in Australian history that an industrial-specific inspectorate had been legislated. It operated in an aggressive, biased and coercive manner and did not pursue or investigate breaches such as underpayment of wages, automatically ensuring that there was no impartiality about the commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The creation of the former Australian Building and Construction Commission was based on the recommendations of yet another conservative royal commission, this time established under the Howard Liberal government: the Cole royal commission. That commission alleged that the building and construction industry was characterised by lawlessness—the same arguments we have heard again from members opposite in this debate. The minister, in his second reading speech on this bill, said the report of the royal commission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… found consistent evidence that building sites and construction projects in Australia were hotbeds of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the exact words used by the member who spoke just prior to me in this debate. While the minister is happy to repeat the royal commission's wide-sweeping statements, what the minister fails to mention is that the $60 million Cole royal commission—which consisted of some 23 volumes and which referred some 31 individuals for prosecution—in fact resulted in not a single criminal prosecution, let alone any finding of guilt. So, out of this supposed hotbed of lawlessness which was said to have been rife, there was not a single prosecution, not a single finding of guilt. How is it that the commissioner and the government can rely on an assertion that there was 'consistent evidence', yet that supposed evidence resulted in not one criminal prosecution against a union official? It would be laughable if it were not so serious. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Royal commissions are not courtrooms. The same evidentiary standards do not apply, and hearsay evidence, which is not cross-examinable, has been stated as fact. Likewise, the most recent trade union royal commission referred a number of matters for further examination by authorities—somewhere in the region of 93. If the Liberal government want to say that fewer than 150 persons being referred for further investigation arising from two royal commissions is widespread lawlessness, then we would ask: what exactly is your definition of the more than 11,000 workers who are having to have $22.3 million recovered in back pay by the Fair Work Ombudsman because dodgy employers ripped them off just in the last year alone? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is that widespread lawless conduct? Is the government seeking to introduce legislation that would increase penalties for those employers ripping off workers? No, it is not. It is only Labor that has a plan to protect the rights of Australia's working and middle-class families. Again, this just goes to show that a return to the ABCC is an ideological obsession for the Liberals. It has nothing to do with the protection of the interests of union members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another disgraceful display has been the government suggesting that it is merely reinstating the former ABCC as it was when disbanded by Labor. That is completely untrue. This legislation extends the reach of the ABCC into picketing, offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods to building sites. The minister said it himself in the second reading speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The definition of building work also includes the transporting or supplying of goods to be used in building work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is more than a revival; this is a greater encroachment upon workers than was originally the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A re-established ABCC will have significantly broader powers than its 2005 incarnation. If you drive a truck or sail a ship that has building products in or on it, if the Liberal government has its way, you had better get ready, because you could be swept off the street and forced to answer questions before the ABCC too—and you will not be able to tell your families or your boss that it happened. If the government were serious about wanting better union governance, stamping out corruption and better protecting union members, as they claim, they would be supporting the sensible proposals that Labor have put forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As was duly noted by the shadow minister for workplace relations in his contribution to this debate both in 2013 and earlier today, this bill is not about productivity, protecting workers or reducing corruption. It is about the Liberal government's determination to strip the rights of workers and reintroduce Work Choices. This is what it is all about. Work Choices is entrenched in the DNA of those opposite. They have an insatiable appetite to attack unions and diminish their capacity to represent their members, thereby slashing workers' rights and entitlements—all at taxpayers' expense. Labor has strongly opposed this bill in the past and does so again today.</span>

Regrettably, corruption, lawlessness, standover tactics, bullying and intimidation are commonplace in the Australian construction industry. But, before I speak about this bill and why it is so important, I want to address some comments made by the previous member, the member for Newcastle, and convey in no uncertain terms my disgust at the comments she made in relation to the deaths of workers on Australian construction sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is appalling that the member for Newcastle has invoked the terrible deaths of men and women who have died on Australian construction sites in her argument. In no way would anyone in this House—and I could see the faces of other members opposite, who I do not think were particularly impressed with her comments—ever suggest that full compliance with occupational health and safety and the highest standards of safety and full compliance with the law on Australian construction sites are not absolutely vital. For the member for Newcastle to use a shabby, pathetic argument discredits not only her but also her party. If she cared about bringing some integrity to this parliament, she would withdraw those comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an industry which employs more than one million Australians directly, the conduct on Australian building and construction sites has had a very deep impact on the Australian economy, the cost of doing business, the cost of construction, particularly in my home state of Victoria, and on jobs across this nation. This is not about attacking unions and about attacking workers. That is what Labor wants Australians to believe. This is about ensuring that we have a lawful and efficient workplace in the construction sector. Frankly, if employers or businesses are engaging in any inappropriate conduct, they should be held to account, because an efficient, lawful workplace is vital for workers. Workers want to work in a place where there is peace and harmony. They do not want to be subjected to standover tactics. I can tell you: the victims in most cases are the workers. We want to see a lawful environment in which the Australian construction and building industry can prosper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the ABCC was in place it resulted in fewer days lost due to industrial action. It ensured a greater degree of confidence in our very important building and construction sector. It resulted in nine per cent productivity growth in the construction industry and $7.5 billion in consumer savings. The ABCC was prepared to prosecute and punish company officials—anyone, in fact, including some union bosses—to address these issues of misconduct and unlawful behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The construction industry provides many jobs for workers and contractors in small businesses and large enterprises. It is critical to a productive, prosperous and internationally competitive Australia. The coalition government recognises the importance of an industry that is vital to job creation and essential to Australia's economic and social wellbeing. The bill re-establishes the ABCC—a genuinely strong watchdog that will maintain the rule of law. This protects workers as much as anyone else. It improves productivity, whether onshore or offshore, and it addresses many of the terrible stories that we heard in the royal commission and read in the royal commission's final report. The bill prohibits unlawful industrial action by anyone, unlawful picketing, coercion and discrimination. The penalties are high enough to provide an effective deterrent and of course to return a particular worksite to one that respects the rule of law. A wide range of effective remedies such as injunctions will also be available to the ABCC to address unlawful behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my region there have been a couple of compelling examples of this systemic behaviour on Australian construction sites, and it is clear that members opposite just want to put their head in the sand. There is a wonderful brewery in Geelong called Little Creatures—now a thriving business. The Little Creatures brewery went to hell and back to try to construct their operation. There was a violent dispute at the Little Creatures brewery, where union picketers were accused in court documents of making throat-cutting gestures and threats to stomp heads in, and workers who wanted to get on with their work were being told that they were dead. There was much shoving and kicking and punching of motor vehicles in what turned out to be an illegal picket. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The best example of a terrible time that workers went through in my region, as well as a particular company, was Boral. Boral was of course working with Grocon, and they were put in the worst possible position by the CFMEU. They were effectively and illegally black-banned by the CFMEU. The CFMEU ran a devastating campaign which according to Boral cost it more than $20 million in damages. They were working on one of the biggest projects in our region, the Regional Rail Link—such a critical project for jobs and for productivity. At the moment under the state Labor government public transport is in a fair bit of crisis, but this was and remains a very important project. According to Boral's CEO, Mike Kane, company trucks were stopped, its workers were intimidated, drivers were harassed and every possible technique was used to shut Boral down because it had contracted with Grocon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 July 2014, during the hearings of the Heydon royal commission, Boral CEO Mike Kane said that the CFMEU were using cartel tactics—blackmail, intimidation—to try and wrest control of Melbourne's multibillion dollar construction industry. He said the union and the builders were conspiring to allow anticompetitive behaviour to flourish. Mr Kane said during the hearing that CFMEU Victorian state secretary John Setka had told his staff the union was at war with Grocon, warning that Boral had to toe the line and cut its ties with Grocon or face the consequences. Mr Kane gave evidence that Boral had lost some $8 million in the preceding 19 months as long-term customers cancelled orders in order to avoid falling victim to the union's wrath. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I was roadkill. We were simply a bystander who happened to be in the way. When we didn't agree we had to be punished as a lesson to other suppliers … This type of behaviour is the essence of the criminal conspiracy we are talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Kane also pointed out that he was disappointed by the lack of action taken by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission after he complained to them about the black ban being imposed on his company. It took more than two years for the dispute to be resolved. In September 2015 the CFMEU finally settled with Boral. The CFMEU agreed to pay Boral $4 million, as well as legal costs which are expected to total some $9 million, and it agreed to submit to a range of controls to ensure it would not interfere with the company's business over the next three years. This was an unbelievably terrible time for an important company doing great work in Victoria, providing hundreds and hundreds of jobs and working on one of the biggest infrastructure projects of the time. The law was not there to help Boral. Mike Kane went through hell and back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke about this case when the legislation came before the parliament last time. The Labor Party were completely silent. They were not prepared to stand up and say enough is enough, that they would not tolerate that behaviour and would not allow that unlawful behaviour to continue on Victorian building sites. It was hurting workers and hurting jobs; it was hurting productivity and impacting on major infrastructure projects. There was deafening silence from the Labor Party, including from the Leader of the Opposition. Boral has welcomed the recommendations of the final report of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. Mike Kane has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, these reports are a comprehensive catalogue of rampant union abuses of the Australian legal system by serial recidivists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to commend Mr Kane. He has been very brave in the way in which he has spoken out. Many other businesses and employers have been too fearful to speak out, in fear of incurring the sort of wrath that Boral incurred. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">It is abundantly clear that the rule of law has been trampled on by an organisation that prides itself in taking the law into its own hands</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said that he was pleased with the way the CFMEU's conduct had been dealt with, and he acknowledged the comment that there had been 'a longstanding malignancy or disease within the CFMEU'. This is something which has been acknowledged by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who has called for the CFMEU to be deregistered. This is not about any particular union; this is not about workers. This is about conduct. If the CFMEU were prepared to comply with the law, if they were prepared to run their union in a lawful way, we would not be having this sort of discussion and these sorts of terrible findings of the royal commission would not, of course, have come to light. The government are concerned about the conduct. That is what we are concerned about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited the Epworth hospital, a very large project under construction in Geelong. I visited it a number of months ago and again last week. It is a great example of a project where there is wonderful industrial harmony. There are many members of the CFMEU working on that project, and many members to whom I have spoken are also less than impressed with the conduct of CFMEU union bosses. That is the very point—they do not like it; they do not like being caught up in this. I spoke to one, and he said, 'You're not very impressed with our union.' I said, 'No. We're all about jobs. We want to protect those jobs, but we want to make sure that you can work in a lawful workplace.' That is the key issue here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill upholds and promotes respect for the rule of law. It ensures respect for the rights of all building industry participants. It contains provisions to ensure that unlawful action, including unlawful industrial action and unlawful pickets, is dealt with appropriately. It provides effective means for investigating and enforcing the law. It certainly does much to change the lawless culture of the building and construction industry, and provides a range of higher penalties which we believe are justified to try to get the construction industry back on its feet. At the moment in Victoria, the cost of construction is running at about 30 per cent higher than in other states. We are seeing a crisis in infrastructure developments in Victoria. There is a huge loss of confidence because of the risks of doing business and embarking on these large projects in Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House. I was once a member of a union. Unions do great work. There are many wonderful members of unions right around this country, but we will not, as a government, tolerate this sort of behaviour at any work site. That is why the passing of this bill is so vitally important.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  Whether it was the 2005 introduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, whether it was the ignominious defeat of the attempt to resuscitate that, suffered in August 2015, or whether it is this particular effort to once again bring in particular measures within one industry alone in this country, there have been certain common factors. There has been the attempt to utilise purportedly legal inquiries into the building industry. Of course, there was the original one with Terence Cole, where Australian taxpayers were compelled to fork out $60 million for months of investigation. That eventually led to 31 individuals being referred for alleged misconduct but not one prosecution. This time, Dyson Heydon has sought investigation by referral of 90 individuals. In both cases, there was an attempt to imply to the Australian electorate that these particular measures are about corruption in the trade union movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, there has been exposition of very disturbing corruption, most particularly in the HSU national and New South Wales branches, the New South Wales branch of the NUW and pockets within other organisations. But this is not about those kinds of activities. This measure is about trying to accomplish the same wage repression in the building industry that the government has accomplished in other parts of the economy—whether it is the mere 2.5 per cent increase in Australian wages up to January of last year, or whether it is the figure to June last year of 2.3 per cent. In both cases, they were the lowest wage movements in this country since 1997. That is the fundamental attempt by this government to act against the building industry, where there are variety of factors, such as the Sydney construction market and the major projects of infrastructure throughout the country. The previous speaker to the debate eventually mentioned the cost of projects in Victoria. So this is about trying to ensure that wages are repressed in the building industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not as though Labor can be accused of not acting on the question of trade union corruption. Recently, a number of measures were announced as Labor policy, including: making the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, with its coercive powers, the regulator of the most serious contraventions of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act; extending the current electoral funding laws to trade union elections; the General Manager of the Fair Work Commission continuing in the role of regulator, with its current powers to conduct investigations and inquiries and resolve minor compliance issues, and receiving an additional $4.5 million for increased monitoring; and protection for whistleblowers. It is not as though Labor believes that corruption in the trade union movement, which undermines the rights of the members of those organisations, often leading to the diminution of those people's legitimate industrial conditions, should not be tackled. What is corruption in the union movement about? It is very often about a deal between employers and union leaders to, basically, sell out the workers. So we are very proactive on the question of trying to do something about trade union corruption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite half of the member for Solomon's speech concentrating—and I take her as being honest on these matters—on what looked to be a very tawdry activity in the Northern Territory, that has nothing to do with these measures. Whether the Stella Maris site in Darwin was improperly given to the trade union movement in the Northern Territory, it has nothing to do with introducing very draconian measures against rights of individual workers within trade unions which would not be tolerated by those opposite in any other sector of the Australian economy. These are the kinds of measures that, if they were occurring in Tajikistan or the Democratic Republic of the Congo—whatever sector it was occurring in—they would join other human rights campaigners, one would hope, to deplore. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not want to remind people in too lengthy a fashion, but let us remember that when they tried these measures originally the very established, respected ILO—for those who are not aware, a tripartite organisation of unions, governments and employers—was less than laudatory of this government's intervention in the building industry. In the committee on freedom of association back then, they spoke of the need to ensure that any reference to unlawful industrial action in the building and construction industry was in conformity with freedom of association principles. They said that because they were disturbed by this government's measures. The ILO further spoke of the need to ensure that the determination of the bargaining level was left to the discretion of the parties and was not imposed by law. They further commented that there was a need to introduce sufficient safeguards into the BCII Act to ensure that the functioning of the ABC commissioner and inspector did not lead to interference in the internal affairs of trade unions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government which has a track record that is condemned by the main authority in industrial relations around the world. It is the kind of authority that tries to do something about Bangladeshi garment workers' rights as buildings crash down on their heads and they are murdered, the kind of organisation with employer involvement that seeks to make sure that, in Guatemala and Honduras, trade union officials are not gunned down. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about violence in this industry and we talk about intimidation et cetera, and I heard a number of examples from the government, but I would just like to cite some of the other realities in this industry. Regarding the Lidcombe state office of the CFMEU—those dreadful people in the construction union leadership in New South Wales!—I do not see any concern that that office was firebombed at a cost of $1 million, with a petrol laden vehicle being sent in, obviously by employers who were disturbed by industrial conflict and who then fled the country. I do not see any reference to that kind of activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are asked to have some faith in this organisation to police the industry in a sensible fashion. The activities of Mr Hadgkiss over the last two years lead one to be deeply disturbed. I noticed particularly his appearance on 22 October in estimates, and I really advise people to see this just for the theatrics. The reference in his report to 1,000 crimes in the building industry sounds very disturbing. That would be deeply disturbing to anybody. He took quite a long time to understand and admit that investigation of alleged conduct is not investigation of crimes, and he further noted that they had moved towards 36 to 40 prosecutions. This is a man who has very much become part of the political campaign this involves. He has, at one point, addressed 50 stakeholder organisations in a period of eight months. When asked to indicate where those briefings had occurred, a bit like the Attorney-General of this country, he said it would be too much of a diversion of resources to provide that information. He has led an organisation which is supposedly to talk about productivity and to ensure that the building industry gets over its productivity issues. He has led an organisation which has seen a doubling of its sick leave and unscheduled absences, a culture of bullying and harassment within his own organisation and a question of pursuit of whistleblowers. He has been accused, quite correctly, of distortion of statistics by omitting references to the 2013 and 2014 figures on deaths in the building industry, which grew, in actual fact, from 17 to 28. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we are dealing with statistics, we should perhaps turn to the intervention in the last week of our friend Terence Cole. He has come up with the ludicrous figure—and I do not think many people in the government would really believe the figure—that these changes resulted in improvements of $6 billion in productivity in the industry. I want to deal with that because that came, essentially, from some figures that Econtech—Independent Economics—provided some years ago. Amongst the attacks upon those statistics, in August 2013 the Fairfax federal politics fact checker found the claim to be 'mostly false'. That is no mean description. The reports have been decried by economists for assuming union density accounts for all cost differentials across two sectors—domestic and commercial—and for ignoring other factors such as greater site complexities and higher capital intensities. Econtech has admitted to mathematical errors in their first report. Economic experts from the Queensland industrial relations department and from Griffith University have re-examined the data used in the first Econtech report and found that there was 'no evidence of cost narrowing between the two sectors'. In a perhaps more convincing analysis of the figures on which this government, through Terence Cole, relies, the Wilcox report, which inquired into the industry and also looked at Mr Cole's efforts, said of Econtech that it was deeply flawed and was to be totally disregarded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This man who had control of the inquiry which justified the first instance of this organisation—at tens of millions of dollars of cost—rushed into the debate again this week to basically try to defend this attempt to have an industry specific suppression of workers' rights. As I said earlier, Labor has acted on the question of trade union corruption in a very real fashion, not using it as a guide to try to come in and extend suppression of individual workers in the workplace. But it is also a broader question of protecting workers' rights in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has also announced a policy of cracking down on the underpayment of workers, with significantly increased penalties for employers who deliberately and systematically avoid paying new employees properly, and ramping up protections for workers from sham contracting. We have had no reference in any of these inquiries to what really bedevils the industry—sham contractors establishing companies with front people who often know nothing about the company they purportedly control, and collapsing those companies. If any problem befuddles this industry, it is this sham contracting operation. It is not only the workers who are deprived of their conditions when these companies collapse; it is also suppliers and a whole lot of building companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the guise of being concerned with trade union corruption, we have had very politicised inquiries. Coincidentally, we have seen two leaders of the main opposition party in the country called before them, with attempts being made to discredit them and use this as a political exercise. It attempts to construe the concern with corruption as a guise to clamp down on people's rights. Not only that, but they are extending this into new areas such as picketing, the transport of supplies to building sites and offshore operations. This is a government that has attempted, on a broader scale, to undermine people's conditions. They now have a situation where one million people are in this country as temporary workers. This is just another part of that pattern to try and repress wages reduce people's conditions and ensure that the kind of wage repression I cited earlier occurs. I join my opposition colleagues in opposing this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  Before I provide a contribution to this debate I want to address a contribution made by a member opposite, the member for Newcastle. Earlier this evening the member for Corangamite took issue with the member for Newcastle, and I must also. I expect that the member for Newcastle is in her suite or attending to other business at the moment, and I think she is ashamed of a particular contribution she made. She asserted that members on this side of the House, me included, have scant regard for those who lose their lives on building sites. I would ask the member for Newcastle to return to this place and make an apology for that remark to each and every member on this side of the House—in particular, me. I suffered the tragedy of having my brother sustain fatal injuries through a work accident. I think the member would do well to return and apologise for suggesting that I, having experienced that loss and having watched my parents deal with that loss, have no regard for that. And perhaps she should think better about making broad-ranging generalisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I do know something about loss, I do not know a lot about building in any practical sense. In fact, you would be quite mad to ask me to build something. I do not know a lot about the commercial building and construction industry. But someone who does know a lot about the commercial building and construction industry is Mike Kane, the Chief Executive officer of Boral. On 9 July 2014 he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On construction sites in Melbourne the law does not apply, the law is determined by the CFMEU.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is someone who knows plenty about commercial building sites, particularly in Melbourne, and he is someone we should listen to. It is exactly that that these bills address, and that is why I speak in support of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We live in a country that has enjoyed a strong tradition of adherence to the rule of law. The stability our society has delivered and our quality of life are envied across the globe by nations less fortunate than ours, and in many ways our quality of life is tied to the strength of our economy. Through strong economic performance, we have delivered greater opportunity and improved living standards. There are many industries that contribute to the wealth of this nation, and the construction industry is a critical part of that. It delivers many jobs in both small and large enterprises and is critical to a productive, prosperous and internationally competitive Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government recognises the importance of a thriving building and construction industry for renewed job creation and economic growth. Whilst it is a sector with great potential, it is also a sector which, particularly on commercial sites, has fallen into a culture of lawlessness through rampant breaches of the law by militant union action. The actions of the previous Labor government significantly weakened the regulatory body formerly known as the Australian Building and Construction Commission and have created a void in the regulation of the building and construction industry today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation I stand to support seeks to reinstate the ABCC and, in so doing, establish the regulatory framework the industry is so badly in need of. There is undeniably a culture of lawlessness gripping the construction industry in this nation. Its cancerous growth was expedited by the Labor government's decision in 2012 to abolish the ABCC. This culture of lawlessness has filled the void left by the previous government and is undermining not only our economy, our communities and our growth but also our nation as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Royal Commissioner Dyson Heydon—one of our nation's most respected jurists and a man who was subjected to a shameful, dishonest campaign in an effort to deride the good work of the commission—has brought to light the extent to which the culture of lawlessness has gripped our building and construction industry. We should talk in more detail about an objectionable character who leads the CFMEU—or did. In 2013 John Setka, a union chief of the CFMEU, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our union has given us a mandate, They want us to remain a militant union.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He was, of course, reflecting on a court decision from the same year—and it is neither the first nor the last time a union has been found guilty of contempt. This is the kind of attitude and unrepentant contempt for the law and judicial process that pervades the leadership of the CFMEU—leadership that has seized on the free-for-all delivered to them by the former Labor government in abolishing the ABCC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, if you harbour any doubts as to the seriousness of this culture of lawlessness, you need look no further than the endorsement given to Mr Setka by notorious underworld crime figure Mick Gatto, who described Mr Setka as 'a close mate' and has previously stated that he would make a good prime minister. My goodness. The CFMEU has members of outlawed bikie gangs who march with them in rallies and, effectively, operate as their 'thump merchants'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the royal commission, a principal contractor testified that a Labor powerbroker, Ken Hardy, secretary of the ALP's Melton branch, suggested the contractor pay $50,000 to Mr Gatto to fix his problem with the CFMEU—extortion by any other name. And who could forget the remarkable evidence taken at the commission about seven tonnes of documents that were destroyed. These were documents that were subpoenaed, to be delivered to the commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an exchange that was heard by the commission because it was recorded, you can see the depth of this lawless behaviour. This is at a point where there have been court orders for production of these documents. Mr Hanna was involved with the CFMEU. The exchange is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Hanna: No you can't. But um got all that done, there was f***ing mountains and mountains of ... (indistinct) ... seven tonnes' worth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Skourdoumbis: Really?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mr Hanna: Yep, it was weighed, the truck was weighed when it got dumped that's how much f***ing paper, paper is heavy. Paper is heavy. It all got taken down to my f****ing joint where he stores his f****ing car trailer and he stores his caravan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you need any further evidence of this culture of lawlessness, there it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 June the Federal Court fined the CFMEU and five of its officials some $545,000 for unlawful conduct, saying that their conduct was a 'deliberate stratagem'. What an absolute waste of hard-earned members' money. The court noted that the officials displayed no contrition and no remorse—unsurprising, given the sorts of characters associated with this militant union. It is a story that has played out time and time again, in the courts, as union officials show little regard for the rule of law. The list goes on and on, at every level the CFMEU, and epitomises the culture of  lawlessness that is gripping our nation's construction industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government refuses to accept such behaviour and is taking action to eliminate such a damaging culture. This bill re-establishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a genuinely strong watchdog that will maintain the rule of law to protect workers and improve productivity in the process on building sites and construction projects, both on-shore and off-shore. There is an economic imperative to reinstate the ABCC. Workplaces across each and every territory of this nation are seeing honest, hardworking people being intimidated and extorted by militant union officials. Such a culture dislocates enterprise and innovation and directly affects the economic performance of our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the ABCC existed, the economic and industrial performance of the building and construction industry significantly improved. For example, a 2013 Independent Economics report on the state of the sector found that since the implementation of the ABCC: building and construction industry productivity grew by nine per cent; consumers were better off to the tune of some $7.5 billion, annually, and that is the cost of taking the ABCC away; and fewer working days were lost through industrial action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite seriously believed in better economic outcomes for this nation they would be wise to support this legislation. This legislation is a test for those opposite in the ALP and their coalition partners, the Australian Greens, to see if are willing to make the right decision—notwithstanding pressure from their union masters. If those opposite are serious about providing an alternative government they will, surely, put the national interest before their union paymasters. It is evident they lack the capacity and intestinal fortitude to stand up to the union movement. That is to the detriment of thousands of small- to medium-sized businesses suffering the effects of this intimidation—not to mention workers who are at the frontline of this union brutality and intimidation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only do those opposite do the national economy a disservice but also they are supporting the toxic and xenophobic culture that exists within the CFMEU. I reference the xenophobic campaign waged across this nation—including in my electorate of Barker—to undermine the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. That behaviour was gobsmackingly xenophobic. There was no objection to the free trade agreement with Japan or Korea, but there was a campaign run to end this one. Farmers in my electorate were grateful and breathed a sigh of relief when that bilateral agreement was executed in December last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The union movement and the CFMEU, in particular, has some form when it comes to racist behaviour. It pervades the culture of that militant union. You need only see the actions of Mr Setka, someone I have mentioned previously. He allegedly referred to a subcontractor who was performing painting work as an 'effing dog Turkish effing painting piece of shit'. If the leaders of this union display such racist behaviour what hope can we hold for the rest of the organisation who—</span>

                    </a>  Sure. If the leaders of the union display racist behaviour, what hope do we hold for the rest of the organisation, who we know have to adhere to the closed shop mentality, which is the basis of union ideology? Such a culture of xenophobia has been facilitated by the lack of regulation in the construction space and its impact is another example of the culture of lawlessness that has pervaded our building and construction industry. Not only is this culture of lawlessness damaging to our economy and our social harmony but also it directly undermines our egalitarian Australian values—things that all in this place should strive to protect.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers adequate protections for employers and employees alike. It delivers stronger penalties to employers who operate unlawfully. And so it should. The reality is that only the coalition has the capacity to deliver the rule of law back into building sites. We have established it before and we will achieve it again. When it comes to delivering rule of law to the industry, there could not be a more stark difference between the coalition and the Labor Party. You only have to look to the track record of the Labor Party's association with the militant CFMEU. Why do they stand by the CFMEU despite everything I have said and others have contributed, and the findings and evidence taken by Dyson Heydon? Well, it will not surprise you to learn that since 2007 the ALP has accepted over $7 billion in donations from the CFMEU, $750,000 over the year ending 30 June 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There it is; there's the rub: they want to run away from the CFMEU at a million miles an hour. Indeed, Labor luminaries, former members of this place, have suggested that they should do that very thing. But of course they cannot, because they are tied financially. And it is a significant connection, one that they ought to sever, in their own interests and in the interests of this nation, but one that they cannot—or at least they fail to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to oppose that culture of lawlessness I have spoken about. The status quo is not sufficient. We have the solution for this problem. It is a solution that is before this House. I encourage those in the other place to support it, particularly the crossbench. It is said that, for evil to thrive, all that must occur is for good people to do nothing. This government will not abide such a culture, and we are taking steps in this bill to eradicate it. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I rise in opposition to the legislation before the House, the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2] and related legislation. I think the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Barker, really sums up the debate, such as it is. There is only one element of his contribution with which I agree, and that is when he highlights the contrast between the positions of the major parties on this. He is right to do so, and that is the only respect in which his contribution has any correctness to it. He talks about the national interest. Well, that is something that Labor is concerned with. When it comes to workplace relations, it is the Labor Party that is concerned with the interests of Australians, particularly those Australians—the majority of Australians—who work for a living. Labor's agenda when it comes to the workplace is about putting people first, looking at the issues that governments should be concerned about in the workplace, particularly the growing and disturbing evidence of exploitation arising from insecure workplace arrangements and exploitative employment arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Labor has put forward a plan to strengthen and protect workers' rights at work through cracking down on illegal underpayment, with increased penalties for employers who systematically avoid paying their employees properly, and dealing with the issue of sham contracts—an issue that was identified way back in the Cole commission, which this government seems unconcerned about—and giving more power to the appropriate authorities to investigate these issues of underpayment while ensuring that temporary overseas workers are protected, not exploited. That is one agenda to deal with a real problem facing working Australians today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, all we have from government members in support of this stale legislation is rhetoric—rhetoric based in ideology. But it is more offensive than that, because, as we saw at the start of the contribution by the member for Barker, he took grave exception to the contribution by my colleague and friend the member for Newcastle—grave exception. Now, I was not there for that contribution, but I find it extraordinary that someone who could take that point at the beginning of his contribution to this debate could then base his argument for the introduction of this extraordinary suite of coercive powers—this extraordinary attack on fundamental rights and liberties—on such outrageous allegations, including those that really stretched the boundary of appropriate use of this parliament. They were just extraordinary allegations that were levelled, in place of evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I guess that is the nub of this debate. This piece of legislation is a triumph of ideology over evidence. So, today we see the reality of our new Prime Minister's new politics. It is writ very small, because it comes back to the ideology, the antiworker and anti-union ideology, that is writ into the DNA of members opposite. So we have the legislation before us—the reintroduction of flawed legislation, those flaws in fact being exacerbated with the passage of time. This legislation speaks volumes as to the paucity—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr GILES:</span>
                    </a>  The paucity of vision that this government has for the future of our workplaces and indeed the future of Australia: we see it again, and it has been demonstrated already since I have been in this chamber, the government's reflexive preference for ideology over evidence. This does not equal an exciting time to be Australian. In particular, it does not equal an exciting time to be an Australian worker. We have before us a set of laws which, if enacted, would be undemocratic, discriminatory and deeply dishonest—an assault on fundamental rights for workers by reason of one thing: the industry in which they work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is very disappointing to go through this debate again, but even more disappointing to see how little this debate has advanced across the chamber, on the government side of the chamber, over the past two years. Since I last had the opportunity to participate in a debate about a very similar series of laws, in December 2013, we have learnt quite a lot about inequality and its consequences for our economy as well as for individuals and their families. We have also learnt that good workplace laws, fair workplace laws and, in particular, the role of unionism and collective bargaining are a critical bulwark to resisting inequality that can be a significant barrier to growth. We have also seen further evidence that the labour share of gross domestic product is trending down, while labour productivity is trending up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the problem that this legislation is intended to solve? What problem have we been presented that this legislation is trying to solve? That is a question in respect of which this government has no answer. Some of the points made in 2013 by Labor members bear repeating, and perhaps government members might listen on this occasion. I think there are some principles here that we can clearly state which I would like to hear government members respond to, and they are: we should have one set of laws for workplaces for all workers, regardless of the industries in which they work. We should have—and this is something that the new Prime Minister has spoken much about but done very little about—evidence based, evidence-led policy across his responsibilities, including when it comes to the world of work. We should have, further to this, a real debate about productivity and how our workplace in the future can function more effectively—a real debate, not one built on ideology, assertion and the sort of intemperate allegations that characterise the contribution of the member for Barker. We should think very, very hard—and I say this to members of the Liberal Party—about attacking fundamental civil liberties through legislation that erodes them. This should ever only take place on the basis of a compelling body of evidence, and none such has been put before the parliament in this regard. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to touch on a couple of the elements of the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2] in particular. The bill<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s title speaks of 'improving productivity' but it does not take us much further than that, if at all. It is just a fig leaf and an unconvincing fig leaf at that. As I said two years ago, the legislation mentions productivity in its body just twice, neither with particular import nor any likely effect. This is just window-dressing at best. The arguments that were advanced back then and, indeed, today place enormous reliance on a 2007 report by the modelling firm Econtech, and this purported to tell a powerful story of productivity growth driven by the introduction of the then ABCC. But it has turned out that this was based on incorrect data—something which has been subsequently admitted by Econtech but not conceded by government members or, indeed, the minister. What data there is available tells a different story—one that is entirely consistent with government claims, although of course Labor members recognise that productivity growth depends on many, many factors. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This allegation is entirely unsupported by evidence. I would simply say: he would say this, wouldn't he? What is clear when we look at productivity across workplaces generally but also when it comes to the building and construction industry is that Labor<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s approach is the best way: cooperation and fairness in place of suspicion and unnecessary conflict with this approach of treating workers as criminals. I note also in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> this week a contribution by His Honour Justice Cole, who was the commissioner of the last royal commission into the building and construction industry in Australia. He said something which again should challenge members of this government who profess an attachment to a small government view of the world. He said—and perhaps this comes to the nub of the debate and the onus government members have failed to even seek to discharge:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Surely it is incumbent upon those who oppose the reintroduction of the ABCC to explain how it is to the advantage of the Australian economy, and to the Australian people who bear the great costs of unlawful action, to have an increased level of unlawfulness in the building and construction industry which the ABCC has demonstrated it can suppress, but which existing arrangements do not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trouble with this quote is all of it. No evidence has been presented, I submit, because none exists. The allegations that follow are simply bare assertions, unsupported by evidence, supported only by reflexive ideology from a government that is obsessed with undermining and attacking unions, a government that has recently—it is interesting to see—focused on the fact that our wage growth is at a record low and the new Treasurer talks about his concern for the budget based on this. What a journey government members are coming on from the point at which the former employment minister, Senator Abetz, talked about the wages explosion that the Productivity Commission inquiry into our workplace laws was supposed to address. Again, across this journey, it shows one thing: whatever the evidence, government members will be motivated only by ideology and anti-worker, anti-collectivist ideology. We see this in the trade union royal commission—an inquiry into nothing more than an $880 million political witch<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">-</span>hunt. That commission and this bill show what the government is missing in respect of the real debate, which is that we should be engaged in the future of work. This is a critical failing. The Prime Minister has demonstrated this, because he is happy to editorialise on and give gratuitous advice to the trade union movement and the Labor Party, but he has nothing to say when it comes to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission—those recommendations about penalty rates, in particular—because I think he understands that Australians reject his vision for workplaces. Australians seek fairness but they also seek leadership. They seek more than sophistry and rhetoric from their political leaders. This is just simply not good enough from the government that he leads at a time when, as Labor has recognised, we are seeing too many workers being exploited at work, with too little recourse whether by way of the legislative framework or by way of those enforcement bodies that are available to support any legislative framework that exists. We see the rise in insecure work and, with it, insecure lives, damaging Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to what is perhaps the central failing of this bill, which is its recourse to an extraordinary suite of coercive powers. This legislation, if adopted, would provide for a new set of laws for and, indeed, only for those associated with the building and construction industry. These do go beyond the previous powers afforded to the Australian Building and Construction Commission in terms of their scope, in terms of the scope of the industry that is applicable to, in terms of them being retrospective, making unlawful today what was previously lawful. These are simply extreme, unnecessary, unjustified and indeed unjustifiable powers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see before us a wide-ranging attack on workers' right in breach of human rights and of our international obligations, demonising a class of Australians for one reason and one reason only—the industry in which they work. I ask members opposite to think about the harm done and the message sent by a regime of secret interviews with the threat of imprisonment hanging over them. I ask members opposite to think about the views expressed by Professor Andrew Stewart at the time the previous legislation was introduced. Professor Stewart is one of Australia's leading experts on industrial law. He said that the powers proposed to be increased under this bill were 'extraordinary, analogous to those of ASIO'. He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ordinarily, under our laws, you have certain rights not to answer questions … You have privileges against self-incrimination. But these rights do not exist when you are being interviewed by the ABCC. That an innocent member of the public can get caught up in these powers simply increases the concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other academics compared the similarities to terrorism laws. I was troubled two years ago, and I continue to be deeply troubled by this and many other aspects of this suite of coercive powers: the reverse onus provisions and the curtailing of the presumption of innocence the right to peaceful assembly, the right to freedom of speech and the privilege against self-incrimination and freedom of expression—an attack on the right of people to organise collectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In looking at these powers, I urge members opposite to think about this intrusion on civil liberties and to think about the 'first principles' question that is before us. What is the problem we are trying to solve? It is clear it is not about productivity and it is not about getting the balance of power right in our workplaces. Let's be clear: the legislation before us is an attack on workers in the building and construction industry, an attack on unionism and an attack on our social fabric. These are bad laws that should be rejected by this parliament again.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  The construction industry provides many jobs throughout Australia for workers in small and large business, especially contractors. In the electorate of Forrest the 2011 census recorded that 8,770 people were employed in the construction industry, more than in any other industry in the region. It is critical to the growth and development of the electorate of Forrest, as it is to the entire nation. In fierce competition with the maritime industry, it is also one of the industries that has seen the worst of union behaviour across the nation, especially historically in Western Australia. The bad and often illegal behaviour has been an enormous cost to the nation and an embarrassment to the good and honest workers who were betrayed by the political manoeuvrings, power plays and greed of the union leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this kind of behaviour that resulted in the establishment of the Cole royal commission into the building and construction industry in 2001. And it is worth recalling why the ABCC was set up in the first place. The final report of the Cole commission provided more than enough compelling evidence of the need for reform in the building industry at the time, and there is more than ample evidence today that, when you relax the rules to pander to union bosses, things will quickly revert to the same dire state. In 2001 the commission found consistent evidence that building sites and construction projects in Australia were places of intimidation, lawlessness, thuggery and violence that caused delays to projects and major cost blow-outs. There were then, as remains under the regime brought in by Labor, significant threats to investment in our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report of the Cole royal commission identified 392 separate instances of unlawful conduct, 25 different types of unlawfulness and 90 different types of inappropriate behaviour. That is why the ABCC was set up in the first place. This included unlawful strikes; unlawful payments; abuse of union rights of entry; fabrication of safety issues; compulsory unionism; coercion to pay wages and meet conditions demanded by unions; disregard of contracts and agreements; disregard of court and tribunal orders; workplace rorts; threats and intimidation; inadequate attention to health and safety; and interference in commercial tendering for industrial purposes. Unfortunately, it all sounds too familiar. Based on those findings, the Cole royal commission made 212 recommendations for substantial regulatory reform, both structural and cultural—and 12 of the 31 individuals who had breached criminal laws actually came from Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission also mentioned a union training levy, which was a payment made by union members under the enterprise bargaining agreement. The commission was also concerned by the funding of the 'Construction Skills Training Centre Inc', the training company of which Kevin Reynolds was the chairman. That union, which has since become the Construction, Mining, Forestry and Energy Union, or CMFEU, lent millions of dollars to the company that was in fact the 'union leadership trust fund'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the very reasons why the original ABCC was established, and it is why the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2], before the House again today, is so important. This bill re-establishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a genuinely strong watchdog that will maintain the rule of law to protect workers and constructors and improve productivity on building sites and construction projects whether they be onshore or offshore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will reverse Labor's changes to the laws which underpinned the Australian Building and Construction Commission before it was abolished by the Labor government in 2012. It will attempt to shut the gate to building union corruption, which was opened wide by the Labor government under pressure from union bosses when they abolished the ABCC. The evidence and findings of the recent royal commission into trade union governance and corruption clearly define why this legislation is necessary once again. The bill will once again prohibit unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing and coercion and discrimination, providing penalties that are high enough to provide an effective deterrent to breaches of these provisions and a wide range of effective remedies, such as injunctions, which will also be available to the ABCC and persons affected by unlawful behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005 provided what was a genuinely strong watchdog, and it did deal with those issues that we saw at the time. It was a strong, specialist regulator enforcing the rule of law applying to the building and construction sector. The economic and industrial performance of the building and construction industry improved when the ABCC existed. A 2013 Independent Economics report on the state of the sector during this period found that building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually and fewer working days were lost through industrial action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, and probably naturally, as soon as Labor came to government in 2007 there was immediate and sustained pressure from building and construction unions to abolish the ABCC. In 2012, the then workplace relations minister, Bill Shorten, gave in to those demands and abolished the organisation and replaced it with a regulator with significantly reduced funding and powers. This unfortunately emboldened him and, with Minister Shorten firmly under control, construction union heavyweights got back to the murky business of thuggery that the ABCC had denied them for seven years. This included violence on the streets in the City of Melbourne, with militant union protestors intimidating the community and their supporters attacking police horses. We also saw the unprecedented action of workers on the site purchasing an advertisement in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> with an open letter to their own union bosses asking for the blockades to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The then Rudd Labor government was well aware of this type of behaviour in the building and construction industry and was understandably quite reluctant to abolish the ABCC despite strong union pressure. It contracted Justice Murray Wilcox to review the industry to buy time. Justice Wilcox recognised the need for and the benefit provided by the ABCC, stating in his report that 'the ABCC's work is not yet done' and 'it would be unfortunate' if the ABCC's replacement body 'led to a reversal of the progress that has been made'. But that is exactly what we saw happen. The Labor government set up a severely curtailed version of the ABCC called the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate. The coalition committed to the re-establishment of the ABCC during and before the election campaign. It is one more promise that we are fulfilling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to ensuring that the rule of law is maintained and that workers in the building and construction sector can go to work free of intimidation and harassment. The ABCC legislation deals with unlawful acts of both unions and business. The new Building Code in this legislation will ensure taxpayer funded projects are run efficiently and lawfully. Should an employer be found guilty of underpaying workers, guilty of safety breaches or misusing migration laws or visa violations, that employer will not be allowed to do Commonwealth funded work. The coalition also promised that a re-established Australian Building and Construction Commission will administer a code that will govern industrial relations arrangements for government funded projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill aims to improve the bargaining framework so as to further encourage genuine bargaining at the workplace level. It contains provisions to ensure that unlawful action, including unlawful industrial action and unlawful pickets, are dealt with appropriately. It includes the ability for the courts to impose significant penalties for individuals and organisations that participate in unlawful action. The Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will be able to exercise power to obtain information quickly and effectively without being hindered by unnecessary bureaucratic red tape around the issue of examination notices. However, to ensure accountability and transparency, the use of these powers will continue to be reviewed and reported on by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Importantly, this bill encourages productivity and the pursuit of high levels of employment in the building and construction industry. It will help to create jobs and investment by ensuring that employers and workers in the industry can get on with the jobs that they go to work to do. That is mostly what they want to do: just get on with the job that they are employed to do and get on with the job that they have been paid to do without fear of intimidation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the future under this legislation the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner will be able to compel witnesses to attend an examination or to produce documents where he or she reasonably believes that the person has information or documents relevant to an investigation into a suspected contravention of workplace relations laws. These powers are needed to ensure the ABCC is able to carry out its investigations effectively and is a key tool for breaking down the historical and unacceptable culture of silence in the sector. There are appropriate and effective safeguards in this bill to ensure due process and transparency in the use of these powers. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  I rise to oppose the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No.2] and cognate bill. Like many of my colleagues, I do so for the second time. In 2013, I spoke against this bill and I proudly do so again tonight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have claimed that this legislation is about eliminating union corruption. I want to make it clear from the very outset that Labor has zero tolerance for corruption. We have made that clear time and time and time again. Labor has always said that we will consider sensible reforms for unions and workers, but we will not support legislation that aims to destroy strong representation of working Australians. But this legislation really has nothing to do with corruption. This is about the reintroduction of the draconian ABCC, with its extreme, unnecessary, undemocratic powers that compromise civil liberties. This is about furthering the government's antiworker and antiunion agenda.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in this place, I said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">History shows us that if work is to be dignified workers need advocates, because workers rights did not fall from the sky. History shows that, without unions, workers were broken in what William Blake called dark satanic mills. He understood that change would not come without a fight, and the best weapon in the fight for workers rights is the trade union. This is why I am proud that the Labor Party was born in the fires of the union movement and fashioned on its anvils. It is something we should never seek to hide and something we should be proud of. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I left high school, unions have protected me at work. They have been part of my life. They have also protected friends of mine who have been exploited. They are crucial particularly when you are young, in your late teens and early 20s, and you are trying to work your way through the world and the workforce. I have had a number of friends who have been sacked from jobs without any reason and at very short notice. Then they have gone to speak to their union and they have been compensated appropriately for being sacked without any reason or notice. So I have had friends who have benefited from the hard work of unions, unions fighting for their rights at work, and they have protected me on many occasions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been a union member since I left high school, I was also a union official, a workplace representative for the MEAA, which used to be the AJA. I have been a member of the MEAA since I started my career here in Canberra in 1990. I am a proud member of the MEAA and I was proud to be a workplace delegate. I was involved in the negotiation of the very first enterprise bargaining agreement of any government agency in the Public Service. That was way back in 1997, from memory, just after the Howard government got in. I was proud to work with my union to get the best result for the members of that union and the MEAA members at my workplace. At that stage, when we were defining the 'no disadvantage' rule, we were particularly at pains to ensure that no-one was going to be disadvantaged as a result of the changes that would come about through the EBA. As I said, since I left high school unions have protected me and friends of mine at work. They have protected friends of mine who were sacked for no reason at very short notice, and they have also been part of my life as a proud workplace delegate for the MEAA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians will have enjoyed some well-deserved annual leave over December and January. Perhaps they had Christmas with their family, celebrated the new year with friends or took some much needed R&amp;R in January. Let me tell you: that leave was not afforded to us by the good graces of our employers. No—it was fought for and won by unions, by thousands and thousands of workers over the years fighting for workers' rights. Annual leave did not fall from the sky. It was not gifted very gently one year by a very generous employer. It was a hard-fought-for right that all Australians enjoy every year, thanks to unions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just annual leave that is the result of hard work by thousands of workers since the union movement was established here in the late 1800s; it is other workplace entitlements that many of us take for granted today. One of those is the eight-hour day. Many people do not actually work an eight-hour day—it has been reduced in some places—but, essentially, the whole principle of the eight-hour day was the result of a hard-won fight by unions. One of my favourite statues is the beautiful orb over the road from Trades Hall in Melbourne, that grim old Victorian bluestone building, sitting there as solid as a rock, next to the jail and just behind the oldest workers' college in the world, my former alma mater. I was union president of RMIT—it is the oldest workers' college in the world. There is that beautiful orb, sitting there very quietly near what used to be the Emily McPherson building and diagonally opposite Trades Hall. No-one really notices it anymore—the orb of the eight-hour day, celebrating that victory that took so long to achieve. It took unions and workers years and years to achieve it: eight hours work, eight hours sleep and eight hours rest. It was an amazing achievement, and it did not fall from the sky. It was not generously gifted by an employer. It was something that came about thanks to unions and thousands of workers who fought hard for it over the years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, so many of us take these entitlements and conditions—safe workplaces and so much else—for granted. But these conditions are the creation of unions, and I thank unions for that. However, we have to be forever vigilant, because these rights can be taken away from us very quickly. That is why those who would take any opportunity to wind back these hard-fought-for entitlements will be fought from this side of the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the construction industry there is no entitlement more important than a worker's safety and the right of a worker to express concerns about their safety without fear of recrimination. We know that there are still too many deaths, injuries and near misses in the construction industry. Here in Canberra we have been reminded of that fact all too often in recent years, with the deaths of Wayne Vickery, Michael Booth and Ben Catanzariti. We need unions to ensure the safety of workers in the construction industry, but this proposed legislation seeks to limit the ability of unions to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking about this legislation, my colleague the member for Wakefield told the story of Ark Tribe, who in 2008 was summoned by the former ABCC to determine the legality of his actions. What had he done?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was the supposedly unauthorised action that the ABCC wanted to investigate? It was attending a work safety meeting. He had merely attended a work safety meeting. I have heard several speakers on the opposite side say that this legislation has nothing to do with safety in the construction industry, but Art's case proves them wrong. If a construction worker can be summoned for attending a meeting to express concerns about the safety of a work site and if they can be threatened with six months' imprisonment for not complying with this summons, then safety is going to be affected—there is no doubt about it. People will be simply too scared to attend such meetings to raise their safety concerns. And the price will be paid. The price will be paid in lives and in livelihoods lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will re-establish the ABCC and provide it with coercive powers that will compel ordinary workers to be subject to secret interviews, denied legal representation and threatened with imprisonment if the person subject to such coercive powers refuses to cooperate. For workers in one industry only, this legislation removes the right to silence, the right to legal representation, the right against self-incrimination and the right to tell someone you have been interrogated against your will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These powers are excessive, they are undemocratic and they are unwarranted. As many of my colleagues have pointed out, they are Orwellian, and they are not what Australians expect of our government in a democratic, 21st-century Australia. But don't just take my word for it. Nicola McGarrity and Professor George Williams from the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales say: 'The ABC Commissioner's investigatory powers have the potential to severely restrict basic democratic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we are debating today actually seeks to go one step further than the previous incarnation of the ABCC. This bill extends the reach of the ABCC into picketing, offshore construction and the transport and supply of goods to building sites. The bill will extend the ABCC's jurisdiction offshore to as far as Australia's exclusive economic zone or waters above the continental shelf. It will encompass the transport or supply of goods to building sites, including resource platforms.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this issue, the contrasts between the two major parties could not be more clear. They are stark. While those opposite are seeking to strip the basic rights of workers, this week Labor announced that a Shorten Labor government will put in place a suite of reforms to protect rights at work by cracking down on unscrupulous employers who are willing to exploit workers, because we will stand up for middle- and working-class families. We have a proud tradition of standing up for working- and middle-class families, and we will continue to fight for their rights. Labor will put people first. We will strengthen and protect workers' rights at work, by: cracking down on the underpayment of workers, with significantly increased penalties for employers who deliberately and systematically avoid paying their employees properly; ramping up protections for workers from sham contracting; giving the Fair Work Ombudsman more power to pursue employers who liquidate their companies in order to avoid paying the money they owe their workers, which is just a completely appalling act; and introducing reforms to ensure that temporary overseas workers are not being exploited and underpaid and that there is a level playing field for all workers in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also has a plan for better unions, and if the government were actually serious about wanting better union governance, stamping out corruption and protecting union members then they would support our sensible proposals. Labor's package of reforms will help ensure that criminal conduct is detected at the earliest opportunity and dealt with by the full force of the law. Central to our plan is making ASIC, with its coercive powers, the regulator of the most serious contraventions of the registered organisations act. The general manager of the Fair Work Commission will continue its role as a regulator, with its current powers to conduct investigations and inquiries and resolve minor compliance issues, and it will receive an additional $4.5 million for increased monitoring of registered organisations. We will also extend current electoral funding laws to donations and expenditure relating to all elections managed by the AEC, such as those for union elections. In line with our longstanding commitment to greater transparency, we will also reduce the disclosure threshold for political donations from $13,000 to $1,000. We will also protect and encourage whistleblowers by extending protections. We will double the maximum penalties for all criminal offences under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, and also a court will be able to disqualify an official for serious contraventions. These are just some of the measures that we have announced over the last week or so to improve unions and to provide greater transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's justification for singling out one industry, as it is doing with this proposed legislation, is flimsy at best. I am pleased to oppose this bill for the second time. This bill is not about eliminating corruption. It is not about improving productivity. It is not about creating safer workplaces. It is not about preventing illegal industrial action. It is about the coalition's anti-union agenda. It is about demonising the construction industry, demonising unions and demonising their members.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People in this country are fed up with the lawlessness of the unions and the bullying standover tactics that plague the construction sites across Australia. They are fed up with the intimidation, thuggery and violence that are commonplace on these sites. This is not a case of a few bad apples. It is commonplace behaviour for the construction unions across the country. Again, having worked in the construction industry, starting as an apprentice years ago, I can understand it. I have seen evidence of it and I know how it works. Those on the other side of the chamber know how it works, as well, and they are protecting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had this behaviour documented in countless reports by royal commissions, including the most recent royal commission into trade union governance. At least 26 people have been referred to public prosecutors, and another 86 as a result of the most recent royal commission. These are the figures from August, so that reality could be even worse. There can be no denying what is going on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said in parliament before on this topic, I would like to declare my life experiences with the unions. I guess I can go back to a particular time where, as an employee working for a national company that manufactured, designed and built equipment in Australia, we had a situation with a product that had been produced. United Technologies was in the process of trying to take one of the products over to Thailand to have their subsidiary, Carrier air conditioning, look at it and copy it. At that particular time I rang my uncle, who was on the docks in Melbourne, and asked, 'Listen, mate, is there any chance you can get this piece of equipment dropped off the wharf?' He said, 'Well, I'll do better than that. I'll get one of my Labor politician mates to ring you and see if we can sort something out.' Fifteen minutes later Kim Beazley Jr was on the phone to my office—and this is well before I had anything to do with politics. Kim said, 'I will put you in touch with someone who will be able to help you out.' Fifteen minutes later John Halfpenny rang me. In that process John was quite supportive of Australian industry. I think he had a great idea about Australian industry and unions working together, but at the same time he related that the union he was with had no concern for negotiation. He said, 'We just want to be confronting. We just want to attack, attack, and we will worry about negotiation at the end of the day.' But John did the job: he coerced United Technologies in the US, under the threat of having the Australian government cancel the Sikorsky helicopter contract, into saying that they would not copy the Australian product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another experience for me with unions was as an apprentice onsite in Bayswater, Victoria. You will not believe it, but a redheaded Scottish shop steward came up to me on the site and demanded to see my ticket. I said that I did not have one, and after a five-minute discussion he decided he was going to shut the site down. I gave him 20 metres to walk away and then explained to him that I was an apprentice. At that particular time apprentices were not required to be members of unions. He was very disappointed that he had missed an opportunity shut the site down and harm the employer's business and the work being carried out on this construction site. Working on construction sites, I have seen for years and years how this works. Again, I say that those on the other side of the House condone it, and they are still protecting it with the arguments they are presenting today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Costigan royal commission's investigation soon revealed that many members of the union were involved in a wide range of criminal activities:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Union has attracted to its ranks in large numbers men who have been convicted of, and who continue to commit, serious crimes. … Violence is the means by which they control the members of their group. They do not hesitate to kill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Included in the crimes of union members were:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… taxation fraud, social security fraud, ghosting, compensation fraud, theft on a grand scale, extortion, the handling of massive importations of drugs, the shipments of armaments, all manner of violence and murder.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the union's members being 'careless of their reputation, glorying in its infamy' that very reputation attracted 'employment by wealthy people outside their ranks who stoop to use their criminal prowess to achieve their own questionable ends'. It sounds very similar to how they CFMEU operates today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The unions continue to operate as lawless thugs on construction sites, because they are allowed to by this parliament. There is no strong regulator of workplace laws for the building industry that holds the unions to account any more. This was abolished by the Gillard government. Ever since then the coalition has attempted to bring back the regulator, the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It was in 2012 that the Gillard government folded to union pressure and abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We know that Labor had been under sustained pressure from building and construction unions for at least five years, and it was then that the workplace relations minister, Bill Shorten, gave into union demands and abolished the ABCC, which had been established by the Howard government. Australians are familiar with the disastrous and tragic consequences of many of the decisions of the Rudd/Gillard governments, including over 1,000 deaths at sea from loosening border controls, which comes to mind as one of the most dreadful and regrettable decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have been the consequences of Labor's decision to abolish the ABCC? What has happened since then? We know a lot has happened. The bad old days of industrial militancy have returned, with wildcat stoppages, militant protests, demands from unions that their mates be employed on projects, ahead of non-unionists, and an increase in construction industry disputes to a seven-year high. Weeks after the Australian Building and Construction Commission was abolished we saw violent scenes on the streets of the city of Melbourne, with militant union protestors intimidating the community and their supporters attacking police horses. Why would they attack police horses? It is just beyond me. We had workers on the site purchasing an advertisement in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span>, with an open letter to their own union bosses that asked for the blockades to stop. Images of these protests were seen on television screens around the world. What message did this send to national and international companies about investing in building and construction projects in Melbourne or in Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another incident saw the CFMEU grossly bullying non-members by creating posters labelling them—amongst various other things—as 'scabs' and advocating that they be run out of the industry, in open defiance of the Fair Work Act and Supreme Court orders to end the protests. There was a violent dispute at the Little Creatures brewery site in Geelong where union picketers were accused in court documents of making throat-cutting gestures and threats to stomp heads in; workers who wanted to get on with their work were being told they were dead; and there was shoving, kicking and punching of motor vehicles. Disturbingly, we saw union protestors threatening people with 'Colombian neckties' at City West Water in Werribee, where the dispute was so heated that workers had to be flown in by helicopter. The term 'Colombian neckties' came from the Colombian Civil War of 1948 and involves slashing a victim's throat horizontally and pulling their tongue out through the open wound. It sounds sick, but we have people in Australia making those sorts of threats to other Australians—very unAustralian as far as I am concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a bizarre incident, CFMEU officials threatened to stop work on a Lendlease project in Adelaide if a union flag was not moved to a more prominent position. I cannot understand how a union flag is going to improve safety on a building site. It is clear that union thugs have been running rampant on building sites and engaging in thuggish behaviour since workplace relations minister Shorten's decision to fold the ABCC. I am going to give a few more examples of what has been going on, Mr Deputy Speaker, and please understand that I have cleaned up the language from these quotes and removed many terms that would be considered grossly unparliamentary. But listeners can use their imagination. Many of these examples involve the militant CFMEU. In the interim report of the recent royal commission, it was found—and this is not ideology; this is evidence—that Fair Work building inspectors were subjected to violent and intimidating behaviour by a number of CFMEU officials on multiple occasions at two significant constructions sites, the Ibis Hotel in Adelaide and Barangaroo in Sydney. One CFMEU official made offensive comments to an inspector including mouthing the word 'dog' through an office window; and saying 'You're a grub, why are you here, go away. You're lower than a paedophile you grub'. The royal commission referred these matters to the Commonwealth and South Australian Directors of Public Prosecution. In the Grocon incident in Brisbane a CFMEU official said to a Grocon-employed foreman: 'Hey scabby, gay boy, gay boy, gay boy, scabby'; 'It's amazing what people become, once a union delegate hey', 'He used to run with us?'; 'Lowest sort of dog ever'; 'Think you would know better than to go against the unions'; 'You know when all this is over, it's just beginning for you then isn't it, the union covers the whole of Australia.' </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my associates in Perth jumped in a lift on a site and as he got in two CFMEU officials got in with him; by the time he got out on the third floor he was shaking in fear for his family because they had threatened to attack and imjure his family while he was on a worksite—they knew where he lived and they would go around and do it. Why would anyone in Australia want to protect that sort of behaviour? In a case in Sydney, a CFMEU official who had been asked for entry permits said: 'No we're not leaving. You're a pack of murderers, we're gonna get you.' In Western Australia, on 10 March 2014, Justice North restrained CFMEU Construction and General Division WA Branch Assistant Secretary Joe McDonald from entering the premises of four named Brookfield Multiplex companies, in addition to related entities, in the Federal Court of Australia. The consent orders declared that the union, Mr McDonald and the branch's other assistant secretaryhad breached section 348 of the Fair Work Act when they coerced Brookfield Multiplex, the head contractor on the Fiona Stanley Hospital project. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The examples just go on and on and they extend into financial malpractice as well. This is happening right now on our building and construction sites, and yet the Labor and Green parties—which by the way take plenty of donations from the unions—block the tried and tested solution to clean this up. It tells you everything you need to know about those two parties. We all know about the relationships between Labor spokemen and union leaders in this place, including the disgraced CFMEU. It does not matter what the CFMEU does—Labor will continue to do their bidding in parliament because Labor are controlled by the unions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the personal cost of all this lawlessness—the crime and antisocial cost—is the economic cost. We have a fair idea what this cost is because we have the evidence of data from when the ABCC existed. During this time the economic and industrial performance of the building and construction industry significantly improved. A 2013 Independent Economics report on the state of the sector during this period found that building and construction industry productivity grew by more than nine per cent, consumers were better off by around $7.5 billion annually and fewer working days were lost through industrial action. The lost productivity from union lawlessness is a real concern in my home state of Western Australia. There is construction going on all over Perth at the moment—especially in my electorate of Swan. The industry provides many jobs for workers in small business, large enterprises and contractors. My son works in the construction industry as an apprentice bricklayer in the building industry, and hopefully he can have a rewarding life working in the construction industry.</span>

In the government's policy to improve the Fair Work laws, the coalition government committed to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission to once again ensure the rule of law and productivity on commercial building sites and construction projects, whether on-shore or off- shore. I am sure we will hear from many other speakers on the other side of the chamber who will look after the unions and the practices I have just described. So I support the bill and hope that it is passed by the parliament.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak against the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No.2]. It seeks to reintroduce measures that are offensive to Australian values and that infringe basic human rights; it is a bill with a false premise—namely, that there are special dangers in the building and construction industry that require unacceptably draconian measures in response. The truth is there are real dangers in the building and construction industry, as there are at sea and on the wharves—and they are principally dangers to the safety and wellbeing of the workers who build Australia and who connect our island nation through maritime freight and transport to the rest of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has returned this bill to parliament entirely on the basis of cynicism, and entirely to suit their own narrow political purposes. It is disappointing to begin our parliamentary work in an election year with a piece of ideological propaganda masquerading as legislation. It is disappointing that our work here, which should be focused on the big social and economic challenges like climate change and affordable housing and mental health, is instead occupied with partisan manoeuvring. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that Australians want to talk about the important issues that will shape our future, yet we begin this year as we ended the last—with an attempt to misrepresent the labour movement, to demonise workers and the unions that represent them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill goes further than that because it offends against a number of critical human rights principles—and no-one should be sanguine about that, least of all those who profess to understand the importance of individual rights and liberties. Others have quoted Nicola McGarrity and Professor George Williams from the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales, but I want to repeat their analysis for the benefit of my constituents. They have said, quite plainly, in relation to the powers that this bill would seek to re-establish:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the ABC Commissioner's investigatory powers have the potential to severely restrict basic democratic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those rights and freedoms are fundamental to our way of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no tolerance for criminality in Australian life. Where that occurs—at a work site or in a boardroom—it should be dealt with by the responsible law enforcement authorities. If there are instances of fraud or misconduct within any industry, be it the construction industry or the financial advisory sector, those cases should be investigated and pursued in the courts, as has always been the case. But let's remember that the Cole royal commission—all $60 million and 23 volumes worth—resulted in not one criminal prosecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am always concerned that people should approach these issues with some reference to the real world, and so I encourage members to revisit the recent ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span> report on the tragic deaths of two young men that occurred on a Jaxon construction site in Perth in 2015. Mick Buchan of the WA branch of the CFMEU has quite rightly pointed out that the under-funding of workplace safety mechanisms and oversight resources has meant that the danger to life and limb in the construction industry has grown. That is something that people must recognise whenever they hear the term 'militant union', because the fact that unions like the CFMEU and the MUA are strong in their response to unsafe working conditions flows directly from the fact that too many workers in those industries do not come home or come home with serious injuries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put things in perspective on the question of the need for regulatory reform, let's also remember that, while two royal commissions, costing the Australian taxpayer $140 million, have resulted in 150 recommendations for further investigation—but, as yet, no criminal prosecutions—11,000 workers in the last year alone needed to have $22.3 million recovered in back pay by the Fair Work Ombudsman. That is why Labor, on behalf of working Australians, is proposing more effective regulation to protect workers from underpayment, sham contracting and other forms of exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has so many important and urgent challenges that it really seems bizarre that we should have to deal with this reheated folly the government has brought before us. It is an approach the Australian community thoroughly rejected when it removed the Howard government. It is an approach that was thoroughly rejected in the form of the Orwellian Work Choices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude by saying that the shadow minister cut to the heart of the issue when he said that workers in the building and construction industry should be subject to the same laws as other workers. It is a matter of basic fairness, and it is a case that has been made with great clarity, detail and force by my colleagues.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:56</span>):  The construction industry is one of great importance to the Australian economy. Construction projects across the country provide thousands of Australians with jobs, with homes and with businesses, and with hope. These are an important contributor to national gross domestic product and economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With more Australians choosing to build their own homes and with business construction increasing with the coalition government's proud record of $50 billion—a record—infrastructure investment and the private investment sector right across this wide brown land, the need for a reliable and professional construction industry has never been stronger. The coalition understands fully the importance of a strong construction industry. It is vital that we have the homes, businesses, roads, bridges, hospitals, schools and other projects which communities need. But it is just as vital that those people who build the projects do so in a professional, reliable and, most importantly, a safe manner and safe environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time that I have spoken in parliament about these facts. It is not the first time I have praised family owned building companies and the importance of a strong construction industry, particularly as we think about building better and more resilient regional communities and economies—and I am most interested in those regional communities. Nor is this the first time that I have called on the Senate and colleagues here in this House to accept that the Australian Building and Construction Commission actually worked. It is as simple as that. Yet, here we are, more than two years later, and there are findings of a new royal commission which demonstrate the extent to which union lawlessness has eroded productivity gains and the advancement of regional development right across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a government, of course, who respect the rights of workers to the rule of law, to a safe and secure workplace and to choose to join or to not join the unions based on their own preferences. We are a government who know that high-rises over cities and witches' hats on rural roads mean jobs for people and multiplier effects for local communities, including those in my electorate of the Riverina. This bill, the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2], is about ensuring exactly that—the building industry doing what it does best. Ours is not a plan to unfairly target a scrupulous industry, nor to place in jeopardy the construction projects the economy needs. It is simply a plan to reinstate the ABCC—a successful agency of the Howard government—to ensure that our construction industry can do what it does best. Australia is a country with an international reputation of building things, of getting on with the job, of getting stuck in and of having a go—a fair go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, this government is very serious about building the roads, bridges, inland rail and other infrastructure programs that our country so desperately needs. The Deputy Prime Minister—the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Warren Truss—is getting on with that job. This is a vision replicated throughout the private sector as well. All this bill does is complement that intent. It is the reintroduction of a genuine, independent and strong watchdog to uphold the rule of law and to protect workers and constructors. In doing that, this bill will improve productivity on building sites right across the nation, whether the project is onshore or, indeed, offshore. In a nutshell, increased productivity and less red tape will mean more jobs for Australians in the construction industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rule of law, however simple, is the solid foundation for everything for which we stand in this parliament and this country. It is hardly a controversial idea. All this bill is suggesting is the reintroduction of a strong watchdog which favours the rule of law. But there are operators within some unions who are determined to stymie this development and have workers used simply as political pawns rather than as a part of a construction project. It is important to reflect on the fact that the ABCC was introduced by the Howard government in response to the Cole royal commission into the incidence of union thuggery and the compelling evidence of the need for reform within the industry—and that was in 2001. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABCC came into effect in 2005, and the industrial performance of the building and construction industry improved significantly. The statistics back this up. Productivity in the building and construction industry grew by more than nine per cent. Consumers were better off by around an annual figure of $7½ billion. Importantly, fewer working days were lost to industrial action. This was the finding of an independent economics report on the sector during the time the ABCC was in effect that was published in 2013. Those statistics are staggering. More than anything, those statistics demonstrate that things were working effectively under the ABCC. Consumers were able to get the construction jobs they had commissioned finished within a reliable period. The country's GDP benefited from strong growth within the community, meaning there would be more jobs and opportunities for workers, and those workers spent more days in paid employment and lost fewer in industrial action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABCC was established because there was a problem, and this was a watchdog with the imprimatur to fix it. However, the Gillard Labor government came under sustained pressure from their mates in the union movement to undo all the good of the strong and effective watchdog—and what a shame that is. Labor, knowing it owes its dues in many senses to those mates in the unions, procrastinated for years. The former government ordered a review into the watchdog's effectiveness and the building code. The then minister responsible—now opposition leader—the member for Maribyrnong, caved in to union demands and watered down a previously effective watchdog, more's the pity. The opposition leader cut the watchdog's funding and replaced it with a powerless observer to the scenes of militant unionism we saw on display in this nation thereafter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember the scenes in Melbourne merely weeks after the ABCC's abolition of violence on the streets of the Victorian capital. There was violence, union protesters intimidating many people within the community on the picket lines and attacks on police horses. It was the bad old days of the militant unions at their very worst. We all heard the stories of those workers within the construction sector who were berated for not joining the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, such that posters were even made to advocate running those non-union members out of the industry. Shame! We all know these are disturbing stories. It not only makes a mockery of the Fair Work Act and Supreme Court orders to end the process or to respect the right of people to not join the union should they so choose, it also had an impact in an immeasurable way on the investment in and the confidence of the industry itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hinkler said in his contribution this is not a union witch-hunt. He is right. On this side of the House we do understand that there is a role for unions to operate—constructively—within the Australian economy. I was a union member for 21 years, but I also support and understand the right of people to not join a union if they do not wish to do so. People should have that right in Australia, and it should be respected. This was not something afforded to those workers who were labelled 'scabs' and worse, those who simply wanted to turn up to work on a major construction job somewhere and get the job done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hinkler was also correct when he spoke about the other side of the resources boom within rural and regional areas, particularly in the parts of Queensland he represents, where there was a construction boom. This was a great injection into many communities, and it simply worked better when there was a strong regulator in place. In cities such as Gladstone—in the member for Flynn's electorate—Townsville and other parts of central Queensland, there were massive projects which provided many jobs and opportunities to local people, and the multiplier effect of that is critical. In regions such as those, it is important local workforces are also engaged to ensure our regions can get the most out of the local multiplier effect and to build stronger and more resilient communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lyne made an important point in his speech in this debate about the justification this government has for the reintroduction of the ABCC. We have campaigned on it, and the member knows that. He is someone who was a candidate for Lyne at both the 2010 and 2013 elections and he knows well that the Liberal and National parties have been serious about this change for some time. We have taken it to the people twice. We have introduced it to this House before and we are serious about ensuring Australia's construction industry has a strong and independent watchdog.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate there is strong support for these measures too. The Riverina's construction industry is not heavily unionised. However, local contractors and sub-contractors should and do apply to work on major projects around the region. Ryan Knight, the owner and operator of Viewco Glass, a very successful company in Wagga Wagga, praised this legislation and the importance of a strong and independent regulator. He told me, 'As Viewco Glass is an employer of 30 local people, we support an independent watchdog for disputes that arise in any future dealings with small and large construction projects.' Mr Knight served as president of the Housing Industry Association throughout my electorate for three years and only recently retired because he was at his term limit. Mr Knight understands, as do many in the Riverina's construction industry, that we should have a strong watchdog in place to ensure, alongside good employers and a constructive union, that workers' rights are respected and upheld, that the rule of law is upheld and that the consumer can get what they want out of the construction industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important bill. It is an important debate. It is far from a union witch-hunt, and it is something that our colleagues in the other place must consider properly. Simply, the ABCC worked effectively and well when it was in place under the Howard government. Unfortunately, it was abolished because the Labor Party owed its dues to its Labor mates in the unions who do not share our view of a strong and reliable construction industry and would rather use the rights of their workers as some sort of, it is sad to say, political pawn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to put a strong regulator in place. We have to respect the rule of law. The workers' rights should be respected, including the right to not join the union if they so choose. The statistics demonstrate that this is an undeniable fact: the ABCC worked. This bill is simply cleaning up the mess of its watered-down replacement. I certainly commend it to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Terence Cole's royal commission under the Howard government led the way for the establishment of the ABCC. I want to read what he said in a letter to the editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that appeared yesterday, and it is very pertinent to this debate. His letter, headed 'Opponents of the ABCC should explain why they back unlawful conduct', read:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The main recommendation of the 2001 royal commission into the building and construction industry was the introduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Its purpose was to reintroduce the rule of law in the industry. That was necessary because of widespread unlawful conduct. The commission established that such conduct was detrimental to the economy, and thus to the Australian people, as the increased costs of such conduct were passed on to the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2007, after the introduction of the ABCC, savings due to the reduction in unlawful action were assessed at $3.1 billion per annum. In 2012, savings due to reduction in unlawful action was assessed by the Master Builders Association at $6.3 billion per annum. On any view, benefits to the economy due to the effectiveness of the ABCC in diminishing unlawful conduct, were very great.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2012, the then government, whilst recognising the need for strong measures to maintain the reduced level of unlawfulness in the industry, altered the arrangements and abolished the ABCC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2015, the Heydon royal commission report established that unlawful conduct was again prevalent in the industry. Such conduct carries deleterious costs to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Surely it is incumbent upon those who oppose the reintroduction of the ABCC to explain how it is to the advantage of the economy, and to the Australian people who bear the great costs of unlawful action, to have an increased level of unlawfulness in the building and construction industry which the ABCC has demonstrated it can suppress, but which existing arrangements do not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not have put it better myself. There we have it from Terence Cole, whose royal commission led to the foundation of the ABCC. He has put it so well, and it is so pertinent to this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many examples of unlawful conduct in the building and construction industry. On 19 June 2015 the Federal Court fined the CFMEU and five of its officials more than half a million dollars for unlawful conduct at the $40 million Australian government funded Common Ground housing project for long-term homeless people. In its penalty judgement the Federal Court said the conduct 'was a deliberate stratagem on the part of the CFMEU'. The court went on to say that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An industrial organisation, be it an employer organisation or an employee organisation, which persistently abuses the privilege by engaging in unlawful conduct cannot expect to remain registered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many, many more examples. In Grocon &amp; Ors v the CFMEU &amp; Ors in 2013, the Victorian Supreme Court found the CFMEU guilty on all five charges of contempt of court orders following the proceedings initiated by Grocon. In 2014 the CFMEU was penalised $1.25 million for its contempt and was ordered to pay costs, and Justice Cavanough said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The court must visit the defiance of the CFMEU with a penalty which will not only adequately respond to the scale of the defiance but also act as a general and specific deterrent. No fines of the level previously imposed could do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is right through it. The ABCC needs to be reintroduced. This bill does just that, and I commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a>  In there you will find, unless it was cut out by the editors, the story of the founder of the Country Party. A lot of people claim to be the founder of the Country Party, but I think most would agree that the real leader, and the person who really founded the party, was Jack McEwen. At 28 years of age, Jack was a really big dairy farmer. He owned three reasonable sized dairy farms at that stage. He called a meeting of the dairy farmers throughout Victoria and there was a huge roll-up. He said: 'From now on, all of the milk gets sold through a cooperative. You can only buy milk through the cooperative and we're putting a decent price on our product, because I am sick of living in a galvanised iron shed on a dirt floor eating rabbits.' What we are talking about here is collective action; it is a trade union type action taken by farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Three of the wealthier, more established families in the industry cast disparaging remarks upon Jack McEwen and his idea and said flatly that they would not conform. So Jack dragged them out the back and belted the hell out of them physically and then dragged them back in, much the worse for wear. And he said: 'They've seen reason now. Let's get on with the meeting.' And from that day forth he was called Black Jack McEwen. For those of you who are not as old as I am, Black Jack was a sock filled with sand; you belted people with it and it left no marks. I am serious!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another person called Black Jack, though it is not used quite so familiarly. This is a bloke called Anthony, who did exactly the same thing in the banana industry. He was a very famous leader of the Country Party. His son was Doug Anthony, who was Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and one of the greatest ministers who ever served in this place. It was exactly the same story. He got all the banana growers together and said: 'Hey fellas, from now on all the bananas get sold through a cooperative.' This was collective action. We achieved it in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is all right for people to criticise trade unions, but you want to know a little bit about the history of your country before you come in here and shoot your mouth off. One hundred years ago—probably 110 years ago now—one in 30 of us who went down the mines never came back up again or died the horrific death of miner's phthisis of the lungs. Deputy Speaker Kelly, if you doubt my words, walk through that door. There is a magnificent portrait of the first member for Kennedy. He left this parliament dying of miner's phthisis of the lungs. Andrew Fisher, the third Prime Minister of Australia, left parliament dying of miner's phthisis of the lungs. His dad had already died of miner's phthisis of the lungs. The first Labor Premier in the world was Anderson Dawson. He left parliament dying of dust on the lungs. Do not doubt it for a moment. In a magnificent work on the social history of Australia: 'Of the men that worked for over two years digging the sewerage ditches in Sydney—over 2,000 of them—every single one of them who worked for more than two years died of miner's phthisis of the lungs.' You can sit and spit upon trade unions as much as you like. But we could be still out there and dying. Don't think it would not be happening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I attended a rally by the CFMEU, in Brisbane, over safety conditions in the building of a tunnel in Brisbane. The ETU was involved as well. They said, 'They are ramming things through. It is getting more and more dangerous and we are having more and more accidents.' I attended another rally, over the same issue, three weeks later, because a man was in hospital dying from an accident that had occurred two days before. You can say, 'We won't allow any people to look at safety issues.' And we the workers can die. Here is a case of it. That worker happened to be a bloke called Sam Beveridge, as it turned out, from my own home town. In fact, his brother was mayor of my home town, Charters Towers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lady came to see me, today, lobbying on this issue. She had lost her husband. He had spoken to the union that morning and had said, 'I'm really worried.' The union bloke said, 'I can see you are desperately worried.' The man said, 'It's a really dangerous job you're asking me to do, but I'm not going to ask any young blokes to do it. I'm going to do it myself.' He died as well. I do not know how many people have died as the result of a lack of safety in this building. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not going to sit here and be hypocritical enough to say that the builders' workers union were angels. There were a lot of very bad things taking place. They come under the CFMEU, and I have known the CFMEU, the coalmining union, all of my life. Whilst I have had a lot of punch-ups with them through the years they have never broken faith with the people they represent. When they took over the building workers' union there were a lot of people in there who had broken faith, with the people they represented, for their own gain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has not been easy for them to weed these people out. But over the recent leadership—the honourable shadow minister, here, is Michael O'Connor's brother—they proceeded. There has been a lot of blood everywhere—figuratively speaking—in ridding the union of a lot of bad people. A lot of those people who had been got rid of have made allegations to try to get themselves off the hook. That has brought us to where we are at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say not on behalf of the Liberal Party but on behalf of what is left of the National Party, which does not exist in Queensland as it is an affiliate of the Liberal Party, that their founder was responsible—we could have continued living on dirt floors and galvanised iron, working for nothing and eating rabbits! But if there was going to be change there had to be an amount of coercive pressure.  I do not resile from using that statement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the history of Australia there is a man who was the wealthiest man in Queensland—he died with the highest probate ever paid in Queensland. When you go to my home town of Charters Towers his name, Richard Arida, is up there. It was 1882. He broke faith with all the rich people in society and gave, in today's money, $1 million to the strike fund, because this man could not live with his conscience knowing that people in his town were dying on a continuous basis. If anyone in this chamber has doubts about this, at the mine my son worked the roof collapsed. It was in the early part of last century. It killed 27 people. At the other end of the electorate, at Mount Mulligan, in one explosion, in one hour, 72 people—every male in the town of Mount Mulligan—died in that explosion. If you think we can go on and not have representatives of the workers to be able to defend us in these situations, you have another thing coming. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister spoke about the rule of law. That is rather interesting. There are three great pillars of the rule of law, and one of them is your right to silence. We all watch the movies. We all watch the television. 'You have the right to remain silent' is the first thing they say when they arrest you. Well, you do not have it in the building industry! You get put in jail if you remain silent. So do not come in here and preach about the rule of law, because you are spitting upon the rule of law in this legislation. If you want to fix up bad things, you make the effort of going in there and weed out the grafters who have pulled stunts when the concrete is being poured, and getting paid, personally—in their own pockets, not in the pockets of the union—and you track them down and put them in jail. Do not take away, from a whole branch of industry in Australia the right to work safely. I go no further than the brother of the mayor of Charters Towers. I go no further than the first member for Kennedy, when I walk through the door, there. I go no further than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, your right to remain silent is a very important law. This legislation takes away your right to remain silent. And not only does it take away your right to remain silent; it also says that you have to give evidence. If you are asked to give evidence, you are compelled to give that evidence. Now, there would be very few places on earth where the law says that. We know that in some countries, China being one of them, there are still cases going on today where this sort of thing happens, but it is not in their legislation. This might be happening in countries in Africa, but it is not in legislation; it is just discretionary power. This is going to be put into legislation. In our state, the union is affiliated with the ALP, so my party gets nothing out of it; we did not get a cent from this trade union in the last election; there is no benefit for us. But why we have remained such strident, staunch supporters of this union is over the issue of section 457s. They were not introduced by the Liberal Party; they were introduced by the Labor Party. To their extraordinary shame in the history of Australia, they introduced them. In fact, they were bringing in 160,000 workers a year. But why I love this union, even though it is affiliated with the ALP in my state, is that their president stood up and said to Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, 'You must understand, Prime Minister, that we will not tolerate the jobs being taken off Australians and given to section 457 workers, undermining our pay and conditions and taking our jobs off us.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said in this House a number of times, the last government, the ALP government, and this government, the LNP government, in their wisdom, are bringing 650,000 people a year into an economy that is generating only 200,000 jobs. And I ask the question: where are you going to get the welfare money to pay for 450,000 people each year who are going on the dole? Of course, I did not get an intelligent response, but an intelligent response would have said, well, most of them are here for only four years. But I tell you what: no-one was game to give that response, because everybody knows that they are not going home; it is ridiculous to even talk about them going home—the student visas and the section 457s. And Tony Abbott, two weeks after, when I asked the question in parliament—I do not want to flatter myself that he took any notice of me, but, all the same, it was two weeks after I asked the question—attempted to clamp down on the over a million people who are overstays on section 457s or student visas. He tried to clamp down. I mean, it was not like we were going around with a whip, flogging people. We asked them for their identification; that is all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the way the Australian media fell upon Abbott, you would have thought he was General Custer at Little Bighorn! And within four weeks he was gone from the prime ministership—a very salutary lesson to anyone in this place who tries to enforce the overstays. When they are here, they are here. Have a look at the American election campaign. Watch any of the debates and see how much of that debate is about the Latinos who are in America illegally—whether they should be sent home or not. But I have not noticed anyone in America sending them home. That is not the real world. That does not happen. So, the very distinguished minister for welfare got up two weeks later and said that half of the federal budget will go to welfare within 10 years. It is a quarter now; it will go to half. And you whistle and I will point where that half is going—$650,000 being brought into an economy that is producing only 200,000 jobs and has over 200,000 school leavers. You do not have to be Albert Einstein to add it up here and figure out where this is going.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But they are taking our jobs out from under us, and the only institution that I know of in this country that has fought courageously at great expense to themselves has been the CFMEU, and today I pay them a very fine tribute. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  As a little bit of background on myself, before I came into this place I was always a member of a union. I was with the PKIU and also in the Police Association of New South Wales all my working life. For 35 years in the workforce, I was a member of a union and proud of the fact that I always got paid a good day's pay for a good day's work. So, I am really appreciative of unions myself. But there are also times when something goes wrong within unions, and sometimes it might be a union official.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I rise today to support the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2], which re-establishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission. I represent an electorate where the future of this industry is vital for workers, bosses, business owners and the local residents. In Macarthur there are many new housing developments and new suburbs being built. These include new homes in Oran Park, Harrington Grove, Gregory Hills, Spring Farm, Elderslie and Macarthur Heights. These new developments will accommodate an extra 200,000 new residents in my electorate over the next 25 years. That is a population increase of more than 300 per cent, a huge number of new residents who will rely on the stability and efficiency of this industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The building and construction work taking place in my electorate employs thousands of workers from Macarthur and south-west Sydney. They make up a major part of the industry that is stimulating our local economy and keeping locals employed. There is no doubt that the industry is vital to job creation in my electorate. It is also an essential sector of the Australian economy. In fact, it is the third largest employer in the country. That is why it is imperative that the Australian Building and Construction Commission is re-established. It is a strong watchdog that will maintain the rule of law to protect workers and their employers in this industry and improve productivity on building sites and construction projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor abolished the ABCC in 2012 the commission was replaced with a weaker regulator. At the same time, Labor also removed certain provisions that addressed problems of industrial unlawfulness in the construction industry. Under the current legislation, the Fair Work (Building Industry) Act, standards of behaviour in the industry have declined; there is no doubt about that. The industry has returned to its previous practices, where disputes are violent and thuggery and disregard for the rule of law thrive, and that is very unfortunate. This bill we speak on today will reverse Labor's changes to the laws that underpinned the Australian Building and Construction Commission before it was abolished in 2012. The ABCC will replace the Office of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate and will put in place stronger and more effective laws that existed under the former Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main objective of this bill is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building and construction work. This will ensure that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. It prohibits unlawful industrial action, unlawful picketing, coercion and discrimination. In Macarthur and across the nation the construction industry provides many jobs for workers in small business and large enterprises and for contractors. If we combine this with primary and secondary businesses that directly supply to the construction industry, we are looking at very strong figures in terms of employment and output.</span>

Maggie being Maggie, it was full of good, solid, practical advice—blunt and forthright. Of course, by then Maggie was the veteran of two successful preselection campaigns—one in 1993, when she went on to win the seat of Macquarie by just 165 votes, and another in the year of 1997, when she won the right to contest Macquarie for the ALP again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Maggie won the seat of Macquarie in 1993, although it was on different boundaries to those of the 1940s, she was very conscious of representing the same seat that Ben Chifley had held for Labor. In her first speech to the House of Representatives, she told the story of meeting Ben Chifley when she was a little girl. She said she had been impressed by his 'quiet strength'. Maggie herself had plenty of strength, but 'quiet' was not a word that many people would have applied to her. She was fearlessly outspoken on the issues that mattered to her. She was a fierce advocate for the community she represented and which she loved so much. She was an advocate both inside and outside our parliament. She stood up against injustice and unfairness wherever she saw them. At her election, she joined what was then quite a small number of women in the parliament and in the federal parliamentary Labor Party. There were just 13 women in the House of Representatives then, and nine of them in the ALP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was not at all a welcoming an environment. Her first bound copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> arrived embossed with 'Mr Deahm'. But Maggie was not one to take a backwards step. When then Treasurer John Dawkins addressed a female Liberal MP as 'sweetheart' after taking her interjection, Maggie did not hold back when <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> asked her opinion. It was an example of the 'boys club' in the House, she told the paper. 'It was sexism.' It did not matter that John Dawkins was one of her own. And Maggie did not hesitate to condemn what she termed as 'patriarchal' attitudes from some members on the other side of the chamber, either. She was frank and unashamed—an advocate of the rights of women to work, to have access to child care if they needed it, and to have access to safe and affordable abortions. She is also remembered as a strong advocate for improved social policy in our parliament and in the Labor caucus. She left her mark on Labor's policies in income support, aged care, carers and veterans payments, and health policy, especially around the management and treatment of breast cancer.</span>

She said that it was the most fulfilling time in Maggie's life—in her very full life. In that email, Maggie's niece Cynthia also asked me to thank the members of the Katoomba branch of the Australian Labor Party: Remola Hollywood; Trish Doyle and Adam Searle, state MPs; Ross Free; and Senator Cameron, who is with us this evening. </span>

But I think for women of my generation in our party, Maggie's greatest legacy was her example—unapologetically outspoken, unashamedly passionate about the things she believed in, unafraid to stand up for herself or for anyone else who needed it. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  Mr Speaker, I would also like to express my condolences to the family of Maggie Deahm and value her wonderful contribution to this House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise tonight to welcome Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk's plan for a new high-frequency Brisbane Metro Subway System. This will slash travel times for Brisbane commuters and will deliver a revolutionary seven-kilometre high-frequency—every two minutes—subway system linking the bus interchanges at Woolloongabba and Herston in my electorate. This will mean higher frequency and faster travel between the suburbs to the city, while reducing travel times and reducing congestion. It will utilise sections of the south-east and inner-northern busways, crossing the Victoria Bridge and entering a new portal in the Adelaide Street area to connect with the existing King George Station.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this plan, people's journeys from the suburbs to the city and home again will be much faster. This outstanding public transport innovation will remove almost 200 buses per hour from the Brisbane CBD streets. It is such great news for residents of my electorate who live and work in the CBD. By comparison, Labor's uncosted light rail proposal will see the successful Blue CityGlider shut down and closed and would only free up 18 buses per hour. The LNP is the party of the future and this policy embodies our determination to make Brisbane a world-class city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Brisbane Metro will carry up to 18,000 passengers on opening and this will grow to 30,000 long term—compared to Labor's light rail proposal, which will only cater for 3,000 passengers. Labor has once again shown their lack of talent for policy formulation. It is empty. It is hollow. It is uncosted. It is pie-in-the-sky stuff. Labor's light rail trams proposal on city streets is going to make congestion worse; it is not going to make it better. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's proposal is just another one of those fanciful ideas and another investigation. We have had 20 studies done and they have all amounted to nothing. Lord Mayor Graham Quirk has a plan. He will deliver the Brisbane Metro for our city. Just like the vital Kingsford Smith Drive upgrade in my electorate, Labor's lord mayoral candidate will rip it up. He will rip up the Kingsford Smith Drive upgrade and he will stop the construction of the Brisbane Metro.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both these projects are absolutely vital for the city of Brisbane. The Kingsford Smith Drive upgrade will reduce congestion for residents in Ascot, Hamilton, Clayfield and the north-east corridor of my electorate. It will also allow greater capacity for busses and cyclists to access the CBD, with specially designated lanes and safer roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Opposition to the Brisbane Metro and the Kingsford Smith Drive upgrade is more recklessness from Labor, and I know the people of Brisbane will see through Labor's rhetoric and stick with the lord mayor's proven track record. These projects are absolutely vital to deal with a looming bus infrastructure capacity crisis that will choke our city if we do nothing. Labor just want to rip it up, delay and have yet another investigation. The time for all of these reviews is over, and the time for Brisbane Metro is now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the construction of the Brisbane Metro is in the inner city, it will also benefit commuters from middle and outer suburbs who are currently spending increasingly long periods of time in bus gridlock. The benefit having 200 fewer buses on our CBD will allow for other network improvements in the inner, middle and outer suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the federal member for Brisbane, I know our city needs this vital and important project. I will be working with the lord mayor to present his proposal to my federal colleagues, and I know that residents and businesses are crying out for this. The Brisbane Metro will cut travel times substantially. It will be quick and easy to get on and off and IT will improve efficiency for Brisbane locals—</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  It is fully costed, that is the most important thing. You can interject all you want. It will be great for local residents, businesses, travellers and the tourism industry and the many people we have visiting our wonderful city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the lord mayor's plan, Brisbane is heading in the right direction. Our city cannot risk Labor. We need the Brisbane Metro and we need the vital Kingsford Smith Drive upgrade. Labor have said they are going to oppose both of them. Lord Mayor Graham Quirk and his team have a vision for a better Brisbane. I am very proud to be working with him, and together we are a going to be standing up for Brisbane.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  The Baird Liberal government is engaging in one of the worst cases of environmental vandalism in our community in a very long time. On 28 December, right in the middle of the Christmas holiday period, the Liberals cranked up the chainsaws and began removing the century-old fig trees that line Alison Road in Randwick and Anzac Parade in Moore Park, adjacent to the Sydney Cricket Ground. Despite significant community objection, despite the opposition of Randwick City Council, despite opposition by former Liberal members of parliament from the state and despite a workable alternative the trees have been destroyed and are being removed. These iconic trees, which are part of Randwick's heritage and character and have been there for close to a century, are now being destroyed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1914, when troops marched from Kensington Racecourse down to the docks at Circular Quay, to get on boats to go and serve in Gallipoli, they walked past these trees. In 1917, when Randwick Road was renamed as Anzac Parade in honour of the Anzacs, these trees were there. In 1930, when Don Bradman made his first international hundred at the SCG, these trees provided shelter and shade to patrons as they walked in to see the great man score his first century. In 1970, when John Sattler had his jaw broken in the grand final against Manly, these trees were there. And at the 2000 Olympics, when the marathon runners ran straight down that road, on international television people throughout the world saw these significant, historic trees. In Alison Road, when Phar Lap won the 1929 AJC Derby, if you look at the pictures, in the background are these significant fig trees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These trees formed part of Centennial Park, bequeathed to the people a century ago by the likes of Henry Parkes to provide parklands, recreation and enjoyment and to provide shade and support for native wildlife. And they were destroyed by an incompetent Liberal government because of a $660 million cost blow-out in the light rail project and the mismanagement of the light rail plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alison Road is a particular type of incompetence. You would not believe what they have done on Alison Road. The stop that the light rail provides for racecourse patrons was originally planned to be on the racecourse side, on the southern side of Alison Road, which actually makes a lot of sense. Patrons would be able get off the tram and walk straight into the races, and when the races are finished they would walk straight out and get straight on to the tram. But because the New South Wales Liberal government have messed up the size of the tram and the number of people that they could carry, and because they have messed the negotiations with the ATC about their administration building, they have moved the stop across the road. Guess where to? Centennial Park. They are going to take 30 historic trees out of Centennial Park and have patrons coming out of the races at the end of the day, after being on the drink all day, negotiate one of the busiest streets in Sydney to get across to get on a tram! It makes no sense at all. It is completely illogical and this change was not in the original environmental impact statement. It is a particular kind of incompetence from a Liberal government that would do this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does not have to be this way. We can have the light rail project and we can preserve these trees. If the government had moved the stop back over to the Randwick side, we could have preserved these trees. If the government had moved the alignment of the light rail line just one metre to the east, near the SCG, there would be no need to take out these trees. The trees on the SCG side of the road are in the electorate of Wentworth, the Prime Minister's electorate, and I have been fielding calls in my neighbouring electorate of Kingsford Smith from the Prime Minister's constituents asking if we can do anything to get the Prime Minister to get on board and stop the destruction of these trees. We are getting a lot of phone calls. Greg Hunt announced a new policy of this government some weeks ago to 'green our cities, to create urban canopies'—</span>

                  </a>  The Minister for the Environment announced a new policy to 'cool down the cities and provide tree canopies to green our cities'. Here we have the possibly the world's greatest example of urban tree canopies—and what are the Liberals doing? They are chopping them down! It is completely illogical. It is contrary to the policy that has just been announced by the Minister for the Environment and it is hypocritical. I call on the Prime Minister, and Premier Mike Baird, to stop the destruction of these trees. We can have the light rail project and we can preserve these historic Randwick trees.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>): Australia Day is truly a time that we reflect on the wonderful things that make us Australians. As the member for Lindsay, I am incredibly proud of the Lindsay residents and the residents of the Penrith local government area that were recognised for their longstanding contributions to our city. One of the people I was really inspired to see recognised with an OAM was John Farragher. Many people know John's story as a man who had an accident playing rugby league which has seen him live his life in a wheelchair. For all of my life I remember seeing John Farragher's face every time I walk into Panthers. He is the smile that greets you and every other person as they come through the doors. John Farragher has seen adversity in his life, but he is one of possibly the most inspirational people I have ever met. He is a true blessing to our city and a wonderful choice for an OAM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another wonderful citizen who was recognised was Norma Thorburn. Norma is a wonderful citizen, passionate about the St Marys region and preserving its history. St Marys has such a proud history. Werrington, which sits between Penrith and St Marys, was in fact the home of Sir Henry Parkes. Our town has done so much. Peter Dodds McCormick was a St Marys schoolteacher. In fact, Peter Dodds McCormick wrote our national anthem. These are things that come from St Marys. These are things that are home to the people of Lindsay. Norma is absolutely passionate that our children understand the pride that we have in our region, that the father of our Constitution lived in our area and people like Peter Dodds McCormick lived there and taught St Marys schoolchildren.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is Rodney Watson. Rodney, lives in St Clair, which is in McMahon but still part of Penrith. Rodney has devoted his life to Penrith District Netball. Penrith District Netball is one of the biggest netball organisations in Australia. He is passionate about seeing netball go above and beyond. Netball is one of the largest, if not the largest, participation sports in our country. It is wonderful for a region that has challenges with obesity and diabetes to have so many people participate in sport. Rodney has seen himself elevated to state and national roles. He is an incredible ambassador for netball. He is a wonderful advocate for our community. Once again, a very worthy recipient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris Holden and David Trist received awards for their community work along a range of organisations. Chris has spent 37 years in Rotary, where he helped build Hope Cottage. He was a tennis coach, part of the Nepean Medical Research Foundation and a foundation member of the local Probus Club. David Trist is now 90. He has been part of Nepean Legacy since 1960. Also, he was in possession of a Japanese flag which was captured during World War II. In recent years he had the flag returned to the Japanese village by my good friend, Deputy Mayor of Penrith, Ross Fowler. Townsfolk cried as they saw the symbolism of the sacred flag being returned to the monastery. Dr Jay Chandra, a local optometrist in Penrith, was recognised for his Fiji Eye Project in 2005. So many people were recognised. I am truly honoured to represent a region that has contributed so much to our wonderful country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally in Penrith we also saw Citizen of the Year awarded to my good friend, Wayne Wilmington. Wayne and his wife, Ann, have done so much with regard to the Relay for Life, but also for the Music for Life Foundation, where they have raised money for medical research. They have raised money to help so many others. Wayne is also an SES volunteer and does so much work in raising money for local causes, including cancer. He is always around town helping people and volunteering for people. With all the infrastructure projects going on in and around Badgerys Creek, Wayne, who is a Luddenham local, has been crucial in helping the community in Luddenham advocate for what they need to see road upgrades for the Northern Road, which will require some degree of land acquisition. Wayne is a truly wonderful recipient to be the Penrith Citizen of the Year. I would like to commend all my local citizens and thank them for their work.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  Tonight, I will reflect on the passing of three people who will be long remembered in the electorate of Blair. Gabrielle 'Gaie' Madden was a trailblazing educator who taught thousands of Ipswich children. Born in 1922, Gaie's teaching career began in a one-teacher school west of Maryborough. She crammed 45 students into a single classroom. Some years later, she transferred home to teach at St Mary's College in Ipswich. In 1960, Gaie became the first full-time female teacher appointed by St Edmund's Boys College—then Christian Brothers College. She would teach at that college for the next 27 years with distinction and compassion. To students, teachers and parents, she was simply known as 'Mrs M'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gaie lived a busy family life. She married Brian in 1946 and they welcomed five children: Peter, Dennis Brendan, Anne Marie and Jim. Jim Madden, her son, is the state member for Ipswich West and a very good friend of mine. Gaie lived her life with great faith and dignity. She was an inspiration to all. She was a beloved member of the Catholic community of St Mary's Catholic Church in Ipswich. Gaie passed away peacefully on 18 January this year. St Edmund's College noted that her 'profound legacy as a caring educator of generations of young Ipswich men will endure'. How true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Henry Taylor was the first person I met at Dinmore meatworks when I started working there at my first job as a teenager. My father, who also worked there, introduced me to Henry and said, 'This is Henry Taylor, the Labor man.' Henry was that and much, much more. He was born in Brisbane in 1928 and attended school in Ipswich and left there to start working at the Oxley meatworks. He met Shirley, his beloved future wife, at a wedding. Shirley was charmed that day, telling a friend, 'See that man in the hat? I'm going to marry that man,' and she did. Henry and Shirley were married in 1952 and had three children, David, Ian and Tynee. Later, Henry took a job at the Dinmore meatworks. He began a social club for workers that still operates today. He was a supporter and a constant fundraiser for the Ipswich Hospice. To this day, workers at the Dinmore meatworks donate some of their pay to Ipswich Hospice. Henry started that payroll deduction. He owned and trained greyhounds and loved a bet at the Raceview TAB. His best and most successful greyhound was known as Henry's Folly. It was very successful in Ipswich but could not quite replicate that success at the track outside Ipswich. Henry played soccer until he was 40 years of age, when his knees gave out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without doubt, Henry was a proud Labor man and a very well respected member of the meatworkers' union. He was awarded life membership of the Australian Labor Party and was a fixture at my local branch, of which I am a member and the president, the Raceview Flinders Branch. As a booth worker he was without peer. He handed out how-to-vote cards in his porkpie hat. He looked like something out of <span style="font-style:italic;">Division </span><span style="font-style:italic;">4</span> on polling day. Everyone loved Henry. He was a champion of the local community. Sadly, he passed away on 4 January this year. Vale Henry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greg Turner was another member of my local branch and perhaps the roughest of rough diamonds. Sadly, Greg passed away in late January 2016. Born in 1949, and a boilermaker by trade, he did his apprenticeship in the railway workshops in Ipswich. He was a proud union member who was active in the fight for workers' rights during the dark days of the Bjelke-Peterson regime in Queensland. He was a fixture on the campaign trail. I first met him and got involved in his life when I ran for parliament in 2004. Greg has been right beside me for 12 years. We have criss-crossed the electorate over that time. It is impossible to tally the number of cups of coffee and skinny flat whites I have drunk with him in the last 12 years. I have campaigned with Greg more than any other single person in Blair. He was always there for me, despite his poor health towards the end of his life. He was keen for a chat about politics or rugby league and would only disappear from my mobile offices to get his little transistor beside his ear and listen to what was happening at the races. If he could get a tip, from a jockey or from anyone, he loved it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a great friend of my father Al when his cancer was getting him and he was bedridden in Brisbane. He would visit my father every week, and for that I am eternally grateful. He was a character—a very interesting fellow but loyal and true to me. At times he intervened when people were having a go at me on the campaign trail. On one occasion, I had to restrain him at the Fernvale markets to stop him decking this local bloke. I was trying to convince this fellow to vote for me at the next election, so I did not want Greg decking him! He was great to deal with and I will miss him terribly. He is beloved by the Labor Party. To his son, Tim, and to the rest of the family, you have our condolences. I am so pleased that the last thing I did was to give him an RM Williams Christmas card voucher and tell him how much I appreciated the work he did in the last 12 months. He was very special to me and I really loved him.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  As federal members of parliament, we are used to receiving people or talking to people in our offices or out in the streets about federal issues. There is no doubt about that. But, of course, sometimes federal issues are not people's main concern. It is those things that happen right in front of their house, in front of their eyes or somewhere in the community which will often be the issue that they want to bring to us. As I always say, if it is important enough for someone to bring it to me, it is important enough for me to try and do something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the suburbs of Australia one of the great scourges and irritations for people, for the constituents of all our suburban electorates, is the issue of hooning—the reckless driving and the noisy, somewhat destructive activity that some people with performance cars get up to. At night, constituents, our families, worry about whether that loud noise—the spinning of wheels; the squealing of tyres—is going to result in a car coming through the front wall or into a bedroom of our houses. There have been plenty of examples of that. In the electorate of Cowan there have certainly been examples of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is what to do about it. For a long while I thought that we could do things like put speed humps on roads, and that would help with speeding issues and also with hooning. But, while that strengthens the resistance to hooning activities in those streets, the reality is that there are still other streets nearby, and we cannot afford to engineer out this hooning. We cannot afford to try to counter human nature and attitudes of hooning with only these sorts of engineering efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a problem for a long time, and I think it is a problem, as I said, throughout the country. Recently the police minister in Western Australia, the Hon. Liza Harvey, was talking at a forum that my wife, a councillor in the City of Wanneroo, had organised. The minister was talking about how Western Australia has covert hooning cameras and how effective they were becoming. They have been trialling them since June last year. I think this is an excellent way in which we can help protect the streets of our suburbs, and suburbs within Cowan as well. Often people in their houses are worried about going outside and trying to identify that number plate on the car or the driver. It is so important that there is this technology that now exists that can record details about those cars at night and during the day and help the police to identify who is responsible or which vehicle is doing these sorts of dangerous and reckless activities that risk lives and irritate so many people in the suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raised this issue with the police. As I say to my constituents, and as the police say as well, if there are hooning incidents happening, the best thing to do is to report it to the police, and through that weight of numbers the police can identify where the priorities are for police attendance or police positioning of their vehicles and personnel or even these cameras. These things are linked together: the more reports the police have, the more chance there is of getting these cameras or the police in a position to try and catch the hoons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a limitation. According to the police, the hoons know that, if they say they cannot recall who was driving the car, they can get away with just a $500 fine—no loss of demerit points and no seizure of the vehicle. This is a major limitation. What is required is a change of law in Western Australia, and probably also in other states, so that the owner of the car has a strict liability for the actions of that car. They either have to give up the name of the person who was driving the vehicle and that person accepts all the responsibility, or they wear that responsibility themselves. That is what is required in Western Australia, and I hope that the Western Australian government will pursue that very soon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  Of late, we have read a lot in the papers about the GST and recently I have had something to say on that matter. It has been in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and in the local newspapers that I stand against a rise in the GST; a rise that we were told was never going to happen. That was a guarantee that was given when this pernicious tax was first introduced. We were guaranteed 10 per cent—no further. The guarantee was that you would have to get all the states to agree and that would be politically impossible. We now know what is happening. The cuts forced on the states by the federal government, $60 billion of them, have forced the state premiers into this difficult position. We now find that a tax that was never going to rise is going to rise from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. I joined the Labor Party in 1992 to oppose such a 15 per cent GST tax and I continue to oppose it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first thing this is about is that it is a regressive tax transfer from poor people, the working class and the middle class to the wealthy. That is the first thing it is—a regressive tax transfer. It is putting on consumption taxes, which are regressive taxes, and cutting income taxes and corporate taxes for the rich. That is what this is all about. The second thing this is about is locking in spending without reform or efficiency. On the one hand, we have this bizarre coalition of people who want to give the top end of town a tax cut and load the whole of the burden of fiscal consolidation onto pensioners, the working class and the middle class. On the other hand, we have another group of people who want to lock in spending in hospitals and health but without reform and without efficiency. We all know that there is a vital need in health for reform and efficiency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a debate recently, and there will continue to be a debate. It is good to see Paul Keating out there today talking about what a lazy tax this is, and how inevitably, if it rises to 15 per cent, it will only go in one direction from there—to 20 per cent. After that, who knows? Those opposite are addicted to consumption taxes. They have been talking about them the entire time I have been a member of a political party. The entire time it has always been, 'We want a 15 per cent GST with a broad base on food.' We know the effects of this tax will be regressive and will be inflationary—and now, thanks to Paul Keating, we know it will lock in inefficient spending and a larger public sector.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Territories, Local Government and Major Projects</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  Last week I was proud and pleased to be involved in a number of Australia Day events in my electorate of Bradfield to mark this important national milestone. I attended a citizenship ceremony at Bicentennial Park in Pymble conducted by Ku-ring-gai Council at which 110 people from 24 countries became citizens of Australia. The speech at the event was given by Nimalan Rutnam, a successful local lawyer who told us he was born in Sri Lanka, left due to difficult local circumstances in his teenage years, studied in India and in the United Kingdom, and subsequently made his way to Australia where he has been a citizen for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Ku-ring-gai Council and the mayor of Ku-ring-gai Council, Cheryl Szatow, for this successful community event. I congratulate everybody who became a citizen at the event. I particularly want to acknowledge Gaie Carrick who was born in the UK and over 25 years ago, I believe, met Geoff Carrick, a friend of mine who grew up in and remains in Bradfield. Geoff met Gaie in the UK and brought her back to Australia, where she has lived for some 25 years. This year she became an Australian citizen and I was very pleased to be at the ceremony where that occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in the day, I was able to attend a citizenship ceremony at Hornsby council chambers conducted by the Hornsby mayor, Steve Russell, in his normal affable and entertaining style, where some 41 citizens from 14 countries became Australians; eight people originating in China, seven people from the Philippines and six people from India. I had the pleasure of speaking subsequently with Harpreet Singh, who came to Australia from India six years ago and is training to be an accountant, and with Jie Hua, who came from China eight years ago. Both spoke to me about how pleased they were to become Australian citizens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It caused me to reflect that it is highly appropriate that, as a nation, one of the things that we do to celebrate our national day is to hold citizenship ceremonies, because our nation is so diverse, with over one-quarter of adult Australians born overseas. In my own electorate of Bradfield, over 40 per cent were born overseas and 30 per cent speak a language other than English at home. According to the most recent census report, nine per cent are of Chinese background, two per cent of Indian background and over two per cent of Korean background. The diversity in the electorate of Bradfield is in line with the diversity that we see all across this great nation of ours. Our country is one of the great successful immigrant nations of the world, and it is highly appropriate that that is one of the things we mark and celebrate on our national day, on Australia Day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  In 2011, in her address to the United States Congress, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our future growth relies on competitiveness and innovation, skills and productivity ... and these in turn rely on the education of our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These words still ring true today, but now we have a Prime Minister who talks a lot about agility, disruption and innovation, but Labor knows that the true enabler of a prosperous Australia, underpinned by equality and opportunity for all, is education. And that is why last week, Labor announced our plan to ensure that every student in every local school gets the support they need to reach their full potential. Our schools policy will start with undoing the damage caused by this Turnbull Liberal government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To begin with, we will implement and fund the Gonski reforms on time and in full, meaning every student in Australia will benefit from increased needs-based funding. The Gonski review warned that too many children were missing out on the education they need due to a lack of resources. It is vital that the reform continues as planned and in its entirety. Labor's 'Your Child. Our Future' plan will see an additional investment in our education system of $4.5 billion for years 5 and 6 of Gonski and a total provision of $37.3 billion for the package over a decade. Labor's plan, based on evidence and needs, will deliver the most significant improvement in school education in Australia for two generations. It will ensure a strong focus on every child's needs, more individual attention for students, better trained teachers, more targeted resources and better equipped classrooms, and more support for students with special learning needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, in my electorate of Newcastle, Gonski is already making a difference, and Labor's determination to honour the full six-year needs-based school funding agreements is very welcome. Late last year, I had the pleasure of attending Gonski Week celebrations at Kotara High School and New Lambton South Public School to see firsthand the positive impact that Labor's Gonski funding is having on local schools. Teachers told me that the smaller class sizes meant more time with each student, ensuring no-one was falling behind. Intensive literacy and numeracy programs have had enormous benefits for students, helping them to learn these fundamental skills to set them up in life. Speech pathologists, English coaching, homework and lunchtime tutors were all making a difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it stands with the Liberals broken promises and slashing of education funding, my electorate of Newcastle alone is set to lose more than $195 million in funding over the next 10 years. These cuts, launched by Tony Abbott and confirmed by Malcolm Turnbull, will further entrench inequality. Without investment in our schools, Malcolm Turnbull's talk about innovation and the future economy is just that—it is just talk. It is time for this government to get on board and at least ensure the funding of years 5 and 6 of Gonski.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WHITELEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  My electorate has lost an upstanding, respected and passionate man from our midst. Trevor Marshall, from Smithton, passed away on 21 January, and his impact on our community will be deeply missed. Our communities long for men and women who are committed to the care, service and encouragement of others—Trevor was one such man. Motivated by a deeply-held Christian faith and love of his God and people, Trevor has left deep footprints for us to follow, if only we are prepared to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would class Trevor as a good friend—one of those people that you may not necessarily see that often but, when you do, they speak into your life. They encourage you in their intentional desire to build you up to make you a better person, a stronger and more compassionate person. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trevor's positive impact on us as a community was only enhanced by his life partnership with his wife Merle—what a double act they were: full of love for others and they practically delivered this love by way of amazing hospitality. At Trevor's farewell service, all those in attendance were offered the opportunity to write down the way in which Trevor had impacted their life. I determined to make that statement today. As my electorate would know, my wife and I spent a considerable amount of time in full-time ministry in the 1990s. It was through this time that we spent a great deal more time with Trevor and Merle. Leadership in any capacity has never meant to be easy, and the church was no different, especially in Tasmania in the 1990s. I knew it and felt it, and Trevor knew it and felt it. He was a great encouragement to me. I watched and admired a man confront his own personal journey with tremendous humility and at significant personal cost. This personal cost did not prevent him from leading others to a new and exciting future with the genuine intention of seeing people's lives change and his community changed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the words of his great friend, Macky Popowski, who led the service, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">His Christian faith carried him through the storms of his life and, rather than destroy him, it strengthened him. He hated religion and the religious spirit that comes with it, but loved God and loved people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trevor always said that I should invest my skills and my experience and passion in the wider community. He was a strong supporter of my efforts to earn a place in the Tasmanian parliament. He always told me that he was praying for me and supporting me and I knew that he was. Whilst one should avoid scoring peoples' personal prayer efforts, I can tell you when Trevor prayed publicly you were lifted off the floor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Smithton, whilst not isolated, had lots of needs for young people and Trevor, with Ernie Quilliam and Doug Poke, had a vision for a youth camp in the late 1960s. They built that youth camp. It is still used today serving hundreds—if not thousands—of young people. Trevor put his effort and money into young people, and we thank him for the legacy that he has left. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of my community, I know when I say to you Merle, to Rob and Lesley, Christine, Tim and Jonathan thank you for sharing your husband and your dad with us. Trevor Royce Marshall has left his mark on his world and he will be missed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  On Australia Day I had the privilege to preside over a citizenship ceremony held in my electorate of Fairfax at Palmwoods. Joe Kearnay of Woombye-Palmwoods Rotary donated trees. The ceremony was to naturalise 22 new citizens who had made a serious commitment to become Australians. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The local community started work early at 7 am decorating the hall with large Australian flags and historic memorabilia. Local Lions clubs and Scouts set up food and drink stalls outside the hall as the community gathered to support each other and to join in the ceremony. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jenny McKay, the local councillor, and I attended, and I was fortunate to have the assistance of Mike Burns as our MC. The hall had a capacity for 400 people and, when I commenced the ceremony, it was overflowing with Australians ready to welcome our new citizens into the community. Large hampers and trees were prepared by members of the community to present to each new citizen to celebrate the occasion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a historic occasion for each of the candidates for citizenship and their families. It was also a historic occasion for the descendants. Citizenship was not just for those present but it would change the destiny of generations yet to be born. It was their decision but, in so doing, they were committing future generations to our country and all that it stands for. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To see the smiles on the candidates' faces, to present each of them with their naturalisation certificates, reminded me how all of us in this place and throughout the nation have a responsibility to do all that we can to make our new Australians welcome in our society. At times like this, we remember what unites us as a people. It is greater than our differences that we may have from time to time. We are not just citizens of Australia but citizens of the world. We need to remember, as a wise man once said: we are all mortal; we all live on this one small planet; we all breathe the same air; and we all want a good future for our children.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an immense privilege to see the quality of people that we have in the Australian Defence Force. I do not have a Defence background; I do not have a history of exposure to the sort of people we have. I wonder whether it is because of the training we invest in those people, or whether it is the screening process of the people we take into the Australian Defence Force. But, as result of this experience, I have become a strong advocate for the calibre of the people that we have serving in our armed forces in other conflicts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a cost to them. One of them said to me: 'Can I show you a photo of my five-year-old who is starting school this week. My daughter thinks the word "mother" means telephone.' Distance is a factor. The hours that they work are immense. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have reason to be very proud. I learnt how IEDs are made. They put a ball bearing in a syringe. That IED is then put into a toy so a child will pick up the toy and the limbs of the child will be blown off. It does make you realise that our freedoms are bought at a cost and that we are doing very good work there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Operation Resolute Support, where our Defence forces are training the Afghani defence force to put security back into their country, is a very worthwhile program. It will take some time, but it is very worthwhile. I also think providing air support to the Iraqi defence force is very strategic and measured. For the record, I do not think we necessarily need to put Australian troops on the ground. What we should be doing is providing support to those countries, training them to be well armed and to put security in those countries, so that they can then retake ground and ensure prosperity for their countries. If they have a level of security, ultimately that will bring jobs and investment back into those countries and lift people's standards of living—and that is the great aim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The men and women currently serving in our Defence forces in the Middle East are people of whom we can all be proud. I spent Australia Day with them. It was very moving to hear them with their bands playing <span style="font-style:italic;">Khe Sanh</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">I Was Only 19</span>. It does resonate that those two songs were sung by Australian troops on Australia Day. These are men and women of whom we should be proud.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:47</span>):  I rise today to talk about the devastating impact of the forced closure of the Tweed Valley Women's Service in Murwillumbah. I will continue to call on the New South Wales government to act urgently to restore full funding and reopen this important service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tweed Valley Women's Service was forced to close after their funding was just suddenly cut. The service was advised on 17 December 2015 that their contract had suddenly been cancelled by their lead agency, On Track Community Programs, meaning $580,000 in New South Wales state government funding along with 13 jobs were suddenly cut. I, like so many in our community, was shocked and outraged that this forced closure had occurred, given the vital services they had been providing, particularly for those women and children fleeing from domestic violence. Just as disturbing is the fact that it occurred just before Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tweed Valley Women's Service has provided counselling, education, mentoring, crisis accommodation, transitional housing and support for women and children experiencing domestic violence. The service has been in operation in the Tweed Shire for 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The North Coast National Party MPs and their state government have chosen to ignore locals by failing to assist with this very desperate situation. The complete inaction by the New South Wales government and local National Party MPs Thomas George and Geoff Provest is both shameful and irresponsible. I am also calling on those National Party MPs to explain to the community: why did their government allow On Track Community Programs to suddenly cut this funding from this important service? Both state members have shown that they are unwilling and unable to do the job they were elected to do, so I will continue to work with the executive of the Tweed Valley Women's Service and our community to have this service reopened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the service, I have made representations to Premier Mike Baird and also to the relevant New South Wales ministers, Brad Hazzard and Pru Goward. We have also launched a petition demanding the New South Wales government restore funding to the service. The community response so far has been overwhelming. I would like to commend the executive of the service and all those locals who rallied together to support this cause. So far they have had three separate protests, a community meeting, a march and a rally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all seen reports that violence against women is at epidemic proportions. As a former police officer, I saw firsthand the devastating impact of domestic violence on women and children in our community. We have a crisis that needs to be addressed, and services like the Tweed Valley Women's Service are desperately needed and their full funding must be restored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This situation can be fixed today. It can be fixed right now, so I call on the New South Wales Premier to listen to our community, act and fix this.</span>

These included: Aldinga and Sellicks Spinners, Knitters, Weavers and Felters; 50-plus Activity Club; Spectrum Art Group; Southern District Midweek Ladies Tennis Club, Morphett Vale; Morphett Vale Tennis Club; Lions Club of Hallett Cove and District; Noarlunga Community Children's Centres; Perry Park aged care; and Cove sports club.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also many individuals who made a significant contribution. I would like to recognise Jo and Carey Habel, who brought in stuffed animals; Rhonda Smith, who donated a Christmas tree, decorations, dog food, toiletries and toys; and Peter Rayner, who donated cinema tickets. Ian Macfarlane and his two children, Martin Harderer and Ian Fitzgerald, all generously donated to the appeal as well. Everyone in the southern suburbs of Adelaide who donated showed a huge amount of compassion and care, and this was heartening to see.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Christmas can be a very difficult time for many people. It can be a difficult time for people who are struggling, who do not have the food and toys they need. Our community worked very hard together to ensure that Christmas was a little better for those who had not very much. So I would like to again thank everyone who participated, who collected donations. It was a wonderful effort and it was wonderful to see that the giving spirit was truly alive and well this Christmas.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Chief Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  I would like to rise today to speak about the importance of education in a community, and the fantastic role that schools play in the towns in my electorate. While obviously the backbone of schools is the teaching staff, they rely heavily on administration and assorted staff to help run those schools. Today I would like to acknowledge the contribution of Dubbo resident Melva Blake. Melva has just retired after 46 years in administration at Dubbo West Public School. In an era where people not only change jobs on a regular basis but also change careers, it is very refreshing to know there are people who are dedicated and who are prepared to contribute 46 years to one job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that time Melva has worked with 12 different principals, including the current principal, Eileen Day. They speak with great admiration for the way that Melva has kept West Dubbo Public School on an even keel. She has been the face at the front desk that greets parents and new students alike. Over those 46 years, she has been involved in the education of several generations of the same family. It is important that we have role models like Melva Blake, who can show that it is important to be dedicated to a task, that they understand the importance of education, and that they understand that for an environment to be conducive to good learning, an institution has to be run in an efficient, caring and professional manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So for the thousands of students who have been touched by Melva during their time at West Dubbo Public School, on their behalf I would like to congratulate her on a wonderful career. I wish her all the best in her retirement. Melva is a pocket dynamo. I am sure she will not be idle. She is very involved in many organisations in the Dubbo community. Least of all, she will be able to spend more time with her husband, Mike, and her adult children.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:58</span>):  Over the past three months, the Liberals have been flip-flopping all over the place in an incredible display of economic policy confusion. Today the Treasurer has yet again reaffirmed his determination to increase the GST to 15 per cent. This is damaging consumer confidence, but when you overlay that with speculation about an early election, that is a sledgehammer into consumer confidence! People in the community are now extremely worried.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, this Treasurer and this Prime Minister have had over three months to make up their minds about a tax package. The government has occupied the Treasury benches for 2½ years. All of the policy talks, all of the possible tax changes, all of the expenditure priorities—every single one of them—have been assessed and sit in the bottom drawer at Treasury. Yet the government remains completely paralysed, and the consequence is very damaging for consumer confidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government moved into their offices and then they sat on their hands. Indeed, they went overseas for a while. The Prime Minister went overseas. The Treasurer went overseas. We still do not know what the government are going to do. The Prime Minister might take the occasional tram, but you can be absolutely sure he does not walk in the same shopping aisles as the average Australian. He would not be considering a 50 per cent increase in the GST if he did. A very big tax on almost everything, tens of billions of dollars, is what we are looking at from this government. Yet they remain paralysed, which is hitting consumer confidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Historical experience is very relevant here. The historical experience shows that, after compensation is paid to households, governments always collect a lot less revenue than they thought they would. In fact, the original GST package introduced by Treasurer Costello ended up costing the government $21 billion after compensation was paid. That is, that government had to spend $1.15 for every dollar raised from the GST when the package was first introduced. The point I am making here is that, after compensation, which will be inadequate, there will be no money. There will be no money for a corporate tax cut. There will be no money for additional spending on health and education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why are they putting the country through this farce? The answer is pretty clear. The long-held ambition of the Liberals and the Nationals is to shift the tax burden onto low- and middle-income earners and away from corporates and the wealthy. The long-term agenda of the Liberal Party is to serve the top table first. The long-term agenda of the Liberal Party is to comfort the very comfortable. That is the long-term agenda of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. There can be no other explanation for why this farce of incoherence continues, damaging consumer confidence.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  In the past two years our Liberal-National coalition government has got on with the job of building safer and more efficient roads in Central Queensland. Today I am pleased to inform the House of yet another significant milestone worth $166 million in my electorate of Capricornia. The official construction has started on a major upgrade of the Eton Range crossing on the notorious Peak Downs Highway, west of Mackay. In late January I officially inspected the site to launch the start of formal building work following earlier geo-engineering trials. This project is about saving lives on the busy mining route which has been the site of far too many horrific and deadly accidents involving heavy vehicles and trucks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth noting that this is in fact a state-run highway and, as such, is really the responsibility of the Queensland Labor government. But the federal coalition is contributing all of the $166 million to fix the notorious Eton Range crossing. The highway is predominantly used to serve the inland coal-mining sector. The new alignment between Nebo and Mackay will reduce the gradient of the highway over the Eton Range, making it safer to accommodate heavy trucks. I am proud that our federal coalition government is delivering for the truck drivers, workers, residents, property owners and country travellers who use the Peak Downs Highway in this particular spot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the regional economy will benefit, with around 295 jobs being supported over the life of the project. For industry, especially the coal industry, these works will provide an upgraded crossing for the Eton Range that will improve the safety and operational efficiency of the 35-kilometre stretch of the Peak Downs Highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 4,000 vehicles, including 800 heavy trucks, travel through the Eton Range each day. The highway is the only designated B-double route from Mackay west to the northern Bowen Basin and therefore will provide a vital link for the mining, grazing and agricultural industries in the area. This project involves the construction of two dual-lane carriageways that will reduce delays caused by slow-moving vehicles and improve safety for all road users. The works will also eliminate the straight-line approach to the highway's steep downward gradient. Extra lanes will also be built to avoid the need to close the range for wide loads. Weather permitting, this life-saving construction project is expected to be completed in late 2018.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  Kids have been going back to school across Melbourne's west this week, but this is not the only relief for parents in my electorate. Last week's announcement of Labor's 'Your Child. Our Future' policy will also be a load off the minds of families across Melbourne's west. All parents want their children to do the best that they possibly can at school. As a Labor MP, I want every child in Melbourne's west to have the same chance of succeeding in their studies as a child anywhere else in Australia, and I know that the member for Lalor, in the adjoining electorate next to me, shares this vision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should not matter how wealthy a child's parents are or whether their family speaks English at home or whether the child has a disability; our schools should be able to respond to the individual needs of our children and give them what they need to reach their full potential. That is what 'Your Child. Our Future' is all about: building an education system that turns the tide on the growing inequality in Australia and ensures the future economic prosperity of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Your Child. Our Future' would implement and fund the Gonski education reforms on time and in full. Every child in Australia would benefit from the needs based education funding delivered by this package. The policy would deliver an additional $4.5 billion to our schools over 2018 and 2019 and a total of $37.3 billion over the next decade. This funding would allow for a strong focus on every single child's needs, more individual attention for students, better trained teachers, more targeted resources and better equipped classrooms and more support for students with special learning needs. Needs based school funding is particularly important for areas like Melbourne's west, with large numbers of students from financially disadvantaged backgrounds and from non-English speaking homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's 'Your Child. Our Future' policy is particularly welcome relief given the scale of the cuts to schools funding implemented by the Turnbull government. Before the election, the Liberals promised 'no cuts to health or education'. They promised that they would 'match Labor's school funding dollar for dollar'. But, since the election, Malcolm Turnbull has continued to trash the Gonski needs based education funding reforms and cut $30 billion from our schools. Over 10 years, Malcolm Turnbull's cuts mean that over $160 million will be ripped out of classrooms in my electorate. These cuts are equivalent to sacking one in seven teachers, a cut to the average school of $3.2 million and about $1,000 less support per student per year. The impact of these cuts is very real—enough to employ around 160 extra teachers every year for the next 10 years in my electorate alone. These cuts will impact every classroom in every school across Australia, and schools and teachers needing the most assistance will be the hardest hit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without investment in our schools, TAFEs and universities, Malcolm Turnbull's talk about innovation and the future economy is just that—talk. You cannot fund an education system or an innovation system on buzz words alone. At the next election, there will be a clear choice when it comes to education: invest in our children and our nation's future with Labor or more of the same cuts to education under Mr Turnbull and the Liberal Party.</span>

While Australia Day is a time to celebrate the founding of our great nation, it is also a time to recognise the people who make our country the great place that it has become.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As families celebrated Australia Day with backyard cricket, barbecues and other great Australian traditions, I had the pleasure of attending the citizenship ceremony and Australia Day awards at the Logan Entertainment Centre to celebrate some of our local heroes. I would like to take this opportunity to commend two amazing people from my electorate of Forde who were honoured at the 2016 City of Logan Australia Day Awards for their selfless service to our community. Quota Beenleigh President Heather Christensen is this year's City of Logan Citizen of the Year. Heather has been a member of Quota Beenleigh for 23 years and has served as treasurer and president. She has also worked as the club's publicity officer and has convened the Quota Beenleigh City of Logan Eisteddfod for the past eight years. As well as mentoring members of Junior Quota clubs at Beenleigh, Loganlea and Windaroo high schools, Heather is an active member of the Beenleigh-Yatala Junior Chamber of Commerce. I would like to congratulate Heather for the wonderful work that she has done and continues to do in our local community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second Australia Day honour went to a long-serving St Vincent de Paul volunteer, Fay O'Toole, who received the Spirit of Logan Award. Fay has been an active volunteer at the St Patrick's Conference of the St Vincent de Paul Society for more than 27 years. She served as president for a number of years and is also an active member of St Patrick's parish. Fay has helped many people in need over the years, and I commend her for the outstanding work she has done in our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia Day in Logan is about not only celebrating some outstanding Australians but also welcoming new ones. At the citizenship ceremony we had the pleasure of welcoming 168 people of 40 different nationalities. I wish all of them every success as they continue to build their lives in Australia and as they continue to contribute to the great country in which they now live.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">On 21st November 2015 our lives changed in the most unimaginable way when our son, Adam Coleman was killed in Mexico.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Adam was 33 years old and had spent half of his life traveling the world and surfing. He, along with his childhood friend, Dean Lucas, was murdered by robbers on a highway in Sinaloa. Their murders were brutal and that is something we will struggle with for the rest of our lives. The section of road where they died is notorious for crime but is a toll road and they probably felt safe enough. They were fluent in Spanish and were experienced travellers who felt comfortable in almost any surroundings. They were killed by men posing as police officers. I can only imagine they felt they were targets for bribery. They have paid bribes to police in several countries and they quite often expect it. We became aware of their disappearance and through the assistance of the boys girlfriends, the car with the boys remains were found. We were informed of this on 28th November.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We were visited by the Australian Federal Police on 1st December and the investigation into the boys deaths started. DNA samples were taken for comparison. The Australian Federal Police came back twice more on the 2nd and 3rd. Both sets of parents then travelled to the USA on the night of the 3rd December and then onto Mexico.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst in the USA we were under the care of the AFP in Los Angeles and Australian Consular Officials. When we were in Los Angeles we were informed that individuals had been arrested in relation to the boys deaths.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We flew the next day to Puerto Vallarta in Mexico and were under the guidance of DFAT officials in Mexico City. We were determined not to leave Mexico without knowing that our sons were on their way back to Australia. This was problematic due to the identification being hard to establish due to the brutality of the assault.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">After five days we moved to Sayulita which is a surfing community and more in keeping with what our sons enjoyed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The repatriation process of the boys bodies was started and we could plan our trip home. We arrived home on the 29th December and Adam arrived on the 1st January 2016.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout this ordeal we have been treated with the utmost respect and kindness by almost everyone we have come into contact with. We would like to thank the Australian Federal Police and the forensic team that came to our house. They are such a professional group and we always felt we were in good hands. Special thanks to Zoe Kyte of the Australian Federal Police who was constantly on the case and took great care of us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We would like to thank all Australian Consular Officials in Canberra, Los Angeles and Mexico City. They were always available to talk to us and were very professional in all aspects of the job.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We would like to thank the Mexican government who helped to resolve this dreadful situation and aided us to get our children home.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">They were very cooperative and never shied away from the horror of this incident. We understand that they are trying hard to make Mexico safe and although we were gutted by this incident we have an affection for Mexico and it's people. We were constantly asked for forgiveness by individuals who had nothing to do with this crime. We know it was five people who were responsible for Adam's death and we bear no grudge against anybody else. We will visit Mexico in the future as tourists and not grieving parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We would like to thank Storm and Courtney Richardson for their help and especially the Hasburgh family of Patrick, Cheri, Jensen and Wheeler. They took us under their wings and made us part of their family. They would not let us be alone on Christmas Day and we are forever thankful for their friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly we would like to thank over a thousand people who gave their money so we could travel to Mexico and bring our sons home. The boys employer in Canada, GS Holdings gave us $8000. It is very humbling when people help you in this circumstance. It shows us that the world is overwhelmingly good.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We don't want people to remember Adam as a victim of crime, but as a World citizen who loved life and everyone he met.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I would like to acknowledge Ken Jolley OAM. Ken was made a life member of the Lismore RSL in 2001 and the Lismore City Council Citizen of the Year in 2011. He is a Vietnam Vet and he is a tireless worker on many causes in our community, not least of all the Westpac Rescue Helicopter. Ken, congratulations on your OAM. Your family—Kerry, Tracey and Scott and their families—are proud of you, and so is your community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tracey, I knew before you did. Just a story about this: on Australia Day, Ken was not there to receive his award. I went to Evans Head later in the day for an Australia Day celebration and there was Ken selling raffle tickets for the Westpac Rescue Helicopter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Spiro Notaras has been awarded an OAM for our community. Spiro was an iconic figure in the Clarence Valley, both in the business and wider community. On Australia Day this year, less than three weeks after his death, Spiro was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. Spiro was aware that he was getting this award before his death, which is very fitting. He loved Grafton and he loved the wider Clarence community. Spiro, you are missed already, and this award is celebrated by the whole community for the amazing contribution you made over many decades. Thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When RSL stalwart Raymond 'Jack' McDonough from the Kyogle RSL Sub-Branch was told he was he was to be honoured with an Order of Australia Medal, his first reaction was 'I am flabbergasted. You don't do it for acclaim, you do it for your community.' That off-the-cuff remark sums up Jack. He is all about community. He served in the Army Reserve for 36 years and the 41st Battalion, located in Lismore. He has a long resume of serving in important community volunteer roles, primarily with the RSL—far too many to mention. I want to congratulate Jack on his award. His children, his whole family—Kim, Leah, Mia, Grant and their families—are proud of you, Jack, and so is your community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention and congratulate Warren Tozer, who was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia, for his unrelenting work in the local community at the recent Australia Day ceremonies. Warren has been intrinsically involved in several community organisations including the Grafton District Services Club, the Helping Hands Committee, of which he has been a member for the past 20 years, and the Westpac Rescue Helicopter, of which he has been chairman for 18 years. He was humbled to receive the OAM; he told a local newspaper that he believes it is more recognition of the organisations; but, Warren, I would like to say that is right, but it is also a recognition of your outstanding and inspiring commitment to our community. I know that Rhonda and your children, Brad and Jo-anne, and their families are very proud of you, Warren, and so are we. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  Today, I stand here in parliament calling on the Minister for Communications to fix the telecommunication crisis in Bendigo and Central Victoria. I have written to the Minister several times, as well as his predecessor who is now the Prime Minister, calling on them to fix the telecommunications crisis in Bendigo and Central Victoria. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is going on is just unacceptable. As example of how bad it has been become, you need go no further than what is happening with some of the fixed wireless towers. There are four towers that were built under the former Labor government—we are talking three prime ministers ago. These towers were built in 2013, yet today, here we are in February 2016, and these towers have not been switched on. All this government had to do was switch these towers on and then people in these areas, businesses and households, would have had access to the NBN. But yet, this government has failed and it is just a mess—a mess created by Malcolm Turnbull. Why have these towers not been switched on? There is an issue with the relay tower. The relay tower was to be built at Mt Carmel, that was scrapped because of planning issues, but the NBN Co. and this government have not found an alternative. It is a crisis that this government is responsible for and a crisis that this government must fix. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to give you an example about what people are saying locally—and when I raise this in social media, when I raise this in our local media, my office and local media are inundated with complaints and examples about what is going on when it comes to their internet speeds and the lack of NBN. Richard Ryan said on my Facebook page: 'It is terrible and one of the main problems in Bendigo. Our speeds vary from 0.3 to about six. Compare this to the office that I work in occasionally in Melbourne that gets consistent speeds of 58. Another comparison with a friend in Frankston, who was lucky enough to get NBN, gets 106. When you are running a small business, it is very frustrating.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another person said, 'We live in East Bendigo, three kilometres from the CBD. ADSL2 isn't available to us. My wife runs her own business from home as a graphic designer, which requires large files to be uploaded and downloaded. It is a daily struggle with frustration and no end in sight.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andie said: 'I'm on the CBD exchange. There are no ports available, so I haven't been able to get ADSL for seven years even though I live in Kennington. I'm very excited about the NBN but, alas, many years on and I am still waiting. My current internet bill is $99 per month.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the crisis this government is creating because they have left Bendigo off the map. I call on the minister again not to just turn the towers on in Central Victoria but to fix the crisis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Recently, I visited the Bonnie Support Services in my electorate. I met with the chair, Betty Green, and CEO, Tracy Phillips. They both have enjoyed more than 25 years experience in the community sector. Bonnie provides services to those in need; not just a roof over their heads, but a range of services for individuals who face very complex trauma. Bonnie provides for women and their children; helping them enjoy their lives as best as possible. They provide services and accommodation to women and their children who are escaping domestic violence. Domestic violence is a scourge on our community. This is the only specialist service available to women in south-west Sydney. Due to the magnitude and very serious nature of domestic violence, many shelters find themselves completely under-resourced and working under strain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homelessness Australia found that an extra $68 million in funding would save 3,000 domestic violence victims from being turned away from crisis accommodation. As part of Bonnie's Going Home Staying Home reform, such funds would enable them to do more work with women and, certainly, to engage with them and their families as they deal with these services. For the handful of specialist domestic violence services left in New South Wales such as Bonnie—they are struggling under the tsunami of demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from living in a safe environment, women need to feel empowered. They need to be able to get themselves out of traumatic situations. Bonnie offers a range of services in that regard to assist their trained staff: caseworkers, tenancy advisers, family and community workers, child support workers and outreach officers. They also give support, which is very important in my electorate, to women from very diverse backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the government's commitment to fight domestic violence—and I remind them to maintain the level of support needed—it is important to protect women and their children. Put simply, domestic violence is not okay. I am happy to be part of a community that holds true to the notion that violence against women is never acceptable. The White Ribbon march in Cabramatta last year was a reminder of this, and an opportunity for our community to remember victims of domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge all staff at Bonnie's, and also the other support services, for making a real difference in the lives of many. Congratulations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to some outstanding people in my electorate of Robertson, who were recently honoured as part of the Australia Day Community Awards hosted by Gosford City Council. The Central Coast has a long history of great citizens who have answered the call to serve our country and preserve the freedoms that we all cherish. Honouring their sacrifice is no easy task, but Andrew Church has risen to this challenge by establishing the Central Coast Interactive War Exhibit, featuring hundreds of items like uniforms, medals, wartime artefacts and weapons sourced from around the world. It really is an incredible exhibition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Opening its doors to coincide with the Anzac Centenary last year, more than 1,000 students, Defence Force personnel, aged care facilities and community organisations have so far seen this exhibit, with plans to attract around 200 students every week this year. I am proud to advise the House that Andrew Church is the 2016 Gosford City Council Citizen of the Year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Young Citizen of the Year is an incredible 14-year-old—Jessica Atkinson. Jessica developed and implemented a sun safety program for primary school children; her own initiative. Working as part of the Beat the Heat initiative, Jessica's innovation also pioneered an online version of the program, increasing the reach and independent delivery to primary schools around our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also recognised a number of other volunteers who are the lifeblood of our community, including the indefatigable and outstanding Clive Blunt, who was honoured for his tireless work with the Gosford community through not-for-profit organisations such as Gosford City Rotary and, most recently, for his organisation of the upcoming Toast the Coast festival on 2 April at Gosford's Entertainment Grounds. Clive has been working with Coast Shelter to ensure that funds from the festival flow back into supporting domestic violence initiatives at Coast Shelter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barney Waters received the Arts, Culture and Entertainment Award for his dedication to the Gosford Musical Society's pit orchestra since 1964. Suzy Miller was presented with an Outstanding Achievement Award for a range of community initiatives, including her local youth mentoring initiative, fundraising and her professional networking group for women. Volunteering Central Coast was honoured for its Community Visitors Scheme, which relies on the commitment and dedication of nearly 50 volunteers. They visit socially isolated people living in aged-care facilities on the Central Coast, and bring hope and support to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A community event award was given to Narara's Ecoburbia Festival, a fantastic celebration of sustainable community development. Last year this attracted 4,000 residents and local business representatives. Our senior citizen of the year was Bob Williams. Since retiring 10 years ago, Uncle Bob has inspired and really connected with his community through initiatives ranging from music and mentoring to men's health. I commend and salute these Central Coast community champions.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the condolence motion for my friend Jim Carlton, who passed away on Christmas Eve last year. The Prime Minister and the opposition leader both spoke eloquently and compassionately in relation to Jim, and I would like to associate myself with their comments. I was unfortunately unable to be at Jim's funeral due to being away at the time, but I understand that it was a great celebration of Jim's life. I regret not being able to be there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got to know Jim well over the last 20 years through the Liberal Party, the Red Cross and his employment with the Boston Consulting Group. I greatly admired what he achieved across all three of those areas but, more importantly, I admired his integrity and his intellect and valued his friendship and counsel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim was one of the great contributors to the Liberal Party and to Australian parliamentary life. He was President of the Sydney University Liberal Club. He was general secretary of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. He was a member of parliament in the seat of Mackellar for 17 years. He was the shadow Treasurer for many years during the Hawke and Keating era. He was the health minister in the Fraser government. It was Liberal pedigree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in many ways the offices that he held were less important than the influence that he had through the ideas he espoused. Jim was an intellect. He had a very clear sense of how Australia and particularly our economic system had to change. He used this clarity to great effect as one of the leading 'dries' in pushing for more free market economics, rooted in the Austrian School's teachings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, within the Liberal Party, we all accept that free, open markets are the best way of organising the economy and generating wealth and freedom. But it was not always like this. Back in the 1970s this was a matter of debate around the world and within the Liberal Party itself. Jim was on the right side of history, pushing for liberalisation. He maintained these views his whole life, including when he was shadow Treasurer during the Hawke and Keating era. In fact, I recall Jim reflecting to me that he used to have Liberal colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s berating him for supporting the Hawke economic reforms which, in many regards, took our template and liberalised the economy. As Jim related to me, colleagues would ask, 'Why are you supporting the Hawke and Keating agenda when we as Liberal party members could make great political mileage out of opposing these difficult reforms, such as floating of the dollar and reducing tariffs?' 'Because they are doing the right thing,' was his response to them. If only members of the Labor Party today would adopt such an approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He left parliament in 1994, having served only a short time as a minister, just a couple of years before our long term in government under John Howard's prime ministership. As he said at the time, 'I am disappointed in not having another opportunity to be a minister. I felt I could be more useful elsewhere.' Jim took up a position as the head of the Australian Red Cross, where he again had an enormous impact in his seven years there. He played a large role in the formation of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, creating one national organisation where there had previously been eight separate blood banks. He received the Red Cross movement's highest honour—the Henry Dunant Medal—in 2007, the medal which recognises and rewards outstanding services and acts of great devotion, mainly of international significance, to the cause of the Red Cross. He was also incredibly influential in supporting the greater fundraising efforts on a national basis, and trying to have one greater national brand around the Australian Red Cross, rather than the state divisions at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got to know Jim particularly well at that time because I sought him out to go and do a secondment at the Red Cross when I was working at the Boston Consulting Group. While there, I would like to think I had a small contribution to make in helping with Jim's agenda in what he was doing at the Red Cross. Certainly, we not only discussed the activities of the Red Cross domestically and internationally, but that time is really when I started to get his mentorship across my broader career, and perhaps influencing some of my thinking in relation to politics and where I might go. He was certainly a great encourager for me in terms of thinking about politics and what I should be doing in relation to positioning myself; always providing me with the articles to read, to bring myself up to speed, particularly in relation to economics. He was certainly an encourager of me standing for parliament when I eventually did. I would say that his wife Di was maybe less encouraging of me going into politics! Perhaps that was from having supported Jim for so long in that role and realising that it can be pretty tough on family life being a member of parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of Jim's time at the Red Cross, he reverted to a corporate career. When he started his career, he, of course, had spent many years at McKinsey, a very influential firm, and he was one of the very first members of McKinsey in Australia and, subsequently, joined Boston Consulting Group, the arch-rival of McKinsey and my old firm. He helped support Boston Consulting Group with an enormous array of projects, particularly those concerning the public sector. Through that he helped the firm, but, more importantly, I think, he made another terrific contribution on the public administration of this country, both nationally and within state governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had great admiration for Jim. I always enjoyed catching up with him, as I did on a very regular basis. In fact, I was due to catch up with him for coffee again in January. I will very much miss him as I know that many people in this House will do so. He was a humanitarian. He was a very decent man. He was an intellect, and a great encourager of younger people who wanted to follow in his footsteps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pass my condolences, of course, to his wife Di and his children. Maybe I will finish with a very nice comment from his son Rob which he apparently made at his funeral, where he said, after his passing: 'I don't know the meaning of life, but I can tell you my dad died happy, surrounded by family, and loved by all who knew him.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  As a former member of this place for 17 years, and a mentor to many after he retired, the Hon. James Joseph Carlton AO has a special place in our hearts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim's dedication and service to his country is something that many try to emulate. After serving as the member for Mackellar and the Minister for Health in the Fraser Government, Jim became the Secretary of the Australian Red Cross where he dedicated his time to humanitarian efforts and the relief of suffering in the world. He continued to support many charitable causes, particularly the Red Cross, throughout his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim's encouragement, advice and support was always very much appreciated. Jim was intensely loyal to his friends. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim was indeed an elder statesman. He has left a lasting legacy in this place, not only in the health portfolio, but particularly in regards to economic policy. When a number of my colleagues decided it was time that we relaunched the Society of Modest Members, Jim was instrumental in the rejuvenation of the group. Many people in this place would be aware of the history of the Society of Modest Members, of which Jim was a founding member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The society aims to promote the use of the competitive market as the best means of providing for human wellbeing. Towards this end, it advocates the progressive removal of anticompetitive regulations and protection and supports effective measures to prevent restrictive trade practices on the part of individuals, businesses, trade unions or governments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The society has a commitment to an open economy and ensuring that state patronage does not grant favouritism. Membership of the society is open to members or former members of the parliaments of the Commonwealth of Australia, the states or territories, who subscribe to the objectives of the society and pay an annual membership fee. The society promotes public understanding of the benefits of the competitive market competition and facilitates discussion between its members and others of a similar mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim realised that, while the society had not been active for a number of years, it was opportune to make sure that there was an opportunity for people in this place to have a forum in which to gather and to debate and to discuss these critical ideas. He not only provided the history in the background to the society for those of us who were very keen to see it reform but he also attended the inaugural event in launching the society not that long ago. We are very grateful for his continual commitment and dedication to these ideas and to the mentorship and inspiration that he provided to many of us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his later years Jim and his wife Di moved from Sydney to Melbourne and lived in the inner city suburb of Carlton. Jim became known as the 'Carlton of Carlton'. He was an integral part of a regular coffee club, known as the 'Carlton Gathering', which met once and sometimes twice a week. This group of intelligent, eclectic and one could say influential individuals shared discussions on a wide range of topics from politics to economics and cooking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many may not be aware that Jim came from an Irish-Australian Catholic family where the value of hard work and education was of paramount importance. Throughout his life he never forgot the debt of gratitude which he owed to his teachers. Jim was a great man, a great contributor and an intelligent friend. He will be greatly missed. To his wife Diana and their children, Alex, Freia and Rob, I extend my heartfelt sympathy on the loss of a truly wonderful man. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="0J4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RUDDOCK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I very much want to be associated with this condolence motion. I suspect I am the first who will speak on this matter who actually served with Jim between 1977 and 1994 while he was a member of the House of Representatives. He was a very dear and close colleague whom I knew well, and I was particularly pleased to be able to be in Melbourne for the memorial service, because it was truly a wonderful occasion to celebrate a life. I had a chance to talk to Di. I had spoken to her before that service and she knows how much she and he have meant to my wife Heather and me over such a long period of time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, interestingly, if you go back and look at Jim's career, his involvement with politics was much before he became a member of the House of Representatives. You will find in his valedictory speech the observations that I knew that he was involved in student politics. Being some eight years older than me when he passed away, he was a student politician long before I was involved at university. He was the president of the SRC at Sydney. He was the president of the Liberal Club, but I know that his engagement was with the Liberal Party under perhaps the greatest mentor that any of us could ever have—Sir John Carrick. Sir John Carrick was, I think, a great admirer of Jim and what he was able to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1956 he got elected to the Liberal Party state council and, in his own speech he made it clear that even then he was a person with very strong views about the nature of Australia. He recalls that he was, in 1956, before Harold Holt did it, instrumental in obtaining a vote within a dozen of overturning the White Australia policy—somewhat courageous at that time. He said, 'They were the kinds of issues I was interested in.' Many of us have heard about his views in relation to the economy but, before I come to that, I wanted to say that this engagement with the Liberal Party in New South Wales led to his appointment in 1971 as the party's general secretary, a title we no longer keep. We now talk about 'state directors'. He was the general secretary of the Liberal Party. He played a very important role in reforming the Liberal Party's campaigning structures, and it may be said that it was probably important to do so, because he was conducting a campaign in 1972 in which the McMahon government lost and Whitlam came to office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that our path crossed in 1973. As the general secretary he was the person who was able to organise the campaign for the federal division of Parramatta when Sir Nigel Bowen retired and I was first elected to this place. I do not know that it was an adornment in every respect that I was elected, but I have to say that, to achieve a very large majority in Parramatta at that time—moving from a 368 that Nigel Bowen had held in the election in 1972—I think looked pretty good on his CV. Billy Snedden was the then leader. Jim Carlton's campaign on my behalf was particularly meaningful to me. I have to say that what it may have cost him was the most expensive by-election that the Liberal Party had ever had to conduct up to that time. There may have been others that have exceeded it since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only natural that somebody like Jim Carlton, who had played such a significant role from his university days in the Liberal Party organisation and who had demonstrated his very considerable achievements in the private sector, particularly in the management organisation, McKinsey, was able to play a role in public life. When I read through his maiden speech—we now call it a First Speech but I am sure it was then called a maiden speech—I found a comment he made towards the end of his address, and I think it is as relevant today as it was then. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, I believe it is necessary for us to have an absolutely creative approach to the new structure of our economy over the next 20 or 30 years—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">he might have extended it—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">and not to assume that we must necessarily be a totally tributary economy of overseas economies. It is necessary for us to look at our own skills. We have in Australia the necessary skills to look at the problem with creativity and imagination. I certainly do not accept that overseas is best. I have worked in places overseas where people did not have anywhere overseas to look and they had to sit down and do things themselves. This is something that some of our best people have done. It is something that nationally more of us should do. Certainly in what is a world problem of youth unemployment and unemployment on a general scale we should have an Australianmade solution which may well lead the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was thinking about these issues very strongly at that time, but it is interesting that when he came to make his own valedictory speech he made this observation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Since I have been in parliament, I have had to become more concerned with the shift that needed to be brought about in Australia from an essentially inward looking and somewhat protectionist society into a liberal market economy—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hear a lot of hear, hears in relation to that—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">that was capable of standing in the world as an equal with anybody else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But interestingly, he moved on to conclude in this way:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Over this period it has worried me that I have been characterised as being solely concerned with economic issues, but I have only ever regarded these economic issues as a means to achieving social outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think those are particularly poignant remarks and, when you look at his life after politics, you can see it working its way through. I am not going to repeat all that has been said about his work for the Red Cross, restructuring that organisation in the way that he did and enabling it to do its task even more effectively as a result. I do not want to talk—as my colleagues have—about his considerable managerial skills that were sought by the Boston corporation. I want to note some of the matters he raised with me as he talked about the way in which better benefits could be delivered for the people of Papua New Guinea, about which I am sure my colleague will speak. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not a great deal that I want to add. I think his record speaks for itself. He was a great Australian whom we will all miss because we kept in touch with him, we saw him and we admired him. I would say to Di that I know the way in which she was revered by him but I know the way in which she supported him in his role, and I thank her for that. I was particularly impressed with the way in which his son Rob conducted the memorial service. His children have each made significant contributions through their own lives and it says much of the family that Alex, Freya and Rob have distinguished themselves in the way in which they have. I am so pleased to be associated with this motion, having served so long with my friend Jim Carlton.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to Jim Carlton—or, as we called him, 'JJ call me Jim', as he was fond of saying to us. I first met him back in 1971, when I was a very young Young Liberal and he took over from the great Sir John Carrick as General Secretary of the Liberal Party. As the member for Berowra has said, they were fairly busy times. He moved straight into running the 1972 federal election. In those days, election campaigning was done individually by the states, so there was no coordinated national campaign. As he said in his farewell speech in this place, he had come out of McKinsey and Co., a world competitive consulting firm, and was running the 1972 federal campaign with a separate advertising agency to the ones used by all other states, with almost no communication with any other parts of the organisation and not too sure about the role he had in front of him. Also, as the member for Berowra and former member for Parramatta said, he then went on to lead us in the great victory in the Parramatta by-election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember quite well the great influence Jim Carlton had in the party in those days. He had an excellent relationship with the Young Liberal Movement, to the extent that at one of our annual revues, which was staged publicly at the Phillip Street Theatre and ran for three or four nights, there was a skit called 'The importance of being JC' that was directed fairly at Jim Carlton and John Carrick. In those days we also had the Young Liberal president, Jim Carey, and a fairly influential state member, Jim Cameron, so the JCs in the Liberal Party in New South Wales in the seventies were quite prominent. Of course, the person who enjoyed that skit more than most was Jim himself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As he said in this place in his valedictory speech when he retired:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When I first came into parliament both parties were essentially protectionist, both supporting the classic, original Deakin labour movement compact of the early 1900s—which was a great social compact but it had become outdated. To us it was a question of how soon that would be understood and how soon the parties would be shifted away from that. Both parties have now moved away from it—both major political groupings—in quite a dramatic way. This change has been tremendous. We did not get much understanding or support from the Labor Party in those early days. I think Peter Walsh, John Kerin and John Button were three who were very sympathetic but, fortunately, when the Labor government came into office a band of people seemed to become converted to the necessity of moving Australia into a more competitive mode. A lot has been done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More tellingly, particularly given the legislation in the chamber today, he went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It has been very frustrating to be in opposition during this period. It has been good to welcome changes as they have occurred. The big single change that still has to occur is in the labour market. Until we have freedom of contract in the labour market, until we break the monopoly position of the unions with coverage assured by somebody else on their behalf, we have not got to the heart of the matter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1977 Jim Carlton joined this place as the member for Mackellar and I moved to Queensland, so I had a lot less contact with him. But on his retirement he became the new chief executive officer of the Australian Red Cross. I had become very involved in the Red Cross in Queensland, so our paths were to meet again. It was wonderful to have him in that role, where he brought so much organisational change and also—I think because of some of his background in the Liberal Party—understood the importance of the volunteer network. Our branches and members in the Red Cross in Queensland appreciated his recognition of the key role that they had to play in the Red Cross.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently Jim moved into other areas, as the member for Berowra noted, and I next had contact with him in his role in Papua New Guinea. His work seemingly never ceased. Even when he retired from one role, he would take on another, usually with even more demands on his time. He also found time late in life to serve on the board of PNG Sustainable Development Program, which was born out of BHP's departure from Ok Tedi. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PNG SDP's long-term presence and investment in the Western Province sought to provide an alternative economy after the closure of the Ok Tedi mine. Jim brought all of his skills from politics, life and the Red Cross to this role—and he needed them all. He genuinely enjoyed this role, even though it was incredibly challenging from time to time. His contribution to the main board and the microfinance arm was considerable. He was genuinely concerned to find a way to resolve recent differences between the government of PNG and PNG Sustainable—differences that remain today and would have benefited from his ongoing contribution. This was a role where Jim made yet another contribution to the world around him. My sympathies to Di and the extended Carlton family. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ABBOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  It is an honour to follow my colleagues the member for Berowra and the member for Ryan in this tribute to the late, great Jim Carlton. I should also note that it is a pleasure to be back in the Federation Chamber after quite a long absence. Jim Carlton had a glittering career. He excelled at everything he did. He was successively the president of the Students' Representative Council at Sydney University—the first Liberal to hold the position—general secretary of the New South Wales Liberal Party, a Minister for Health in the Fraser government, shadow Treasurer in the Howard-led opposition of the mid-eighties, a leader of the economic dries in the federal parliament from the late seventies to the early nineties, a supporter of the free market tempered by compassion and ideals, and also the member for Mackellar on the Warringah peninsula between 1977 and 1994.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As everyone in this chamber knows, the period from the mid-eighties to the late nineties was the golden age of reform in this country, first under the Hawke government, which floated the Australian dollar, deregulated the financial markets and began the process of privatisation of government-owned enterprise—and it did all this with the active support of the coalition—and then under the Howard government, which deregulated labour markets, reformed the tax system and reformed the welfare system through policies such as Work for the Dole. This was done despite the bitter opposition of the Australian Labor Party. The reforming instincts, the liberal instincts, of the coalition from the early eighties through until the nineties, in opposition and in government, have indeed helped to shape the Australian economy, which by 2007 per capita was as strong as any in the developed world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim Carlton was one of the key figures in the Liberal Party, one of the people who converted our party from regulating to deregulating. He was a critical figure in the evolution of our party from an old-fashioned protectionist party that built walls against the world to a party which welcomed the world to Australia, economically and in most other respects. He was John Howard's shadow Treasurer at a critical time in the reform process. He was a friend of John Hyde and Peter Shack, his brother parliamentary leaders of the dry movement. Between 1990 and 1993, along with David Kemp, he was a key architect of John Hewson's 'Fightback!' policy, which in a humble way I helped to draft as a political adviser in the Hewson office. The 'Fightback!' policy was a magnificent political failure but it was a monumental policy success. Nearly everything put forward in the 'Fightback!' policy was eventually implemented: first, sotto voce, by the Keating government and then, with much more obvious pride and determination, by the Howard government. Jim Carlton's spirit breathed through the 'Fightback!' policy. Indeed, Jim Carlton's whole public life is a testament to the power of ideas. He was a minister for less than a year but his ideas still shape our polity and our economy, more than 30 years after that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim was always friendly, cheerful and he was never bitter despite the vicissitudes of his own public life. He was a happy warrior, ambitious not for himself but for our country. There are too few like him and our parliament is the worse for it. Members of Jim's family, particularly his wife, Di, can be incredibly proud of the life of Jim Carlton.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim dedicated his life to public service and began his political career as a student politician at University of Sydney where he was president of the Liberal Club and Student Representative Council. After a successful business career in Britain, Jim served as the General Secretary of the New South Wales Liberal Party from 1971 until his election to parliament in 1977 as the member for Mackellar. Jim was one of the fortunate few parliamentarians to exit at the time of their choosing at his retirement from parliament in 1994. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his 17 years in this House, Jim served as the Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Minister for National Development and Energy in the Fraser government. Jim was very influential at a turning point in our party's history. He was one of the economic rationalists, leading the argument for pro-market economic reform during the Fraser government. While the Fraser government lost the 1983 election, Jim had captured the temper of the times, and the move to liberalise the Australian economy was taken up by the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments which followed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I knew Jim personally from 1987 onwards, shortly after he had been the shadow Treasurer. I had started work with the then deputy leader of the Liberal Party, Andrew Peacock, and had many conversations with Jim to discuss economic and taxation policies of the coalition. From then until 1993, when I departed Parliament House, those conversations continued. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim was a deep thinker about policy issues. At the time he had a strong interest in following the lessons of the postwar Germany economic miracle and the influence of the Freiburg School of economists, who helped guide the pro-market policies of that country. In a very practical sense, I learnt from Jim a lot about the hard work of formulating economic policy in a tough political environment. And yet he did all that with a great sense of humour and fun. While he might not have been aware of it, I regarded him as an important mentor of mine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following his retirement from federal politics in 1994, Jim gave generously of his time and energy to humanitarian aid efforts in Australia and overseas. Jim served as the Secretary-General of the Australian Red Cross from 1994 to 2000, and in 2007 he was awarded the Henry Dunant Medal, the highest honour of the International Red Cross. I kept in contact with him over this time and I last spoke to Jim late last year at the funeral of his younger sister Vonnie, whom I also knew and was one of my constituents in Tathra. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim will be remembered on both sides of this House as a decent warm-hearted and generous person. He was a genuine contributor to Australia's economic development. Australians may not know it but they owe a lot to Jim Carlton. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  For those of us on the Labor side of the House, when we think about South Australian politics so often we think about Don Dunstan, that great social reformer who brought South Australia out of the 1950s and 1960s with a splash of sartorial flair and with an openness to social reforms that reflected the social change of the 1960s. Don Dunstan was a unique political figure and the social reforms he put in place in South Australia presaged much of what the Whitlam government did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet often sitting in Dunstan's shadows is John Bannon, who did for the economic side of South Australia what Don Dunstan did for the social side. He was the longest-serving Labor Premier of South Australia, and during the entirety of his 10 years as Premier he also held the position of Treasurer—an extraordinary feat. Some of his more notable achievements in expanding the economic potential of South Australia include winning the Grand Prix for Adelaide, establishing Australia's submarine industry, developing the River Torrens bank as an events and tourism precinct, converting part of the Adelaide railway station into a convention centre and facilitating the establishment of the Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine in 1988—I should say after a not inconsiderable effort on John's part to change Labor Party policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those achievements meant that he was responsible for a substantial increase in the economic base of South Australia and for a significant rebound in its economy after the moribund economic situation it had been in in the early 1980s. He also recognised the importance of reducing the state's debt. But sadly, his important economic legacy was tarnished by the State Bank of South Australia crisis, something that would be indelibly associated with the Bannon government but events over which the Bannon government had little control. He again displayed the perseverance for which he was so well known. Despite knowing that it would damage his own political career, John Bannon acted with diligence and integrity during the host of inquiries which would eventually exonerate him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He might, as a Shakespeare enthusiast, have been tempted to languish in tragedy following his resignation, but instead he remained an enthusiastic, active and productive member of Australian society. He became a director of the ABC, completed a PhD in Australian political history at Flinders University, received an honorary doctorate in law and research and lectured as an academic. He contributed until the very last, briefing the Prime Minister on federalism and attending the Australia day-night cricket match at the new Adelaide Oval just days before his passing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a fellow political runner, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge John Bannon's extraordinary ability to combine marathon running with politics. He ran 28 Adelaide marathons, 11 of them in under three hours. I have got under three hours a couple of times but I will never get to John Bannon's pace. John's fastest marathon was two hours 44 minutes. That is a marathon pace which for part of the 20th century would have been the Australian record. He managed to maintain that personal discipline of getting out for a run whenever he could, and the grit and perseverance which is required to complete so many marathons at such a pace defined his political career. In a beautiful obituary in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span>, Mark Kenny wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Even now when I'm grinding out the kilometres in Canberra, I often rely on something John Bannon once confided about distance training. He said when your body wants to stop, you can always go a bit further, and you will be glad you made that choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a choice that John Bannon made in his running but also a choice that he made in his economic reforms. He always chose to go that extra kilometre, to put in that extra bit of effort. South Australia and Australia as a whole are better for his policy achievements, and all of us as parliamentarians can learn from his example of tenacity, effort and individual perseverance. I express my condolences to his family and acknowledge a fallen giant of Australian politics. John Bannon, rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="8W5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GRAY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I rise to speak on this statement in respect of the life of John Bannon, the Premier of South Australia, a personal friend, a long-term Labor staffer in the Whitlam government, President of the Labor Party and great force for political stability in my home state of South Australia. I first met John before the 1982 South Australian election, when he became Premier. I first met him at The Workers Club in Whyalla, where he was campaigning in favour of our new local candidate, Frank Blevins, who went on to become Deputy Premier of South Australia and one of that state's most significant treasurers in the terrible and difficult days following the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John was a deeply pragmatic man. He was thoughtful, caring and kind. He had a cheeky sense of humour and a voracious appetite for work. He led the debate at our national conference in 1982 to reform a substantial area of our party platform and then took that debate up again at the 1984 national conference here in Canberra, at what we then called the Lakeside Hotel, when the Labor Party adopted its three-mines uranium policy. John's speech at that conference centred on the importance of nuclear power, the role that South Australia could play in the nuclear cycle and, importantly, the damage done by acid rain in northern Europe and in northern America and the importance therefore of a technology-based energy-generation shift to deal with the climatic catastrophe that was being created by acid rain fallout. John engaged in that uranium debate with a fullness of spirit, an openness and a deep democratic belief that the party could make the hardest judgements in the best way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision in South Australia to progress Roxby Downs was a massive decision. The decision in South Australia by the Bannon government to support the development of Roxby Downs continues to have very important implications. The reality is that Roxby remains the heart of the economic growth opportunity for South Australia, producing copper, gold, silver and uranium. John Bannon was also Premier at the time of the approval of the Cooper Basin liquids project to pipe liquids from the Cooper Basin into the northern Spencer Gulf and then for those liquids to meet international markets. It was an insightful, difficult set of decisions inherited from a very capable former government and implemented with great skill by the Bannon government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The development of the Grand Prix in Adelaide brought to Adelaide a highly uncharacteristic sense of excitement and fizz. It took South Australia into a world that I do not believe South Australians had ever believed could be theirs, and that was a world of being popular, of being energetic and of having a bit of a difference about you. South Australia had become somewhat a bit staid and a bit stale, and the Bannon government gave it new life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The transition in the Labor Party from the deeply reformist and flamboyant leadership of Dunstan to the more cautious, careful and suited Bannon government was something that we all noted. On occasions, as much as Young Labor people like me adored Don Dunstan, the transition to Bannon was something that we watched carefully and thoughtfully. And Bannon becomes one of those significant economic leaders on the Labor side of politics balancing fairness and economic responsibility in an energetic way providing the foundation stone for a long-term government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bannon was also, of course, the chief of staff for Clyde Cameron, who was Whitlam's Labour minister. Bannon was on deck the day when Gough Whitlam sacked Clyde Cameron. I had cause to reflect late last year, with Bannon, on that event. Bannon did not tell me how sick he was, and indeed just on the eve of Christmas I received my annual Christmas card from John and Angela.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He wrote his Christmas cards even though he knew how deeply sick he was. He prioritised his friendships, his relationships and a simple gesture such as a Christmas card at that time becomes a towering gesture from a man who was saying goodbye to those of us who were important to him. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John continued to carry a major role nationally until his death. The Prime Minister remarked on that and, I think, at John's funeral the wonderful comments from Ian McLachlan on John's role in the South Australian Cricket Association and the formation of a sensible arrangement around the magnificent rebuild of the Adelaide Oval is something that should inform sports administrators in all states—cricket administrators, in particular—and the Australian Football League and the government of Western Australia in their consideration of the football stadium in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the really interesting things that Ian McLachlan said was that he had met with John in the days prior to John's death and that John had spoken to him about the nature of the funeral and the arrangements and the celebration of his life. John had requested that both his cricket bat and cricket ball be on the stage during the eulogies at the wake for the former Premier. Ian agreed that it was entirely appropriate that John's cricket ball should be on the stage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His cricket ball had been John's favoured weapon in cricket—although, as one would expect of John Bannon, he was not a fast bowler; he was a very good slow bowler and a highly successful slow bowler. Ian McLachlan, a former minister in the Howard government, made mention of the very spectacular bowling figures that John had continued to obtain as an experienced cricketer in the older leagues in South Australia. However, Ian was mystified by John's desire to have his cricket bat on the stage. Ian had gone back and done the calculations with the ball and realised that John's average at taking a wicket was extremely respectable—about a wicket every 17 runs. But, with the bat, John had scored—over the course of the previous 30 years—only two runs, on average, at each outing. Ian made the observation to John that he was not much of a batsman. John took umbrage at the fact that Ian had done the calculation and concluded that it wasn't two runs per innings that he had made with the bat; it was actually 2.05. I believe that correction should be on the record. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John was a terrific man—a man of humour, a man of passion, a man of great differences. He was a man who brought to my party a deep sense of obligation and a deep sense of accountability. When the State Bank of South Australia collapsed, John took it all on himself. It was not John's fault, but it was appropriate that the head of a government should act like a head of a government and take all of the accountabilities for the decisions that could be anchored back to that government. John was both very old-fashioned, proper and very principled but he did take it on himself to take more responsibility for those decisions than ever any head of government should have had to have done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John was a terrific man, a wonderful friend, an outstanding president of my party and an enduring Premier of South Australia, whose institutions will last and whose legacy to that state will be greatly appreciated for generations to come, if only because of the great decision that he made to ensure that Roxby Downs has a terrific future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I believe it is important in this place that we pause and take time to acknowledge those who have made a tremendous contribution to our nation and our political movement, and I firmly believe that Hon. Dr John Charles Bannon AO was one such man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was clear from an early age that John Bannon was going to make a significant contribution to public life. At university he was an active student, co-editor of the student university newspaper and president of the student's council as well as the Australian Union of Students. He plunged himself into student and university life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was, as the member for Brand has observed, an adviser during the tumultuous Whitlam years—he was the chief of staff to Whitlam minister Clyde Cameron. I had the opportunity of talking to Rodney Cavalier who, in a very Rodney way, had taken copious notes, only Hansard could be envious of, of John's funeral and wake on 21 December—I will have more to say about those notes and observations of Rodney during my contribution. Rodney observed, when I spoke to him earlier, that John was a committed Christian. However, he was never certain whether he loved Christ more than he loved cricket. He loved both of them with a deep, deep passion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He cut his teeth as an adviser during the Whitlam years and, no doubt, that influenced his approach to government when he received the honour of being elected the Premier of South Australia. At the end of the South Australian parliament in 1977, he was a cabinet member within just one year. Only four years after that, he had returned to Labor, Labor to government, as their leader. It was, in anyone's language, a meteoric rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He remains South Australia's longest-serving premier and his achievements profoundly and continue to affect the state that he loved so much. During his leadership, we saw the introduction of submarine building in South Australia, a legacy that Labor—state and federal—remains committed to preserving. As the Prime Minister and the member for Maribyrnong said yesterday: he was the father of the nation's submarine industry. His primary concern was always to build a solid economic base for the state of South Australia, because he understood that, with a strong economic base, it could provide economic opportunities for those who were not born with them. He focused heavily on economic development of the state, opening up new opportunities and new investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many years later, as a young man, I travelled throughout the country, including to South Australia, and worked at the grand prix, a fixture that was brought to Adelaide and truly put that international event and that city on the map. He saw the creation of the Adelaide Convention Centre and he established the Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine. He promoted the arts and tourism within those sectors and within South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Olympic Dam uranium mine, it probably may not be obvious to many of us today but, at the time, these were incredibly controversial issues, including incredibly controversial issues within the Australian Labor Party. I think, whichever side of the argument you were on—I happened to have been on a different side of the argument to John Bannon—everyone has to stand back and admire the way he managed the difficult politics, both internal and public politics, of that particular issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was all a part of his determination to make Adelaide a modern city that could lure international and national investments, and big events. His urban renewal projects reinvigorated Adelaide's inner suburbs and, under his reign, South Australia became, I think everyone would agree, more bolder, more interesting and innovative, more energetic and willing to seize opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He understood the state needed to diversify and become open to new ideas. The state is richer and the country is richer for his legacy. He was a strong and convincing leader, as the member for Brand has observed, and the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition observed in their eulogies yesterday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was, to both friends and critics, one of the most influential South Australian political figures of the post-Playford era. He never shied away from responsibility. After the collapse of the state bank—as the member for Brand has observed, he was not responsible for—he maintained, that as the Premier of the state, the buck stopped with him—even though others certainly played a more significant part in its crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His friend Michael Jacobs has said that he 'absorbed all the blame, all the shame and the humiliation, all the pain and the anguish of this catastrophe' that took so long for the state to recover from. Hardly anyone else put their hand up to admit their responsibility, but John never shied away from his public responsibility. He never complained about the injustice of it all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am indebted to Rodney Cavalier and his notes from the funeral and the wake. He writes of a very moving story that was relayed at the wake by a former minister in this place, Ian McLachlan, and a long-time friend of John Bannon and his family. And he wonders about whether the story of John's young brother Nicholas—who tragically died at the age of 16 during a family bushwalking catastrophe in the Flinders Ranges—was a motivating force for John's sense of responsibility, both public and private. Ian McLachlan was part of the search party that was looking for John's younger brother at the time. And he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We failed because we looked in the wrong places and we didn't look high enough. The search involved one of the largest deployments of volunteer and professional rescue staff that Australia has ever known.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a couple of years later before the remains of John's brother were found. Many people have retold this story. John himself did not talk about it—even to those who were closest to him—but many who knew John and knew the story often thought that this was a part of the motivating force that moved the man. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following his career in politics, John dived into the world of academia. He did not want to leave the state that he loved, and it is a sign of his dedication and humility that he opted to stay in South Australia and continue to contribute. He gained a PhD in political history at Flinders University where he studied his beloved state's transition from a colony to a state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He accepted an appointment to the ABC Board in 1994, which was his first foray into any form of office after his term as Premier. Following that, he was appointed by Ian McLachlan to the South Australian Cricket Association Board and the board of Cricket of Australia. He was active in this role until the end. He saw through a number of milestones in his final weeks that would have made him tremendously proud of his state. He was there to see the first Australian day-night test cricket at the new Adelaide Oval—a spectacle that South Australians were incredibly proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John's ongoing battle with illness did not prevent him from continuing to speak publicly. On 3 November—only weeks before he passed away—he addressed the 30-year anniversary lunch of Adelaide's first grand prix.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  It is a privilege to be able to speak on this condolence motion with respect to John Bannon. I knew John Bannon and I can well recall his ascendancy into politics in South Australia and ultimately becoming Premier. He was not only a good Premier, but he was a thoroughly decent man who, regrettably, will be remembered more so for the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia than for the many good deeds that he led South Australia through and, indeed, for the many good deeds he did for all Australians. Much has been said about John since his passing. Stories have been written in the media, words have been said in the parliament and at his funeral service. And, to some extent, through those words there has been some balance—and I believe some rightful justice—brought to the legacy that he left as a national leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;" />John Bannon won government back for Labor in 1982, after a bad election in 1979 when Don Dunstan stepped down and then handed the reins to Des Corcoran. I want to come back to that a bit later. But I want to talk about another aspect of the 1993 state election disaster for Labor. It was indeed a landslide election against Labor, with Labor losing some 12 seats at the time and Labor's vote dropping to, I think on a two-party preferred basis, less than 40 per cent. Indeed, given that at the previous election in 1989, Labor only secured 22 out of 47 seats and was governing with the assistance of two independents, it was always going to be a tough call for Labor to win the 1993 election. I would suggest that the additional fact of having been in office for 11 years would have contributed to that; it was much the case that, after 11 years, the community was inevitably calling for a change of government. But putting that to one side, the State Bank disaster was itself a tragedy, not just for John Bannon and the state government at the time but also, I believe, for South Australia for many years to come; and indeed, perhaps even for the nation. I will explain why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When John Bannon saw that the State Bank was in financial crisis, he took responsibility as Premier and as Treasurer. He said the buck stopped with him, and quite rightly not only took responsibility; he was prepared to stand down as Premier of South Australia.—that in itself showed the integrity of the man. But it went further than that: he then subsequently stepped down as the member for Ross Smith, the seat he had held since 1977. So the State Bank issue ended John Bannon's political career. He was only 50 years of age at the time, and certainly had a lot more that he could have contributed to the state, had he remained in politics. The next step was that, stepping down as leader, he handed over the leadership to Lynn Arnold, who was another thoroughly decent South Australian. He was a great orator, he was an honest parliamentarian, and he had outstanding political talent. Lynn accepted the leadership, in my view, knowing full well that he could not win the 1993 election, but in the hope that through his leadership he would contain the losses of the South Australian Labor Party. I suspect he knew that if he lost the 1993 election it could also spell the end of his political career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1993 election was a disaster for Labor. It lost the election. It lost badly, and Lynn Arnold did step down as Premier, and ultimately resigned his seat in parliament as well. So the State Bank affair not only cost John Bannon his political leadership in South Australia but it also cost us Lynn Arnold, who in my view was an equally competent leader that never ever got the opportunity to serve out a term as Premier and to deliver what I think he could have delivered for South Australia. I knew Lynn very well, and so I can speak about him very much from my own knowledge of his personal characteristics. I know that Lynn would have also made a great South Australian premier, had he been given a better opportunity to lead the people of South Australia. Lynn indeed went on to serve this country and South Australia. He took up an international regional leadership role with World Vision straight afterwards, and then came back to South Australia and for years was chief executive at Anglicare SA where, again, he did a terrific job, particularly in the social justice area. Finally, he studied theology and now serves as a minister of religion with the Anglican Church. In fact, he participated in the funeral service for John Bannon at St Peter's Cathedral. And so Lynn did continue to serve South Australia, but in a different capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another aspect to the State Bank disaster about which little has been said. It not only cost South Australia two great statesmen, but it also changed public policy in South Australia—public policy changes that still resonate today and are still relevant. What we saw was that the State Bank disaster caused governments to get out of government-owned banking in this country. That in turn left the banking sector to the private banks. Since that happened, we have seen that private bank profits have skyrocketed. Indeed, the Commonwealth Bank, which was sold a few years later as well—in the late nineties or at some stage in the nineties—from memory was sold for around $8 billion. The bank makes about $8 billion or more now each year. In other words, the bank was sold for about a year's profit in today's terms. But there were other assets sold. The point I make about that is that the government banks, in my view, were the best form of regulation in the marketplace. They controlled the excessive greed of today's big banks. Right now, there is a bill before parliament that we are debating about credit card fees—most credit cards being owned by the banks—where people are being gouged. That was not happening when government banks were also in the marketplace, because they acted as the honest broker in the market. And yes, they had to compete with the private banks; they did not have a monopoly. But they acted as the honest broker. That has all been lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw a whole range of other government utilities and assets being sold and privatised. It became a public policy trend. Those who pointed to governments being in the business of managing assets that were in themselves business assets argued that the governments had no place in the marketplace in managing those assets, and that governments were poor business managers. That argument has never been truly sustained. In South Australia, I know that when those who argued that governments were poor business managers were doing so, they were simultaneously eyeing off the very assets that they wanted the government to sell so that they could get their own hands on them. Assets like the electricity assets in South Australia, SA water, the Lotteries Commission, TAB, and so many others, were all sold off—all assets that were actually returning money to the government and to the people of South Australia. The same applied across the border in other states and at the national level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the State Bank collapse gave rise, momentum and argument to all those people who would argue that governments should be selling off business assets that they did not need to be in control of. The sale of those assets was, in my view, short-term gain for long-term pain. Today, state and federal governments are cash-strapped, and I believe that is partly because their previous revenue-raising streams have all been sold off. Imagine what the federal government's position would be today, if the billions of dollars that the Commonwealth Bank is making were going into Treasury instead. It would make a huge difference. But none of those assets are owned by governments any more, and so the very revenue streams that kept many of the state governments afloat in years gone by have now been lost. I believe that that is a contributing factor to the difficulties that state governments all find themselves in right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the State Bank stuck to its core business of housing lending, it actually did very well. It was only when the board members pushed the bank into risky commercial ventures that the bank got into difficulties. And that fallout continued—as we saw at the heart of the global financial crisis, when the Rudd government wanted to establish a building and construction bank. We heard the howls of another State Bank disaster coming loud and clear from coalition members opposite. The other point I want to make about the State Bank disaster is this: the State Bank was being overseen by a board of directors. On that board were people who had been appointed because of their so-called business expertise and experience. Those very people were, in my view, the ones that pushed the bank into the risky commercial ventures that ultimately got the bank into trouble. Yet those same board members seem to have slipped out of the limelight scot-free. In other words, we entrusted the management of the bank to a board; on the board there were people with the so-called commercial experience; and they were the ones who let us down. And yet nothing was ever said about them. John Bannon wore it all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for those reasons that the John Bannon story is about more than just his contribution to South Australia—and perhaps to the nation—as a premier. His contribution, and what happened with the State Bank issue, had ramifications which extended right across the country and which still affect us today. I come back to John Bannon's own personal legacy. John was elected in 1977 for the seat of Ross Smith. It was a relatively safe seat in the inner northern suburbs—</span>

                  </a>  I will wrap up; thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. John Bannon became opposition leader in 1979, Premier and Treasurer in 1982, and then became South Australia's longest-serving premier. His most notable achievements were the Olympic Dam; the submarine project, which others have talked about; the Adelaide Convention Centre; the Adelaide Casino development; and the Formula One. He was indeed a person who shaped and changed South Australia. He was farewelled on 21 December at Saint Peter's Cathedral in a very fitting farewell service, and I pay my condolences to his family and friends.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I rise to support the comments of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and everyone who will now make a contribution to this important reflection on the natural disasters we have suffered in this country in recent months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I want to focus on my own region, the Hunter. But before I do, I want to acknowledge the other unfortunate and tragic events reflected on by the leaders. There were, of course, the fires in Western Australia, particularly in Yarloop where we had what I would describe almost as a Hollywood-style event, where a whole town was effectively wiped off the map. It was just so tragic. It is very hard to believe. And, unless you were part of that event, I do not think any of us could possibly hope to fully understand the impact on that community. There were also the fires around the Great Ocean Road region, and the floods in the Northern Territory—all are tragic events at arguably the worst time of the year, when people are seeking a break and hoping to have a holiday. But wherever the event, there is one constant, and that is the work, the skill, the courage and the dedication of our emergency services personnel, both those who are paid but also more particularly, in many senses, the unpaid—those who volunteered; those who give up their time. They are simply amazing, leaving their families, often on Christmas Day, more often than not during a period when they are trying to take a holiday from their work. They do that to risk their lives, in the cold or the heat, in an attempt to assist others who are in trouble. I do not think that any of us can speak too highly of those who are doing that important and dangerous work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I pay particular tribute to Paul Sanderson. He was a volunteer firefighter from my own electorate who gave his life in November last year fighting a fire in the searing heat. At 48 years of age, he suffered a fatal heart attack. It is a sad and tragic loss. I suspect that almost every member of this place would have a similar story, given the sheer number of volunteers we have out there on a regular basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own region, the storms—the cyclonic event—that we suffered over the course of the Christmas period came very soon after the devastating April floods and storms of last year. I have heard anecdotes of people who were only just finally coming around to replacing the carpet in their home or in their small business, only to have it ruined again by the storms which took place over the break. So this is particularly devastating for those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The April storms took the lives of three people—not all of them, but some in the electorate of the member for Paterson and one, certainly, in my own electorate. The community of Gillieston Heights in my electorate, for example, was cut off from the rest of the community for days on end. I pay tribute both to the residents of Gillieston Heights and all those who came to their assistance—who volunteered their fishing boats et cetera to get food and supplies onto what the stoic residents came to call 'Gillieston Island' rather than Gillieston Heights, which was both funny and reflective of the courage of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time for the state government to do something about the access to Gillieston Heights. I went to school in Maitland, travelling from my home town of Cessnock, and the school bus was cut off regularly at Testers Hollow, the roadway through just before Gillieston Heights. We were unable to get to school. I am now 54 years of age, so that was a little while ago, and in heavy rains and floods the access to Gillieston Heights is still being blocked by floods. We are in the 21st century and it is time the state government became very serious about making sure that is not the case and that the residents of Gillieston Heights—I almost said 'Gillieston Island' again!—are not stranded in the way they were during the April storms and again recently. They were not landlocked this time, because it was only blocked off on one side this time, but they were in April. They should never have to experience that again in this modern world. Where we have all the wit in the world, we should be able to address that problem, and money should not be a barrier to such an important project. It does not have to be the lifting of the road; there might be other solutions—for example, a different route for the road. I have heard some alternatives, but whatever it is it should be done and it should be done quickly. Indeed, all three levels of government should be working together to make sure that is the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to touch quickly on an area called South Cessnock in my home town. I am going to go back to my youth again. I remember when I was on Cessnock City Council, wading through water that was waist-deep in South Cessnock, helping local residents sandbag to protect their homes from the flood. South Cessnock is still flooding. In heavy rains it floods. I am not too critical of the council; I know it has a strategy or plan that is working on the issue. But I think South Cessnock residents, many of whom were there all those years ago and well before I was wading through the water, deserve to have that problem addressed. They have had water through their homes on too many occasions, and surely in the 21st century we have both the finances and the wit to do something about that problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These events are a reminder that we cannot control the weather. We cannot control Mother Nature. Mother Nature is far more powerful than any technology we have, including nuclear capacity. When the volcano goes off or the winds or the high seas come—the tsunami—and wipes an island continent out, there is nothing human beings can do. We need to take care of our environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have never been described as a rabid environmentalist. I prefer to describe myself as a conservationist and a person who believes that we do have to take more care of our environment. If there is any suggestion that the endeavours of the human kind are causing our weather patterns to become more erratic and less predictable, we should be doing something about it and taking any measure as a precautionary principle to make sure that we are, as best we can, as a human race protecting ourselves because, again, when Mother Nature speaks we do not have the answers. We can go out and help as best we can and protect ourselves as best we can, but we cannot protect ourselves from the most erratic weather events. So we should be taking a public policy approach that reassures people that, as best we can, we are making sure that the activities of the human race are not making those events more likely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and I am pleased that they put this motion forward. It is important to those who have been affected by weather events. Certainly, from my perspective, it is a very, very important opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have helped in the recent events and those before them and no doubt will do so in the future, giving up their time and risking their lives to help others in need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  It is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak on this motion and to support the wonderful words of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Like the member for Hunter, I acknowledge the other natural disasters in Western Australia, in the Northern Territory and in the Hunter that have occurred over the summer, but in this contribution I want to speak about the terrible bushfire that occurred in Wye River and Separation Creek on Christmas Day 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For anyone who has not visited, this is a magical part of the world; two tiny settlements on the Great Ocean Road nestled between this magnificent iconic coastline and the Great Otway National Park. As a child I camped in the local caravan park with my family every Easter. The two caravan parks, the Wye River general store, the pub and the surf lifesaving club were and remain the lifeblood of this community. Through sheer bravery, good planning and determination all of these community assets were saved on Christmas Day. Through an incredible miracle, I think it is fair to say, there was no loss of live and no serious injuries. But within a matter of hours the ferocity of this fire had taken 116 homes. Many were holiday homes that had been in families for generations. Around a dozen permanent residents lost their homes. This included three members of the Wye River CFA—people like Tony and Lesley Maly, who lost everything except their beloved cat Muppet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Wye River and Separation Creek as they embark on the long and painful rebuilding process after the terrible Christmas Day bushfire. Within a matter of days, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy joined me to visit this community and see first-hand the devastation. It was an incredibly important opportunity to say thank you and to commend this community for its bravery, its resilience and its positivity in the face of such adversity. It was an opportunity to thank members of the Wye River CFA, led by captain Roy Moriarty, who have become real local heroes; to thank the many other firefighters and emergency workers, including CFA volunteers from right across south west Victoria; to thank the community members who worked around the clock from the surf club to provide vital support—food, water, emergency shelter; and to thank the many people now involved in the recovery phase, including the difficult task of rebuilding those homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some very significant challenges in an area of such high fire risk and with the sort of topography that makes Wye River and Separation Creek so unique: land stability, water quality, the cost of rebuilding in such steep terrain and the damage done to local business during the most important two weeks of the year when the town would ordinarily be swamped with tourists. Let's not forget, the town was closed to the public for about a week with the Great Ocean Road closed as well. It has been very, very tough for local businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth, of course, is very pleased to be providing vital support as this community begins the difficult and painful journey to rebuild and recover. Under longstanding cost-sharing arrangements, the Natural Disaster Relief And Recovery Arrangements, the Commonwealth and the Victorian governments have activated a range of assistance to support affected communities including: personal hardship and distress assistance to help meet immediate needs; repairing damaged homes; providing counselling support; assistance for the demolition and clean-up of residential properties, including the disposal of debris, asbestos and contaminated material from destroyed homes—asbestos is a very big issue—and financial assistance for local and state authorities to restore damaged public infrastructure and undertake disaster recovery operations. The support is extensive. The Victorian government has also announced it will establish a one-stop shop to assist with rebuilding and planning, which is so important, and funding for water infrastructure and marketing to boost tourism. There is a $1 million Economic and Community Recovery Fund which will go towards locally driven recovery priorities to support local businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to say that with the support of the Minister for Communications, the Commonwealth also was able to assist the Falls Festival which is normally based in the outskirts of Lorne. It is a wonderful event for our region and is very important for the local economy. Due to the evacuation of not only Wye River and Separation Creek but also of Lorne, the festival had to be relocated. We are very, very proud to have supported that important festival. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been an incredible effort from the Spirit Foundation which has raised a very considerable amount of money to support the community as it recovers. I am concerned that only one permanent resident has been able to access the larger $32,500 grant and I have raised this with the Victorian Government, which administers the scheme, and I am hopeful that this particular matter can be resolved. What is also clear from this natural disaster is the importance that fire sirens played in Wye River and Lorne where they are being trialled. They were activated and generally the feedback is that they worked extremely well. It is very disappointing that the Victorian government has not allocated the $3 million in its budget. The request to provide fire sirens all along the Great Ocean Road, where they are desperately needed, was refused last year—places like Anglesea, Aireys Inlet, Fairhaven and Moggs Creek, where the memories of Ash Wednesday still run very, very deep. I do hope that this matter can be urgently remedied. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other issues of course. As the local federal MP for this area there is no doubt that Wye River and Separation Creek will need much more ongoing support. I am focused on how our government can deliver better communications. Improved mobile reception is one particular need in this community as well as the expedited rollout of the NBN .The NBN has been rolled out to some 70,000 premises across Corangamite but Wye and Sep Creek are currently not on the rollout plan, so I am hoping that that can be remedied as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great commitments we have made—unfortunately, a commitment not shared by federal Labor—was $50 million towards an upgrade of the Great Ocean Road, in partnership with the state, announced by the previous Liberal state government. This has been received incredibly positively. We are also allocating some $4 million to upgrade the Separation Creek bridge in this community—which is wonderful—but there is no doubt that on such an iconic road, on such a challenging geographical road, more investment is required. Even in places like Kennett River and at the Mobbs Creek arch, we need some basic tourism infrastructure, such as toilet blocks, to make the tourist experience much more significant, better signage and better investment in this road because this is the centrepiece of a $2.1 billion local economy in terms of what it contributes to the tourism economy as an incredibly important tourism asset not just at a national level but also at an international level. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do need to acknowledge that every year many Corangamite residents face the threat of bushfire. We have been very proud of the mobile base stations that we have rolled out, because mobile communications during any emergency are so incredibly important. We have announced mobile base stations for Gellibrand, Carlisle River, Kawarren and Dereel—all areas of high fire risk. I am hoping that Telstra will prioritise these areas as well as look at other vital areas that need communications along the Great Ocean Road in places like Aireys, Bellbrae and Anglesea. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many issues facing these communities at this very difficult time—both immediate issues and, of course, some of the longer term issues that I have referred to in relation to bushfire mitigation and better management when such a terrible emergency occurs. I join with the Wye River and Separation Creek communities in saying it is an incredible feat of bravery that we have seen. There is incredible resilience. There is incredible determination from this community to get back on its feet, and I will be there with the community doing whatever I can, proudly, as its local member.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McGOWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  As another Victorian, Member for Corangamite, I acknowledge and support your words, and particularly your words about telecommunications. The story I want to tell the House today is very similar to the member for Corangamite's. It is a tribute to community and to volunteers backed by very effective government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My story began the week before Christmas, on a Sunday. We had heard it was going to be a really hot day. We knew it was going to be bad, and it was. It was around lunchtime when the word got out that the fire had begun at Barnawartha. Heading south down the Indigo Valley, it jumped the Hume Highway and it burnt—a really intensive wildfire. I am going to spare the details, except to say that about six hours later it rained. That rain, combined with the support, stopped the fire about 10 kays short of Wodonga, the major city in my electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is what happened afterwards that I want to place on record in this House today. I want to talk about the work of the CFA—District 24, Paul King and all your team; districts 23 and 22; and the over 70 fire brigades that turned up to support us in Indigo Valley. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the New South Wales Rural Fire Service and their fire rescue—crossing the border, coming over and doing that excellent work up at the gap. Not only did you come on the day but you stayed and stayed, and then, three weeks later, when the fire came out of that log—again very close to Wodonga—you were there and you stopped it at the top of the Leneva valley. That was hard, hard work on very rugged country. I want to acknowledge the airborne wing—the magic of your work with those helicopters swooping to pick up the water out of the dam, the siren going, and stopping that fire. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge all the private providers who provided slip-ons, and the many individuals who turned up; the Red Cross people who staffed the emergency relief centre in Wodonga; and the local hoteliers who provided accommodation for the families that were evacuated. Thank you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the incident control centre and Graham Healy. Congratulations, Graham, on your Fire Service Medal in the Australia Day Honours. I want to acknowledge all the agencies who gathered regularly at that incident control centre to go through what had happened and what needed to happen as we looked at the images coming back from the helicopters and we tried to work out what we needed to do next. Those regular meetings keeping all the agencies in contact made a huge difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the Victorian government. Today I would like to pay particular attention to the Premier, Daniel Andrews, for coming the day after and spending that whole day with us—touring the Indigo Valley, seeing what happened and talking to the farmers—and to the Minister for Emergency Services, Jane Garrett, for touring the valley and making sure that all the arrangements were in order. They were there when we needed them. They came and they listened. They heard the stories of Coyle sheep. They heard the stories of the four houses that were burnt at Masons Gap and the 39 houses that were not burnt. They heard that no serious injuries occurred, and how that policy of protecting assets and keeping people safe is really working. The local member of parliament for Benambra, Bill Tilley, was constantly a presence, making sure the issues were heard and things were addressed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Christine Ferguson, a regional director with the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, and all her staff—particularly for being with us on Christmas Day. We know you had other things which you could have been doing; the fact that you chose to come and share it with us was really appreciated. I want to acknowledge the commitment of local government—Gerry Smith at Indigo Shire Council, Patience Harrington at Wodonga Council and all your staff—to being there, to doing what needed to be done and to still being there in the weeks afterwards, particularly Gerry and your staff. I want to acknowledge the ABC as our emergency broadcaster, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Border Mail</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> North East Newspapers, Prime7 television and WIN Television. Never ever have I felt so strongly the need for really strong local and regional media: you did such a fantastic job on the day and the days afterwards. Thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, the unique experience this time was that it was my valley—my community—that burned. It was my community that then came in to do what needed to be done. They came to help me and my family and the other hundreds of families that got burnt. Our houses were okay; sure—but our fences had burned, our water pipes had burned, our stock were burned, our sheds were burned, and our gardens were burned. I watched and experienced as my community and neighbours gathered, first on the scene to help with gathering the stock and sorting out the injured from the uninjured, then people who turned up with food: large plates of lasagne—never have I welcomed such food coming from other people!—and the cakes and slices. And then people got underway with the working bees, helping with the house water and with the stock water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Middle Indigo Primary School and Tammy Zuber who opened up the school during the holidays—and I have to say that Indigo Valley has two community institutions: we have the fire shed and we have the school. Tammy opening the school and keeping it open for weeks provided a public place for people to gather. And, together with Rachael Proctor and the parents of the Middle Indigo School, Tammy offered child care so that there was a safe place for the kids when their parents were out working, a place for food to go, and for people to meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge BlazeAid, who came and set up at the Barnawartha sportsground. For the past month, they have gone out in teams of five to all of our farms. They have helped with that heartbreaking work of pulling up the fences and the pipes, and dismantling the sheds. They have come and they have listened and listened, and provided such practical support. And then, once a week, they invite us farmers down to the Barnawartha sportsground so that we can go and socialise and get to know them. There is a whole new community that has grown up; a national community really. We have had people from the Gold Coast, from Adelaide, from the Mornington Peninsula and of course from our local Albury-Wodonga, who have come out on their days off, joined these local teams, got their overalls on, and up the valley they have gone—and have been such amazing support. I want to acknowledge the Belvoir Rotary Club who have come out and offered us a barbecue—great!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would now like to thank some very special individuals and name some of them, at the risk of embarrassing them. I acknowledge Bob from Londrigan. It was Christmas time, and Bob arranged for some hams to be delivered up our valley. We have since found out that over $10,000 of hams got delivered—to every single home, and to the CFA. It was such a beautiful thing to be able to sit down there and eat this really tasty ham and know that people were thinking of us. To Katrina and Glen, our local Australia Post people, thank you for what you did—checking in with everybody, keeping an eye on us. I acknowledge the CFA leadership team, Tim and Trish Hibberson, who did a fantastic job—Tim as captain, Trish as communications person—making sure that people knew what they needed to know. To Dave McDonald and all the team, thank you very much. To Jenny Clark and Donna Cross: I think words will never describe the energy, persistence and resilience that you put in being at that fire shed, feeding all the firefighters as they came through, keeping a smile up, getting the rosters in place, and making sure that there was someone there all the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I would like to talk a little bit about some of the learnings from this experience, and to acknowledge the old guys in the Indigo Valley and Barnawartha, like Joe Baynes and Gordon Poulley, who take me aside and say, 'Cathy, we know about fires. We were here in 1939, we were here in 1952, and you know about 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2015. There is nothing new for our rural communities in this experience of fire, yet every time it seems to take us with such a shock.' So there needs to be some way that we can take the learnings of this and incorporate it into our culture. Summer comes; fires come. We know the devastation, but we also know what needs to be done. In my community, we have learnt the lessons of Kinglake, Marysville, and Murrindindi. We have really good communication systems. The incident control centre worked well. But I really want to pick up on the words of the member for Corangamite on the absolute need for mobile phones and the NBN. Where it worked, it was great. But where we had those black spots, the community really suffered. We rely so much now on going onto the broadband to getting our information—but if you have no access, or if your mobile phone does not work, all that sort of infrastructure just leaves us behind. So this is a huge cry out to the Victorian government to continue to support the Commonwealth government mobile phone black spot program and help us invest in those fire prone areas, which Telstra and the other telcos are never going to be able to do by themselves.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to bring my words to a close. It is one of those times in my life where I have felt so proud to be part of a community that is connected, a community that works, a community that is actually networked not only during the fire but also during the support afterwards, and days later when we still gather and share our stories. That sense of belonging to a community and representing a community is so strong. So to the people of Barnawartha, Indigo Valley, Yackandandah, Wooragee, Wodonga and the surrounding areas: just a heartfelt thank you for being there for us and to say that we will absolutely be there for you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="212585" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUTCHINSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I join with the comments of the member for Indi. I also note the presence of the member for Forrest and the contributions that were made by the member for Corangamite and the member for Hunter—all of whom have had communities impacted by natural disasters, something that is part of our nation's make-up. It is what we are this summer: a land of drought, flooding rains and fires. It gives me great pleasure to make a contribution on behalf of the communities in my electorate of Lyons that were impacted over the last month by both fire and flood, and join with the comments yesterday of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to that end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation in Tasmania that we found ourselves in during January, when the fires were at their peak, was really a result of what was an extraordinarily dry spring time. In some parts of the state it was the driest October on record and a pretty ordinary September. A below average rainfall in November and December was the precursor to the higher risk of fire—and, indeed, fire there was. Daily temperatures through that spring time period also compounded the problem. Rainfall, as I said, was lower. Some parts of the state had record temperatures, but certainly some parts of the state had record low rainfalls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course that presents real challenges not only for farmers around my electorate but also for members of more urban communities, particularly in relation to the water restrictions that have been brought in over the last month or so. And it is not over yet. There has been a record number of total fire ban days across the state of Tasmania and hundreds of fires have burnt across the state. Many of you would have seen the impacts of the fires on the west coast—not in my electorate, but in my colleague the member for Braddon's electorate—which are burning in areas that are very sparsely populated, which is a blessing; however, I note the evacuations that were made in those parts of the west coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The communities that were most impacted by the fires in my electorate included the Derwent Valley, up towards Maydena and the national park, into the municipality of Kentish. I note the community of Lorinna have had an ongoing issue with access. There is only one road that is currently able to be used to go in and out of that very small community in a beautiful part of the world, and certainly it has understandably highlighted the concerns that they were presented with in terms of being able to access an alternative route out of the township of Lorinna. The Meander Valley, particularly the communities of Mole Creek and Chudleigh, were severely impacted. The fires that started around Lake Mackenzie were a threat to a number of communities around Meander, Western Creek, Chudleigh, Mole Creek and Jackeys Marsh. They also went into reserve areas and part of the national park and world heritage areas that abut those communities. There are still 75 fires active around the state, including 46 that are currently still uncontained or uncontrolled. To date, more than 100,000 hectares have been burnt and 37 fires have yet to be mapped. They have a perimeter of around 830 kilometres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been blessed though with support from interstate—New South Wales and Victoria in particular—in terms of remote area specialists. In fact, 180 people have come to the state. So we have had a combination of personnel from New Zealand, from New South Wales, the ACT. Of course, there are also staff from the Parks and Wildlife Service in Tasmania, Forestry Tasmania and the wonderful staff at the Tasmanian Fire Service, along with the volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the member for Indi's comments about communication. This has already been raised with me, particularly in relation to the community at Mole Creek. It is great to know that they were funded in the first round of the $100 million mobile phone blackspot program. While they have not got communication currently, that will be something that hopefully will happen in years to come. The SES has been extraordinary in their ability to communicate with often quite isolated communities, as have the ABC. I take my hat off to the ABC; they have done a fantastic job again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An estimated 11,000 hectares of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area has been burnt. I just want to clarify a few points, because there has been a lot of media—there has been national media, and I note that Senator McKim has made some comments about this; there was an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> yesterday by Professor Jamie Kirkpatrick. They are over-egging the omelette there. It is a disaster, it is a tragedy and certainly some of that very fragile and precious alpine vegetation has been impacted, but it is a very small part of what is an enormous area in the state of Tasmania. Less than two per cent of the Wilderness World Heritage Area has been impacted. It is absolutely typical that they overreach, they over exaggerate the reality of this. Of course it is a tragedy to see those vulnerable trees that are less able to regenerate compared to eucalypt forests, but it is disingenuous to say that the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area has been devastated, because it simply has not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to my contribution, I certainly made Minister Hunt aware when it became apparent that these areas were under threat. I have spoken to Minister Keenan on numerous occasions over the last few months, as I have with the Tasmanian Fire Service. My message to them was that if, through the normal processes of seeking assistance when it is appropriate from the Commonwealth, you have an issue, then come to your local member. That has not been the case, fortunately, and they have been in control of the situation there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an irony here, of course, that those communities that were threatened, particularly the community of Meander and around that area—I note that the member for Watson now owns a property adjacent to the extensions that he, when he was the minister for the environment, extended under his watch. He is now the proud owner of a property in an area that, as a result of his decisions, has been added to the Wilderness World Heritage Area. It was not those communities of Jackeys Marsh, of which he is now part; it was the people in Meander and Western Creek and other areas that had, for generations, made a livelihood off the western tiers. Through their mismanagement, if you will, as would be claimed by some, these areas were considered appropriate for inclusion within the World Heritage Area. There is an irony here that should not be lost on anybody about the inconsistency and the hypocrisy that exist here. It is wonderful to have the member for Watson with a property in my electorate. I am very pleased to have him, and certainly, if there are issues, I will do my best to represent his concerns. I am not sure that some of his neighbours would feel the same pleasure at having him is a neighbour though, given the work and the damage he did during the time he was the minister for the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left, I would just say that on the east coast the rain has come during the last week and a half has caused huge damage to some parts of the east coast and in the north-east. There have been record daily rainfalls on any day of the year—not just with January rainfalls at Orford, Frankfurt in the Latrobe municipality, Friendly Beaches, on the east coast. The township of Meander, with a blessing, had their highest daily rainfall of 91.8 millimetres on 29 January, as parts of the north-west did, albeit that the west coast, which was in desperate need, missed out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nature is indeed a powerful beast. It is also very resilient, and we should not lose sight of the fact that, like nature, rural and regional committees are also very resilient. I was at a Fingal and St Marys to view the damage that was caused by floods there on Saturday afternoon and to view the work that the volunteers that participated and the SES did—and the stoicism of the locals. The local council—I will give credit to them; it was just wonderful to see. These communities will recover and, again, this is again part of the country that we live in. I take my hat off to all those people that have contributed to the recovery process. Thank you for the opportunity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HW9" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHAMPION</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  It is almost without exception that this chamber echoes with, I think, a common purpose and goodwill. Of course all Australians have watched their television sets over the summer and seen the terrible fires and floods that have occurred in Western Australia, Victoria, the Territory, the Hunter Valley and Tasmania and have watched with a great deal of concern and consideration to all those affected. For me, 2015 started with bushfires at Sampson Flat and it ended with bushfires in Pinery and the Adelaide Plains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it was Ms McGowan who said that it is different when the community affected is the one that you grew up in, the one that you live in and the one where you know people. That gives every fire and every flood a greater resonance, and so there is a common bond between Australians but it is made deeper through our experience of and vulnerability to natural disasters such as flood and fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The communities affected, particularly by the Pinery fire, a place that very few people had heard about, included Mallala, Owen, Balaklava, Templers, Wasleys, Hamley Bridge, Freeling, Pinkerton Plains, Greenock, Daveyston, Kapunda and Tarlee—these are all communities that I know very well. I grew up in Kapunda. I currently live close by to Greenock. I can see the fire scar from my front yard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These were devastating fires and they had a devastating effect on all of those communities, but particularly on those who have lost loved ones. I would like to offer my condolences to the Tiller family and to the family of Janet Hughes. They have suffered very devastating losses, and it is very humbling to meet those who are mourning for loved ones. I have met Jennifer Tiller. I know I have felt very deeply her loss, and it is a loss that stays with them every hour of every day. It is very difficult to deal with the loss of such a respected person and such a loved family man. I would like to extend my condolences to their friends, their families and the communities that they lived in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With these recent disasters, we must be reminded that it does not just stop once a fire has swept through. Residents have to deal every day with the consequences of the damage to stock, fencing and soil. In my own electorate we have had massive dust storms over the summer—a constant reminder of the devastation—cleaning up after every one of these dust storms. We know that recovery is so much more. It is an emotional journey but it is also a practical journey, dealing with insurance assessors and arguing out each item sometimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was speaking to one of my neighbours in this building earlier today, in Aussies; he was having a bit of an argument with the insurer over a rainwater tank. Fortunately, the insurer did the right thing but constantly having to go through that process is enormously difficult for people. I know one farmer who left a very expensive truck off the list of items to be insured—a simple administrative error that normally would not have been an issue. Of course the insurer has done the right thing, but it is a moment of worry—a $60,000 truck—and I am sure he will not be the only farmer with a long list of assets that the insurer has to go through. It is a difficult process. It is a laborious process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the real issues of the Pinery fire was that the devastation was such that the stubble had burnt the loam out of the soil—and in many areas there was just dust left on the side of the road and in paddocks. Farmers have had to resurrect technologies that they had thought had passed by them by—they have had to get ploughs. Some of the young farmers had never used discs—I am showing my ignorance, I suppose—and they had to remind themselves of those processes, reacquaint themselves, and re-equip themselves with all of those reasonably old technologies. Recently we have had big rains in South Australia, and you have never heard farmers say this before but they are hoping weeds will grow to hold the soil down. I guess there are a whole lot of land use questions that come out of these devastating fires. I know there are many farmers who are thinking about land use in the future, particularly the use of fire breaks and the like. Of course there is an efficiency trade-off there, but I think that we are becoming more and more aware of the fire risks in these areas, particularly around harvest time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the demolition of buildings, and I heard other members talking about the perils of asbestos used in houses, with higher demolition costs, and of course there are all of the disposal issues that come with the destruction of houses. It is not just asbestos—asbestos is a serious issue—but also in South Australia we have had farmers wanting to dispose of rubble and they have had to crush it to a certain size and bury it in certain places. There is a whole lot of regulatory interaction with the EPA, and sometimes just agents of the EPA, and that can be very frustrating, as dealing with any bureaucracy is, but getting that information out and having the practical application of that information is very important. We need all of our regulators, I guess, to be cognisant of the emotional journey that those affected are having. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are utilities—not just mobile phone towers, although mobile phone towers are very important and the collapse of mobile phone towers in my electorate was a serious issue. Often people only got messages hours after the event and the problem with this is a late message can be more dangerous than not getting the message at all. So many people got evacuation messages when it was actually dangerous to evacuate. I think we have to look at not just making sure that that infrastructure is up, but if people do get a message it has to be timely. If it arrives late it can be more dangerous because one of the things that came out of the Pinery fires is that it is terribly dangerous to be on the road. People are probably safer within a town than out on the road, but of course people have to have their bushfire plans. Owen had a bushfire plan and activated it, and it worked very well not just in protecting people but also in giving people a sense of confidence. Confidence, and being calm in what is an extremely devastating and terrifying situation, having some order, is terribly important. So we do need to learn the lessons of all of these fires, and their impact on communications, and remind people to have a battery-powered radio—at the very least a battery-powered radio is very, very important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the devastating fires in my electorate I did make some comments about the need, I think a desperate need, for a national water bombing fleet. We have now state governments who are doing the right thing and leasing water bombing aircraft, and we know that many of these aircraft are working in both Australia and the United States. They are leased aircraft. I think we have to have a very close look at a national fleet because these aircraft do make a massive difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have to have national coverage because, as we have learnt from Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia, it took some hours to get those planes to South Australia. They flew over my neighbour's house, so I know how effective they are at protecting towns. I think it is a matter that the national government has to have consideration for. I am not saying that as a partisan thing, but I think—and I know the member for Ballarat also has some expertise and knowledge in this area—this is something we should work out as a bipartisan national project and it would go some way towards responding to these terrible and devastating fires and floods that affected our nation over the summer.</span>

On January 6, a lightning strike in Dwellingup's Lane Poole Reserve jarrah forest at the back of Waroona around 7.30 in the morning recreated that challenge. It was a fire that took 17 days to extinguish. It had a 243-kilometre perimeter and burnt over 72,000 hectares around Waroona, Yarloop, Preston Beach, Cookernup and Harvey. Of course, there were so many homes lost in Yarloop, as we have all seen. Over 172 properties in different ways were affected. We have seen bridges lost, power lost and at least 800 kilometres of fencing destroyed as well as cattle losses, pasture, hay, seed and all of that. It claimed the lives of Malcolm Taylor and Leslie 'Squizzy' Taylor in Yarloop. I offer my sincere condolences to their family, their friends and the Yarloop community who all feel their loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On January 6, I was home at our dairy farm in Harvey. We could see the fire coming—the massive pools of smoke—and were following the DFES alerts and warnings very closely. It was fuelled by very strong winds on Wednesday night—so strong that it woke us up throughout the night. On Thursday morning our paddocks and lawns were covered in ash and embers, and we could see the fires burning on several fronts. There were evacuations from each of the affected communities. On Thursday night we could see Yarloop actually burning—the glow in the sky was intense. We were keeping in close touch with people in the nearby Cookernup community. They could actually hear the gas bottles going off one after the other as Yarloop burned.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fires then raced towards Preston Beach at a rate of knots, burning properties out to and across the Forrest Highway. The fires came—there was so much changing wind. It changed all the time, and you never knew where the fires were coming from. Properties that had been missed in the first pass of the fires were then collected as the fires came back when the winds changed. The fires actually came to within 1.6 kilometres of the Harvey town site itself. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At one stage, we had fires at our property in Harvey coming at us from three different fronts. Fortunately, they did not actually get to us. Water bombers were constantly flying over the house and, all through this, our firefighters were front and centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had local volunteer fire brigades from Yarloop, Cookernup, Harvey, Uduc, Brunswick and right around the south-west and, of course, the Yarloop-Cookernup crews, fighting fires for others while their own homes were burning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These men and women, many of whom have trained for years to protect the community, were absolutely devastated when they could not save their own Yarloop community. They were absolutely exhausted in their efforts to do so. In the local newspaper, one Harvey volunteer said that he was in Yarloop and that 'when this inferno hit, it was like a wave of fire that just crashed through the school' that they were trying to protect. He said, 'Half the side of our fire engine just melted.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Yarloop fire brigade lost their actual fire station in that fire in Yarloop. They moved to the Cookernup fire station, and it became affectionately known as the 'Cookerloop' fire station. That is where I sat and met so many of the local Yarloop and Cookernup firefighters, and others from right around the region who were helping out with the fires. They had so much to deal with. I am just in awe of people who think of themselves as ordinary people but who do absolutely extraordinary things. And I met fireys from as far away as Rosa Brook, from Denmark in the south, from Cowaramup, from Margaret River, from Capel, and even those who came from New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I personally owe a huge thanks, as does our community—all the communities—to the volunteer and the professional firefighters who worked so hard and put their own lives at risk to fight these fires. I thank the local farmers who were also helping each other whenever their properties were under threat—and that was constant. I want to thank the army of volunteers in the community who were doing everything they could to help, whether it was helping to move horses, donating feed and hay or collecting stray horses and animals; the local businesses and individuals who donated food for the fireys, and to people and pets in evacuation centres; and the Brunswick football club and its volunteers, who prepared 2,500 meals for the various fire and volunteer stations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the Harvey shire council, the shire president, Tanya Jackson, and CEO, Michael Parker, as well as the multitude of agencies and organisations who worked tirelessly at the evacuation centres—and now the recovery centres—providing information and support as well as necessities to people, and those who are providing ongoing physical and emotional support—both are greatly needed. I want to acknowledge the generosity of the Australian people and businesses in supporting the many fundraising efforts aimed at helping those affected by the fires including, of course, Andrew Forrest, who actually came to Harvey to hold a meeting with the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Channel 9 for their wonderful concert for the local fireys, and the artists who donated their time. Anybody who saw the coverage of that on television could not help but be touched by the stories of the local fire brigade and the local volunteers who were there, all talking about what they had seen and done. I hope that concert and the presentation wins an award in time. I want to acknowledge the volunteers on the ground now—those who are helping farmers clean kilometre after kilometre of burnt out wire and fencing. I want to acknowledge Rotary, which got together to fund ongoing counselling services—free of charge—for those who need it most. I want to acknowledge Lions clubs. I want to acknowledge those who are helping out with the fencing, and BlazeAid as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about Harvey Primary School, which has incorporated the Yarloop Primary School within itself. They have created a place for all of those Yarloop Primary School students who are still in the area. So they have got their own little school; they will stay together as a community school within the Harvey Primary School. I congratulate everyone who has worked so hard to make that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say is that what we see in these times of great tragedy and trauma is the best in us: the best in us as Australian people; the best in us as communities; and the best in us for how we care for each other. Often the smallest things we do for each other in these times matter the most. But mostly—for anybody who is going to read this or is listening—I would say, please do not wait. Make your fire plan and write it down. Go to the DFES website—there is a book there; it is a fire management plan. Please write your own fire management plan—exactly what you are going to do. Write it down, because when you are in a crisis it can be very, very difficult to think clearly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you have your lists, if you know exactly what you need to take, how much food you need for each person and all the preparations you need to make, this will make the management of such a situation so much less traumatic and enable you and your families to be far safer. I encourage every person to do exactly that: to actually have your own fire management plan. Every time we have a tragedy such as what happened in Yarloop and around the Harvey Shire in Waroona, we always learn something from it, but one of the most important things is that we learn to have our own fire management plan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I too rise to add my voice to those of my colleagues from both sides of the House, recognising the effect of natural disasters over the summer and, in particular, fires that occurred within my own electorate. We still, obviously, have fires blazing in Tasmania, and they will take quite some time to put out, I understand, given the territory that they are in. We have had terrible fires, as we have just heard, in Western Australia and we have had floods in South Australia and in the Northern Territory. As always with summer, I cannot remember a first session that we have had in this place where we have not been talking about the effects over summer of fires or terrible floods. So I join my voice with colleagues today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate we had a fire the week before Christmas in the community of Scotsburn—one of the largest in our district for quite some time. The headline figure from the fire was that 12 homes were destroyed, but, of course, as terrible as the loss of those 12 homes is, it barely touches on the real toll of this blaze. When a home is destroyed, it is not just the building or the place that houses people that is lost; it is a lifetime of memories, care and achievements. One property that I know of lost six fully-restored vintage cars, where someone had poured their heart and soul into doing that. Where once stood a proud history, now stands blackened chimneys amid fields of devastation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even when the home is saved, the toll is still terrible. We have had livestock lost and fences, feed and crops destroyed, and families have been left to pick up the pieces and deal with the trauma that is left behind. It is not normal in your daily lives to experience that level of fear, where you think you are going to die. That is what many people in my communities faced. The fire came through so quickly that they just did not have time to respond. Many of them did incredibly well with great fire plans. Many still did not have fire plans in place or those fire plans were not adequate. We were very, very lucky on the day that we did not lose lives and that we did not lose the lives of fire crews. Fire crews were in the field within 10 minutes of the fire breaking out. They were fighting absolutely tooth and nail within 10 minutes of getting onto the fire ground in very, very difficult circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were at least 23 sheds lost and farming buildings destroyed, with more than 4,000 hectares burnt. Narmbool, a fantastic property that was gifted to the people of our area and which is managed by Sovereign Hill, our historic museum in Ballarat—it is a beautiful property—really did bear the brunt of it, with a large loss of livestock and certainly some outbuildings. Again, we were very lucky not to lose the historic homestead or lives in that particular area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families across the region literally fled their homes. There are stark images on the internet. There was a wedding taking place at the time, just about to happen, and 100 wedding guests had to flee very, very quickly as the fire came across the paddocks at the back. There are very stark images of a beautiful wedding ceremony. I do wish the couple who got married all the best. I know the day was not what you expected, but it will be a day that you talk about, I guess, very much for the rest of your lives. We are so grateful that the pub in Buninyong was able to accommodate you and all of your guests. Some have told me that when fires have happened in the past they have had to deal with memories of those. There are many people who were actively involved as firefighters in Black Saturday and who were also involved on the day. For good reason obviously, that sticks in their memories as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were very lucky. The drought has been very severe in our region. When we look at it, we had 300 firefighters on the ground beating back that fire. The firefighters are extraordinary. When I stopped at the Buninyong fire shed the day after, all they wanted to talk about were the homes they had lost. They are incredible people and they have done an extraordinary job, but their focus, always, is on what they did not do. I very clearly said to them, 'You should be very proud of your efforts. This could have been so, so much worse in our community.' The brigades of district 15 and beyond, who came to people's aid on the day, were fantastic. I know there are a multitude of stories that the community is still sharing as they repair and grieve the loss of what happened in their region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also made a visit to the fantastic Erickson sky crane crew who are based every year at the Ballarat Airport. They come for months at a time, away from their families in Canada, Ireland and across the world to live in our community with the sky crane crew. I do want to echo very strongly the words of my colleague in that. There has to be a national focus on our air capacity. The Commonwealth has done very well by purchasing sky crane capacity and leasing sky cranes, but if you look across the country to where that regional capacity is, to where regional airport can house and now mobilise the new LATs very quickly, we are behind the eight ball. There is a need for a national air program. I happen to know a little bit about this from a good friend of mine. This is something that the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General must look at. I would certainly be very happy in our own community to share our experiences of that. Again, the fact that no lives were lost was due to the heroic efforts of the crew, both on the ground and in the air on the day, and also the preparedness of people in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly want to thank the staff and volunteers who are still today supporting affected communities and individuals. There have been countless support staff from the Shire of Moorabool in the city of Ballarat, in particular. You have done an amazing job. I do not think I have seen a relief centre set up so quickly and operate so well in any of the fires I have been involved with , as a former CFA volunteer who has had some experience of these things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the community for their warmth, even in the smallest of things, from putting out the call when we were in the relief centre to get bottled water quickly to people on the day when we were trying to find out what was happening with the fire and the supermarket had run out bottled water through to people from across the communities delivering feed and volunteering for BlazeAid, coming for weeks on end—retired couples from across the country. I met people from Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia who had come to my community with their campervans for a couple of weeks just to build fences. BlazeAid are a terrific organisation and I do want to thank them very much for their efforts and local community people who spontaneously put on fundraisers and volunteered their time and hours of effort and donations—just the care people have shown to people in the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know fires are tragic events, but it is often the aftermath where people can get lost and can find themselves very traumatised, as I said, by what is not a normal experience for people to have . It is an incredibly traumatic thing not only to be in a fire but also then to have a loss of house. Even when you have not lost your house, there is the survivor guilt of 'why has my house been spared and my neighbours has not?' Being able to talk about these things is critical. I particularly do want to thank people in the community for their ongoing care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I live in an amazing place. Recently I was speaking to one of the people who had lost livestock in the fire. She and her family had moved up from Melbourne some three years ago. They did not have any particular traditional connections with the local community, they were not a farming family, and they had not really got to know their neighbours overwhelmingly well; they knew them in passing. She said she had never experienced such an overwhelming outpouring of community support. Scotsburn is a lovely place to live, and I want to thank people just for bringing their real care—not only the huge firefighting efforts by the volunteers and paid professionals who have been working there but everyday people who are just constantly checking that their neighbours are okay. The equestrian community in particular have been fantastic. So I want to thank them, and I know that this community will be all the stronger for the care that they have taken of each other throughout this natural disaster.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I strongly associate myself with the statements that have been made in parliament, and I support the comments that have been made by the member for Forrest. I acknowledge that the member for Forrest herself was involved in the very terrible Yarloop fires in Western Australia. The Waroona and Harvey shires were very much affected by a major blaze that broke out in the post-Christmas period, and 181 properties were lost, including 162 family homes. Two lives were lost: Les Taylor and Malcolm Taylor. As the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat, has said, I think the thing that really stands out for us all is just how strong and resilient our communities are and the degree to which people come in and support each other when these terrible tragedies have occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, front and centre are our thanks to our local firefighters—the volunteer fire brigades, the career firefighters and also the 120 firefighters and other personnel that came in from New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT. We really thank them for their incredible preparedness to put their lives on the line in dealing with the Yarloop-Waroona fires and the Esperance fires that occurred in November 2015, all within this one fire season. We acknowledge all the excellent work and the amazing community effort that was made to deal with the aftermath of these fires and to assist people, particularly those that had lost their homes and their possessions, in attempting to re-establish their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Yarloop is a particular tragedy. It is a town with immense, extraordinary historic interest in terms of both machinery and the built form—a very rich history which has now largely been lost. For many people in Yarloop, the ability to return to that town simply will not be there. We note that, understandably, Alcoa, who owned 35 of the homes that were destroyed, have decided not to rebuild, so there will be, without doubt, an enormous problem for many people who will now have to make that painful decision to move away from that very close community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect on what is happening with climate change in Western Australia and to say that, when we look at the facts, we see that our problem—what happened this summer with the Esperance and then the Waroona-Yarloop fires—is in fact only going to get worse. We recently saw the Climate Council release a report called <span style="font-style:italic;">The heat is on</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;">climate change, extreme heat and bushfires in Western Australia</span>. They made some very critical findings: the long-term trend is to hotter weather in Western Australia, and that this has worsened fire weather and contributed to an increase in the frequency and severity of bushfires. They go on to say:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">the number of professional firefighters in WA will need to more than double to meet the increasing risk of bushfires.</span>

                  </a>  They can move to Tasmania? It is a wonderful offer, but we are pretty attached to our patch over there and we would like to try to deal with this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously there are the macro issues that we need to deal with in terms of climate change, and that is a discussion for another day. But, quite clearly, we have to be the best we possibly can when fighting these fires. I am not in any way reflecting on the frontline skills that we have got, but I do question whether or not we are utilising the best technologies and best personnel that are available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was contacted by quite a number of reservist and ex-military personnel who expressed shock that they were not being called upon to assist in the support of the firefighters. They have an enormous array of equipment and personnel that can, at four hours notice, be mobilised. Indeed, many of these reservists say to us: 'Obviously we're not trained to hold the hose and fight the fire, but, my God, can we add backup to those fireys, to those guys, can we give logistical support to them—move people around. We could assist in the creation of firebreaks, the laying of retardant.' Indeed, there is extraordinary equipment that is available in defence in WA that could be utilised. There is a huge array of earthmoving equipment, gigantic water tanks and even the capacity to build temporary bridges, which would have come in handy in reopening some of the damaged bridges and enable the dairy farmers in particular to get their milk to market and not have to, unfortunately, just throw that milk away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see, particularly in Victoria and Queensland, a great preparedness to utilise that defence capacity. We know that defence has a well established protocol, a well established decision-making chain that would enable them to utilise this. At a forum for the victims of the fires, this question was asked: why didn't we bring the defence in to assist us? I was very disappointed when the answer came from the DFES officer there: 'We had enough tents, and that is what we use defence for.' I can say to you that defence in Western Australia has a capacity that goes well beyond the provision of tents. As I said, all of these well-trained personnel are eager to get in there and help our very brave and courageous fireys deal with this problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note that there has now been an inquiry called into the fire and the response to the fire, and that is very welcome. That is as it should be. I note there is not anything explicitly mentioned in that terms of reference about the potential for the utilisation of the defence resources, but hopefully that will be included—I will certainly be making submissions along that line. This is not the talk of armchair generals, as the Minister for Emergency Services in WA likes to call it; this actually comes from the heart of those people who understand what their capacities are, who understand what they could bring to the task if only they were utilised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also hope that there will be a proper analysis of the WA government's decision not to utilise the very generous offer of the DC-10 from the New South Wales government. I think that, as someone said, if our model does not include the use of those water tankers, those mass fire bombers, then we really should be reconsidering whether or not we have the right model. Once again, our grateful appreciation goes to all of those people who put their lives on the line, all of those volunteers. Of course, our very deep sympathy goes to those people who lost their homes and to the families of those people who lost their lives.</span>
