                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, may I just begin by properly congratulating you on your elevation to Speaker. You are a fine man. You have been a wonderful colleague in parliament. I know this is the course that you chose to take, but I wish you all the very best. You have my unqualified support in your role. I know Pam and the children will be very proud of you as well, for a long period of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="page-break-after:avoid;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to properly recognise that today is an auspicious occasion, not only because I am introducing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill but also because, in less than half an hour's time, Minister Robb and I will be hosting the Chairman of the NDRC, which is the most powerful economic body in China. Chairman Xu is here for the first strategic economic dialogue between Australia and China in Australia. We met in Beijing last year. Last year we set ourselves a goal to facilitate President Xi's visit to Australia and get renminbi clearing and a range of other initiatives announced. We also set a goal to have the free trade agreement signed between Australia and China, and we have achieved that. The third initiative was that we could resolve our differences and Australia would join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and we are doing that here and now. We are getting on with the job because ultimately a deeper and more profound relationship with China means more jobs for everyday Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unquestionably, Asia faces a major infrastructure financing gap, estimated to be worth US$8 trillion over the next decade. That is the funding shortfall for infrastructure that is going to grow the Asian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a significant step to address this challenge, Australia is becoming a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. This will help to fund major new infrastructure throughout the region. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a global multilateral initiative that will strive to bring best practice for the delivery of much-needed infrastructure to the entire region. It will catalyse private sector investment and it will co-finance projects with other development banks and private sector financiers. This is not a development bank but it is a bank that funds development. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's prosperity and economic growth are tied closely to the region. It is therefore important that we are involved in a major regional economic initiative such as the AIIB. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 June this year, I gave effect to the government's commitment to join the AIIB by being the first person in the world to sign the bank's articles of agreement in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. My signature was followed by those of representatives of 49 other countries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision to join the bank was made following extensive consultations with key partners inside the Asian region and outside the Asian region. This included participating in negotiations on the bank's design with 56 other prospective founding member countries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These negotiations resulted in a commitment that the bank will be based on world's best practice. This will ensure that all members will be involved in the direction and decision making of the bank. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the fifth-largest regional shareholder of the bank, Australia will be able to influence the bank's decisions and strategic direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Membership of the bank will provide an opportunity to further strengthen our engagement with the entire Asian region. It will also enrich our relationships with other member countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia will continue to work with China and other members to establish an institution that is effective, accountable and transparent and that complements the work of other institutions, such as the World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia will lead a constituency on the AIIB board of directors. Negotiations on the composition of this constituency with established partners in the region are well advanced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AIIB will have a strong commercial focus. Its goal is not poverty alleviation or development purposes such as that of the Asian Development Bank or even the World Bank. It is simply about funding the infrastructure that is going to grow the Asian economy to our great benefit. Of course, we will work closely with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank and learn from their long experience in promoting infrastructure in our region. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will implement our obligations under the bank's articles of agreement. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, it will provide an appropriation for the payment of Australia's capital contribution to the bank. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bank will initially have US$100 billion of total authorised capital and is expected to start operating by the end of this year.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's initial shareholding will be US$3.7 billion, including US$738 million in paid-in capital. The remaining US$2.9 billion is callable capital and will be a contingent liability on the Commonwealth balance sheet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's contribution will have a zero direct impact on the underlying cash balance, fiscal balance and net debt, as we are purchasing a shareholding in the bank. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the bill will authorise me, as the responsible minister, to issue promissory notes to the bank to discharge our financial obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, the bill will enable regulations to be made to extend necessary privileges and immunities to the bank, its staff and experts, and consultants performing services for the bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Membership of the bank will provide valuable trade and economic opportunities for our country. Australian businesses will benefit from improved infrastructure throughout the region, which will also help our commodity exporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In plain terms, if we can build new railway lines and ports in the region, that will mean that our product not only goes into those facilities. Our iron ore will go into the railway and port construction. More particularly, that infrastructure will then facilitate our agricultural produce getting to market. The Minister for Agriculture, who is not far away from going to Indonesia, knows that, if we can get better access through new ports, better railways and better transport corridors in Indonesia, we can get more of our agriculture to market. So we will win all ways.  We will fund and provide the infrastructure. Our experts in infrastructure are there giving advice on how to build the ports, airports, railways and even the universities—whatever the case might be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we build up Asia, as a middle-class emerges, they are going to want our food, education and health services. They are going to want to travel to Australia and invest in our services. This is the way to go. Prosperity in the Asian region is to our enormous benefit because, ultimately, it will mean more jobs in Australia. It is not pie-in-the-sky stuff. This is real, tangible, meaningful, actual policy being implemented that is a game changer. That is why we are joining the Asian infrastructure bank. It is not a foreign policy play; it is actually in our economic interests. It is in the economic interests of every single Australian that we participate in building the infrastructure in the region because, the more prosperous the Asian region is, the more prosperous our nation will be.</span>

For the money that we send to China to buy Chinese products, multiples of money from China come here to buy our products. Nothing illustrates that better than the breakthrough in live cattle exports by the Minister for Agriculture. How many cattle?</span>

                    </a>  Up to one million head of cattle per year. I have been to the Cloncurry Saleyards over the years. After the worst public decision I have ever seen—the immediate banning of live cattle exports from Australia based on a TV report—the farmers up there had no cattle in their saleyards and were nearly getting to the point where they had no option but to shoot their live cattle because they did not have the feed. When I went back to the Cloncurry Saleyards, 330,000 head of cattle went through those yards to provide food to people in developing countries who did not have access to food. That is what we are doing—we are feeding people who are more disadvantaged than us. This is what we are trying to achieve. We are trying to achieve an improvement in the quality of life for everyone.</span>

I thank colleagues for their support and also their advice during the course of negotiations to join this bank. This will deepen the relationship between Australia and China. It will deepen the relationship between Australia and many other countries that have joined the AIIB. Most particularly, this is going to represent an opportunity for new jobs and new prosperity for everyday Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I introduce a bill to reverse the previous government's changes to Australia's unclaimed moneys provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 31 December 2015, this bill will ensure that funds from Australians' bank accounts and life insurance policies can only be transferred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission after they have been inactive for at least seven years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has had provisions to effect the transfer of unclaimed funds to the government since at least 1911. They exist to protect Australians' forgotten funds from being eroded by fees and charges, but no matter what, these funds continue to belong to their rightful owner and can be reclaimed at any time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 1911 and 2012, accounts must have been inactive for at least seven years before funds could be transferred to the Commonwealth. Under these rules, only $70 million in unclaimed funds were transferred to ASIC in 2011-12. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However in late 2012, the previous government reduced the required period of inactivity to three years. This resulted in $550 million from thousands of accounts being transferred to ASIC in 2012-13—an almost eightfold increase in a single year. Many of these accounts were certainly not unclaimed or forgotten, but were transferred to the government regardless in order to improve the budget bottom line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Australians this meant cancelled holidays and delays in purchasing new goods—washing machines, dishwashers, and cars—that were crucial to their families. For some Australians the consequences of not being able to access their hard-earned savings when they needed to were even more severe. Many Australians, particularly in regional areas, were placed in positions of financial difficulty. In the worst cases, some individuals have had to sell their homes. This is unacceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did not support this change in opposition and, as promised, in government we will make it right. That is why, in the 2015-16 budget, we committed to reforming the unclaimed moneys provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning the required period of inactivity before savings and life insurance policies can be transferred to ASIC to seven years will drastically reduce the number of effectively active accounts that are transferred to ASIC each year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change will cost the government $285 million over four years, however will save the community $36 million each year in reduced red tape costs as fewer accounts must be transferred from, and returned, to account holders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To further ensure that only funds that are truly forgotten are transferred to ASIC, this bill also expands the ways in which account holders can keep their accounts active. This bill will ensure that if an account holder alerts their financial institution to the fact that they are aware of their account in any way prior to their funds being transferred to ASIC—including simply checking a balance online—that transfer will no longer occur. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also exempt children's accounts and foreign currency accounts from the unclaimed moneys provisions entirely. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians set money aside for their children's future and trust that this money will continue to grow in value and be available for their children when they are ready. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recognition of this fact and to reward, not punish, those Australians working hard to contribute to their family's future, children's accounts will never be transferred to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Foreign currency accounts, meanwhile, are primarily used by sophisticated consumers to settle complex business transactions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only does transferring these accounts to the government potentially disrupt these processes, it also exposes the account holder to the risk of a loss as their funds must be converted to Australian dollars at the prevailing exchange rate before they can be transferred to ASIC. In line with the government's commitment to protect Australian businesses from excessive red tape, these types of products will also be exempted entirely from the unclaimed moneys provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did the changes made by the previous government leave many Australians financially distressed, the unprecedented growth in the value of money transferred to ASIC also highlighted glaring deficiencies in the way that account holders' personal information is protected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC is currently required to publish an unclaimed money gazette online with detailed personal information, which includes a person's name, last known address and the amount of money they have unclaimed. The Information Commissioner has raised concerns about the potential for identity theft using currently published information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some unscrupulous businesses are also using this information to charge fees as high as 25 per cent to reunite people with their own money. The government and financial institutions do not charge account holders for this service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To protect those Australians with unclaimed moneys from exploitation, this bill will remove the requirement for ASIC to publish the unclaimed money gazette and will introduce secrecy provisions to ensure that only individuals with unclaimed accounts or those acting on their behalf will be able to access their data through freedom of information requests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As stated before, this bill delivers on the government's promise to reform the unclaimed moneys provisions and contributes to the government's promise to support Australian business by reducing red tape by at least $1 billion each and every year. This bill will leave more Australians in control of their own finances, better protect their personal information, and leave a safety net in place to protect those with truly forgotten amounts from having their value eroded by fees and charges. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:22</span>):  Mr Speaker, I think this is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate you on your elevation to the Speaker's chair. Well done. I am sure you will do an outstanding job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill concerns radiation protection and nuclear safety. When I first attended a political protest in 1983, I never imagined that I would be standing here in the Parliament of Australia speaking as a shadow minister on a bill which concerned the regulation of nuclear safety. That is not because becoming a member of parliament was a remote, if not unattainable, aspiration for someone of my background but because the protest I was attending actually concerned the question of nuclear weapons. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in those days, there was a very real concern that an accelerated arms race in nuclear weapons and the heightened Cold War tensions posed a near and present danger to our national security and the security of the entire globe. By 1986, just three years after I attended that protest, it was estimated that throughout the world there were 40,000 nuclear warheads, the equivalent of one million Hiroshima bombs. The prospect of a <span style="font-style:italic;">Dr Strangelove</span> scenario was the stuff of nightmares, but, to many of us, it was also very real. Many people in this chamber will remember what it felt like to grow up with the possibility of a nuclear catastrophe within our lifetime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reminded of those early political experiences last week when we marked the 40th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I remain opposed to nuclear weapons and share the concerns of all members of this House that the technology of fissile materials developed for peaceful purposes can be diverted for other reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has always been a responsible and proactive member of the international community when it comes to nuclear nonproliferation. We have made a substantial contribution, including through capacity-building programs, to strengthening nuclear safeguards and safety and security regimes. We have been particularly active in the Asia-Pacific region and we will continue to strongly support international efforts, including the imposition of a UN and autonomous sanction to confront proliferation threats posed by North Korea and Iran.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we should never forget that nuclear technology can do a great deal of good. Australia has operated a research reactor since 1958, and it produces, amongst other things, medical isotopes that are used in hospitals and for treatments around the country. Literally thousands of people are alive today because of, or have had their lives enhanced by, this technology, and we must never forget that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1973, the Australian Radiation Laboratory was established. It was responsible for providing advice to the government of the day and the community on the effects of radiation on health; undertaking groundbreaking research; and providing services in this area. It was in 1997 that ARPANSA was formed, when the Australian Radiation Laboratory and the Nuclear Safety Bureau were merged, and that body continues to play a vital role. It is critical to scientific research, it regulates nuclear medicines and it advises governments and industry. It is also responsible for protecting the Australian people from the harmful effects of radiation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During Labor's most recent time in government, ARPANSA made a great deal of progress and was very active. For example, in 2010 the Australian National Radiation Dose Register was established to provide an electronic database for workers exposed to radiation. This ensures that records of workers radiation doses are maintained in a centralised register, regardless of where the individual is working. Once again, Labor put the safety of workers first. It is no good conducting scientific research or protecting the Australian public if we are not protecting those people who are working directly with radioactive material. We have looked after them and we will continue to do that, and that is what this bill, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Bill, is about. So we take the issue of radiation and nuclear safety very seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our view, the bill strengthens the powers of ARPANSA, our nuclear safety agency. There are a number of changes to the licensing arrangements administered by ARPANSA, which will have the effect of improving safety and efficiency, and closing a number of loopholes identified in an audit conducted by the ANAO. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the recent submissions received by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for its inquiry on this bill—the committee has not yet reported. I thank the Senate and, in particular, the expert contributors to this process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be supporting the bill in the House. We will look closely at any recommendations that are made by the Senate committee. This is an important part of public policy; a belt-and-braces approach is warranted. But, on the face of it, we believe this is a bill that Labor will be able to offer bipartisanship support for. Having a strong regulatory body for radiation protection and nuclear safety here in this country is something that should rise above the fray of partisan politics. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:28</span>):  Mr Speaker, I add my congratulations to those that have already been offered on your elevation to high office. This bill amends the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 to ensure that Australia's regulation of radiation activities remains at the forefront of international best practice. Drawing on the recommendations of various reviews and the experience of ARPANSA, this bill makes changes to the legislation to provide greater clarity regarding the reach of the legislation so that it improves risk management of radiation activities undertaken by Commonwealth entities and provides greater capacity for ARPANSA to act in the event of an emergency or noncompliance with the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be remiss of me to pass up this opportunity to discuss nuclear power in the main. I led the debate on nuclear power with a speech to parliament in March 2005. Nuclear power is cheap, clean, safe and sustainable. The challenges are as real as the opportunities are great. Having led the charge on the nuclear issue in this place in the past, I know that support for nuclear is not limited by party ties. There are real fears in the community about nuclear power, but let this not rule out or reduce the scope of our imagination or possibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2005 I tried to ignite a national conversation regarding the use of nuclear power for domestic applications. In latter times I have spoken extensively about the incomparable benefits of adopting and/or just allowing a nuclear choice in terms of the potential submarine mix. Post Collins class, we all need to look at performance and value for money and an ability to protect Australia and our people. So, on whatever front one chooses to look—be it domestic energy generation, national defence or even nuclear waste storage—having a mature, reasoned and real debate can only be in Australia's interest. I welcome the royal commission in South Australia into nuclear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is well known that former Prime Minister Hawke is a strong supporter of using our vast desert interior for nuclear waste storage. This type of bravery and imagination is what will get Australia firing again. Australia stands to gain from lower electricity costs, increased competitiveness, greater national security independence and massive and sustainable employment for thousands. This new industry is so obvious and so possible. To those opposing the proposed debate, I say that now is the time to stop stopping and start starting—a new perspective, a new opportunity. George Bernard Shaw is often quoted as saying, 'I see things that never were and say, "Why not?"' Today the debate on nuclear is at the same turning point of history. The challenges of the future will only be greater.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is there are things in the environment we all want—clean air, clean water, good food and reducing birth rates. Look at the countries in the world with the cleanest air, cleanest water, lowest birth rates and best food. They are all affluent. McNair Ingenuity Research showed that, between 1979 and 2009, those in favour of the construction of nuclear power stations increased from 34 per cent to 49 per cent, with around 10 per cent undecided. More people are in favour of nuclear power than are opposed. It is not the will of the people to take nuclear energy off the table. If the Greens and Labor do not embrace nuclear power as a possibility, then they are not serious in their assertions about reducing CO<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2</span> emissions. They also cannot continue to argue that we should have a nuclear ban as it is economically too expensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to repeal section 10 of the ARPANSA Act 1998. It would remove a prohibition on a Commonwealth body operating a power reactor and would allow nuclear energy to be one of the options explored for most efficiently conserving and producing cleaner energy for Australia in the longer term. In the national interest, it is time to move past the politics of fear. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a growing realisation in Europe and Asia that, for a variety of reasons, nuclear is the future. Poland is planning on having its first nuclear plant by 2020, and Britain has decided to replace its ageing reactors and create new sites. France, which is the nation most dependent on nuclear energy, with about 75 to 80 per cent of France's energy nuclear generated, has ordered its 61st nuclear generator. China's nuclear generation capacity is on track to go from nine gigawatts to 70 gigawatts by 2020—an enormous increase. An MIT report said that China may have to add as many as 200 nuclear power plants by 2050 to meet its energy demands. There is also a huge market in India, which has been a contentious issue that Australia cannot ignore. This new economic giant has 15 operating nuclear power plants and seven under construction. India knows that the only way to enhance the lives of its people is via access to power. Currently, an estimated 400 million Indians still have no access to electricity. Nuclear power can change that dramatically.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Going right back to the early history of mankind, each significant advancement in our civilisation has gone hand in hand with new energy sources. There were gradual developments in our civilisations over the following centuries but the next enormous, exponential leap in the development of human society, especially in the West, was the Industrial Revolution. That advance would have been impossible without a quantum leap in the development of energy sources—specifically, using coal to make steam, which literally drove the Industrial Revolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thus energy became, once again, the literal driver of mankind's incredible advances over the last couple of centuries. And now, once again, energy is front and centre in the deliberations of many governments. The economic benefits to Australia of this initial step by the federal government would be huge. The mantra, over the last few weeks, has been the importance of keeping jobs in Australia to try and insulate us as much as possible from the disasters befalling the world economy. New projects, such as the expansion of current mines and the opening of new ones, will provide the very best economic stimulation possible. This means real jobs, real and significant infrastructure, real earnings from real wealth and, most importantly, creating wealth instead of borrowing it from future generations of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there is the ultimate flow-on effect from this and other similar arrangements which will surely come in the near future. Although European countries are now expressing renewed interest in nuclear power, there is one principal problem associated with this reawakening. There was flourishing nuclear science going on in parallel with the development of nuclear power in the fifties and sixties. Then, with a realigning of ideology to fit the antiprogressive theology of extreme and almost unquestioned green politics, these nuclear programs became unpopular in some countries. Germany, the UK and others, which had once embraced the new technology, were browbeaten by the disingenuous scare tactics of the Left to start winding back their nuclear programs. They started decommissioning nuclear power stations and basically recanted on their faith in nuclear power, on which they had previously relied to provide non-fossil fuel power for the future. France, of course, was an exception, because it had no natural energy resources of its own. Not surprisingly, France did not want to be beholden to other countries for gas or oil, so the preference for nuclear energy was easy. As the French say about nuclear power: no coal, no gas, no oil—no choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the other countries are coming around to their previous position and looking once again to nuclear power. They realise that nuclear power can carry them over at least the next century while new energy sources are being investigated and developed. The big problem is that, while their nuclear programs were up and running, they had the expertise to run these programs. With the winding back of nuclear energy programs, there was little or no renewal of this expertise. As the nuclear industry was diminishing, the men and women who were highly trained in this area were getting old and retiring. Thus, just when they are so badly needed, where are the nuclear scientists and technologists who will be needed to back up the increased demand for this energy? We can stick our heads in the sand and pretend we can somehow make do without nuclear energy, as the extreme so-called environmentalists do, or we can admit that energy is the key to the world's future, stop kidding ourselves about pie-in-the-sky energy sources and get real. Let us take this once-in-a-lifetime conjunction of events and make the most of it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing we should be talking about is putting money into research and development. We need to look at putting money into generation IV reactors, which have significant advantages over conventional reactors because not only, in many cases, can these reactors use the uranium resource for 50 to 60 times longer than conventional reactors but also they can use as fuel depleted fuel from conventional reactors, and the waste form that you are left with is literally safe to handle within a period of about 300 years. We should also be investing in thorium research. Once again, Australia has the largest thorium reserves in the world. Another technology that we should invest in—and this would even be for people who are somewhat paranoid about fission power—is nuclear fusion. At present there is a great international program called ITER—it stands for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor—in France. It is one of the largest scientific projects in the world. In effect, it is a preproduction fusion prototype. This is a very clean energy resource, and I think it is foolhardy for Australia not to be involved. If we are not one of the major program partners we should certainly be one of the subpartners in the project, because Australia is one of the world's energy superpowers in terms of nuclear energy, be it fission or fusion. You can talk about uranium, you can talk about thorium and, indeed, you can talk about lithium, which is the feedstock for nuclear fusion. Western Australia has one of the largest resources of lithium in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be looking at becoming more energy independent, and getting involved in these sorts of areas would certainly make us more energy independent. It is time for Australia to have a mature conversation about nuclear in the energy mix. It is time to get clear about the legislative context, and this new clear will be an all-clear for nuclear—an all-clear for jobs, growth and opportunity. As I have said many times before, it is time to stop stopping and start starting.</span>

I thank the member for Tangney and the member for Throsby for their contributions. As we have discussed, this bill amends the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 to ensure that Australia's regulation of radiation activities remains international best practice. Radiation protection and nuclear safety is a dynamic area. It is constantly evolving. International approaches and industry practice have changed a lot since 1998, and Australia needs to remain at the forefront of these changes. Australia is fortunate to have a strong regulator in the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency—ARPANSA. The regulatory scheme has stood the test of time and provided Australians with essential protections, but the time is right to update the legislation and to ensure that ARPANSA has the powers it needs for the decade ahead. To this end, this bill improves capacity for end to end risk management and provides ARPANSA with greater powers to monitor compliance with the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments also support the CEO of ARPANSA to better respond in the event of an emergency by enabling the CEO to issue directions to licence holders to minimise any risks to people and the environment in unforeseen circumstances. Importantly, all action taken by ARPANSA in response to noncompliance or to emergencies will continue to be reported quarterly and annually to the parliament, and also publicly on the ARPANSA website. This ensures that there is absolute accountability and transparency about the radiation activities being undertaken by Commonwealth agencies and about the actions taken by the regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistent with this government's commitments, the changes do not have any financial impact and nor do they increase any compliance burden for individuals, business or community organisations. The amendments simply update and improve the legislation.</span>

I am advised that the view has been taken, where there is an expansion of the purposes for which money may be drawn from a standing appropriation, section 56 of the Constitution requires that the proposed appropriation be recommended by a message from the Governor-General.

But I do point out that it has been a bit of a debacle, that these matters were not considered in the original bill. With the number of amendments that the government has had to make, both here in the House and in the Senate to its own legislation, it has been pretty clear this has not been thought out as well as it could have been. But we are happy to accommodate this procedure.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:49</span>):  I just want to make a few brief remarks. Most of our remarks have been conveyed in the Senate during the course of the debate there, but I would like to speak to a number of those amendments, in particular to amendment No. 20.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are strong supporters of medical research and, in particular, any initiative to increase funding for medical research. That is for a number of reasons that have been well canvassed elsewhere. Medical research in this country is essential to our country's wellbeing. But also, as we consider the role of Australia in the 21st century we have to ask ourselves a pretty important question, which is: what is Australia going to sell to the rest of the world when the rest of the world tells us to stop digging? We will never be able to compete with China or India on wages, and nor should we try. Australia's future will be contingent on having strong export markets in areas like medical research and innovation, where we already have an advantage and where, with the proper government support, we can continue to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with some concern that we note that recently there has been a drop-off in the value of the medical research industry and related products in Australia and their exports. We should be taking steps to address that, and boosting funding is one of those ways. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we had our way, as the Greens, we would argue for greater recurrent funding to medical research through NHMRC and other bodies. The government has proposed the establishment of a fund that will invest money, and then the interest of that will be used for medical research. That is not necessarily how we would have done it, but the initiative, such as it is, is to be welcomed if it results in increased funding for medical research in this country. Certainly, that is something I have seen firsthand in my electorate of Melbourne: the significance of the discoveries from medical research for the Australian community and also for our economy, both locally and internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that respect there are three areas that the Greens have drawn attention to during this debate. The first concern is that this would ultimately not be additional money but could potentially result in cost-shifting away from the NHMRC and from other areas. Investment in medical research such as is being proposed by the government is only good if it is genuinely additional money. To that extent, I am pleased that amendment (20), which has been accepted and ultimately moved by the government, will ensure that when the review takes place it has a strong eye to looking at ensuring that there has not been cost-shifting away from the NHMRC or from the ARC or, indeed, from the money that flows through higher education grants. It is important to ensure that these funds are genuinely additional funds for medical research. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area that we are pleased the minister made some comments about on the record in the Senate concerns investment in tobacco. Because of the way that these funds will be managed, we wanted to ensure that they would not be funds that were invested in tobacco, the proceeds of which would then be used for medical research. That would be something which I think the Australian public would disagree with, and I am pleased that there has been an undertaking that the funds which medical research will be drawn on in this fund will not be invested in tobacco. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last matter that the minister has put on the record in the Senate and that we were hopeful to get some more progress on—and we will continue to do so over the course of this parliament; I understand the minister has undertaken to look at it—is when this fund results in investment in a company that generates significant private return. If, as a result of this fund, we see the next cochlear implant—and there are many, many developments, particularly in Melbourne and in Australia that might lead us to think that we are on the verge of some pretty important discoveries and therefore some pretty important products to be manufactured—and if it does result in significant private benefit, there should be a mechanism to ensure that some of that private financial benefit generated by a private company finds its way back to the public purse. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, it would be ideal if the Medical Research Future Fund had a stream of revenue in an analogous way that CSIRO gets a return from the Wi-Fi patents. If this results in significant private benefit, some of that money should find its way back to the MRFF so that we can then invest in more public research. This way it will ensure that it will not just be a private good that benefits but that the public good benefits as well. This is something that we will continue to progress. In the meantime, we will be supporting these amendments because any money that comes new to medical research is to be welcomed and supported. So we will be supporting the amendments in this place. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AMR" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ballarat</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  I want to from the outset make a few remarks. The Labor Party will be supporting these amendments, as we did in the Senate, and we will support the passage of the bill. But let us be very clear about what has happened here. The initial bill as presented in this place had not got any input from Health at all. So we have managed through the processes here in the House and the Senate to deal the health department and the health minister in, because they were not in before. We have managed through the processes in the House and the Senate to get some better integration between this bill and the NHMRC. But Labor's view is that it is not enough. It does not meet the government's own stated budget papers as to what the purpose of this fund was to be. The budget papers state that the money was to be predominantly paid through the National Health and Medical Research Council. When the fund was envisaged—and I think it has to be acknowledged that this fund did not come out of the health department or out of health policy and that in fact it was thought up through a separate process—and when it was eventually disclosed to the public that this is what the government was planning to do, the government stated that it was going to be funded and that it was going to utilise the NHMRC processes to disburse this money. That is not what it has done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an improvement on what we had previously, but I do want to make it very clear that a Labor government would seek to amend it, to put the purpose in place very clearly that we think that expert and peer review is the only way we can make sure that we get the best quality health and medical research in this country. The sidelining of the NHMRC will, I think, be something that will be looked upon very poorly in years to come. So we will of course be watching the decisions the government makes about the disbursements of these funds. I remind the House that in fact the former CEO of the NHMRC, Warwick Anderson, stated very clearly that when judging how to use public money for research only peer review can identify what is valuable and what is not. He went on to say: 'NHMRC<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s almost 80 years of effective ethical and efficient service to the Australian community means that public trust in the Medical Research Future Fund will be maintained if the NHMRC plays the major role in administering the earnings of the fund in accordance with the advisory board strategy.' That is the former CEO of the National Health and Medical Research Council, and we agree with him. We absolutely agree with him. I want to make that clear. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been an extraordinarily poor policy process from the outset. What has had to happen through the course of the debate about this bill is that Labor has had to try and force the government into a position where it considers the policy parameters under which it funds health and medical research. It was not thought through. The initial bill did not contain any advisory structures. It did not contain any expert opinion at all to try and look at what the best strategic direction was. It had no links to the National Health and Medical Research Council and very little role at all for the Minister for Health, the health department or health policy makers; this has had to be done through the process. I think it is very disappointing that the Senate did hold an inquiry. Obviously, a deal had already been done between the Greens and the government on this bill, so Labor had to try and prosecute some of this on its own. The government paid very scant attention to the many, many voices in the research community who said that this is not the way to go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know there are a lot of powerful and vested interests in this space. We all get them coming into our office on a regular basis. It is why we have the National Health and Medical Research Council and peer review to determine what the best medical research is going to be. It is why politicians do not get to decide. I think the danger in this bill is that some very powerful voices have been listened to and some less powerful voices have not been. I think that that is going to be, in the longer term, to the detriment to health and medical research. I do want to put on record that we, when in government, were very strong supporters and we will continue to be so. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Extension of time granted)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>We will continue to be so both from opposition and from government, should we ever be fortunate enough to form government again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, it would be entirely remiss of me to not remind this place of just where the money for this fund has come from and of the extraordinary divide that this government has put on those who at the front-line of our health services every single day, providing services to people who are coming into general practice surgeries, who are seeing specialists and who are trying to get access to medicines. The money has come from funding cut from prevention, funds from the freeze on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and funds from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes, which will make harder for people to access medicines. I have to say that those changes have not passed the Senate and are not likely to, but that money is still being counted as being within this fund. All of the cuts to health and to direct services to people are where the money for this fund has come from. It would be remiss of me not to say again to the government that: we support medical research, but at what cost have you done this—at what cost to direct service provision for people across the community who are already feeling the brunt of the MBS freeze when they go into general practices across the community? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, as I said, will support these amendments. I want to again point out that it is an unusual circumstance to have a government have to move in this place some 22 amendments to its own legislation and in the other place 20 amendments to its own legislation. It stuffed it up, basically. It did not do the work. It had not actually consulted about what this policy would look like and what would the best disbursement process would be. It made absolutely no reference at all to McKeon, which is the review into medical research. The fact that there was no discussion about how you might leverage this funding off philanthropic organisations, off other business or off other capacity to build capital is a missed opportunity, and an opportunity that McKeon outlined should be pursued. Again, this is a missed opportunity to go through the recommendations of McKeon and see how this funding could leverage the actual outcomes for those recommendations. No reference by the government, in this entire Medical Research Future Fund process, has ever been made to the McKeon review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I put on the record that, whilst we will support these amendments, we do not think that this is the best way that this fund could have been established. It is not the best way nor the most transparent way. Without peer review, without expert review and without a clear and transparent process for disbursements, this is not the best way that this fund could have been administered. Obviously, we are not going to pursue further amendments here in this place, but we will be watching the government very closely as it starts to make announcements in relation to this fund—particularly in an election year. We want to make sure that the reputation of health and medical research in this country is maintained. We want to make sure that it is not just the most powerful voices that get access to this fund. We want to make sure that it is not just the voices that manage to get the ear of government or the support of government that get access to this fund. Access must be on the basis of what is the best quality health and medical research and of what is going to make the most beneficial difference to this community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I say to the government that we remain happy to work with you on sensible health reforms that will improve health outcomes in this country. In our view, you have missed an opportunity with this Medical Research Future Fund. It has been an incredibly poor process, as shown by the way in which the bill has been managed through both chambers. We are pleased that we have managed to get health dealt into this bill. It is something that you should have done from the start. We are pleased that we at least managed, through the Senate inquiry, to have some of the broader voices of the medical research community heard. We will support the bill and we certainly remain very strong supporters of medical research.</span>

                    </a>  The member for Ballarat, I listened to you. I listened to you attack the government for 10 minutes, and I think it is appropriate that you listen to the response. I think we need to make the point about what Labor's record tells us about medical research. We know that after the Howard government was re-elected in 2001, the spending on medical research ramped up by a multiple of four between 2001 and 2006. There was an enormous increase in the total quantum allocated to medical research in principle during the time that the now Prime Minister was health minister. If we contrast that with Labor's record, in the 2011 budget, Labor tried to take out $400 million by rephasing the way that the NHMRC, which the member for Ballarat talked about today, was paid and distributed its funding. </span>

                    </a>  It was a pretty amazing contribution that we have just heard from the member for Ballarat suggesting that Labor's record on medical research is a good one.

                    </a>  To suggest, as the member for Ballarat and as the opposition did when this bill was introduced into this place, that this is a slush fund is a disgrace. I know Labor knows a lot about slush funds, because they have had such good experience with them. You only have to think about pink batts, BER or the Early Years Quality Fund. Labor should have known perfectly well not to identify this as a slush fund. Identifying it in that way was an insult to every medical researcher in this country. In all the conversations I have had, we have heard very positive responses about what this fund will do, how it will do it and the way it will be distributed. This has been met with incredibly broad support. It has not been suggested to me by any individual anywhere that we have been going about this in the wrong way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, it is a competitive field. The overwhelming message that comes back to the government is this: 'Please, we want more money.' That is what this fund does, by building up a corpus of $20 billion and distributing $1 billion every single year. There is a secure, on going and sustainable stream of funding for medical research which there has never been before, which is world leading and world beating and which we know will produce remarkable results. There will be an independent expert panel: the advisory board, as the member describes. There was always an independent expert panel. There is, I believe, certain scope for a strategic look at the way medical research is done, with some opportunities that those experts will feed into a process led by the Chief Scientist, fitting into the Australian government's national research priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To suggest that that smacks of vested interest, again, is an insult to all of those people who I know will have a strong say in that process. We very much support the curiosity driven, bottom-up research that the NHMRC produces and we know that the average $800 million a year disbursement from that will continue. We also have the support of the two organisations, with each other, for their disbursements going into the future. I am sorry that the member for Ballarat, having initially called this fund a slush fund, is here trying to smear what I know will be a positive contribution to the nation's future. Really, this should not be the least bit political.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I will respond to a couple of comments that have been made, including about the Greens. The first thing to clarify is that, although the government may seek in its budget papers to make a number of cuts to other areas of health to fund this, those proposed cuts are completely independent of this fund. They will continue to be opposed in the Senate and elsewhere, just as we helped stare down the GP fee that was intended to be one of the primary mechanisms for funding this in the first place. We have a position of supporting the fund without supporting the way in which the government proposes to fund it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of cuts, I think neither the government nor the opposition comes to that with clean hands. I recall one of the best demonstrations that I have been at. I have been at a few, but one of the best of them was to see 5,000 scientists and researchers in their lab coats turning out on the steps of the state library in Melbourne when it was suggested, proposed and leaked that the former Labor government was going to cut funding to health and medical research. The Discoveries Need Dollars campaign put health and medical research on the agenda in a way that it had not been before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The message that came out of that very, very clearly from scientists and researchers—who would much rather spend their time doing their research and who do not want to be subject to the vicissitudes of the political cycle, because so much of this research goes on over cycles that are much longer than the three-year electoral cycle and certainly the yearly budget cycle—was that they wanted some secure funding to know that having a career in health and medical research in Australia was something that would be a good thing, that you could rely on some security and that you would not have to go, year by year every time the budget comes around, and worry about funding being cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Directly as a result of that pressure came a positive move from the last government, which was the McKeon review. It said: 'Let's sit down and—rather than dealing with this on a year-by-year basis, which just makes everyone feel incredibly uncertain—let's have a look at what would be a good, long-term plan to secure science and research and now the medical field in this country.' The McKeon review came up with a number of very, very good recommendations. It was not just this government who ignored it; the last government ignored it as well. They commissioned it and then it sat in a draw. They did not even go to the election promising to implement the McKeon review, whereas the Greens did. The Greens sat down, read the McKeon review and came up with a number of costed initiatives that would put health and medical research on a secure footing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that came out of the McKeon review was that there is a gap in Australia—there is a gap. On the one hand, we have got very, very good funding and peer reviewed funding coming through the National Health and Medical Research Council. The McKeon review suggested that that be strengthen. But what it also said is that once you have finished that research and once you have done that, then is there a big gap when it comes to trying to translate it and then not only to translate it but also to potentially commercialise it as well. Unlike in the UK, for example, where there are billions of dollars set aside in various trusts and unlike the US where there is much greater investment as well, including philanthropically, there are not the places to go to in Australia to take those good discoveries that might have come through NHMRC funded research and then translate them once you have passed the proof of concept stage. There is also the second valley of death, if you like, identified in the McKeon review, which was the commercialising of them. How do you commercialise them and ensure that then the benefits stay inside Australia? It is those gaps that have been ignored up until now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government came along in the last budget with a proposal for a medical research future fund. I think it has to be said that it was almost certainly something that was cooked up very quickly to justify the GP co-payment—that is what it was. It was almost an afterthought for the GP co-payment. There was a suggestion that if we do this, then somehow people will swallow paying more to go to see their doctor. Well, they did not. We managed to see off the GP co-payment, although the pause in indexation is meaning that it is coming in many ways through the back door. We managed to see that off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But out of the ashes of that, we managed to make sure in this parliament that we did not throw the baby out with the bathwater. A good idea in essence—of let's find ways of coming up with additional funds for health and medical research that meet those gaps, that do not duplicate the NHMRC and that allow for the translation and then potentially commercialisation—was able to be sustained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, some of the criticisms are right. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Extension of time granted)</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Out of that, I think it is fair to say that initial legislation did not pay sufficient attention to how you might fill that gap. That is why, in the course of the Senate process and in the course of the Senate inquiry, as well as in the debate, we have focused on a couple of matters. Firstly, as I said before let's make sure that this is additional money. And let's make sure that it is not duplicating what the NHMRC does but instead is working in tandem with what the NHMRC does. If it does that—if it steps into the gaps that have been identified in the McKeon review—then it will be a good thing. As I said before, our preference would have been to fund it directly rather than to have to put aside a couple of billion and then just take the interest off it to put into medical research. Why not give the money directly to medical research in the first place?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, this is what the government has proposed. We feel that we have been able to fix it and to make it better so that, hopefully, it means that Australia finds itself in a similar situation to the US or the UK, where there is some security and some funding that will fill the gaps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the last government—and it continued under this government—we have seen spending on science and research and development fall to the lowest amount since we started keeping records in the late seventies. If this goes some way to getting us up from 2.2 per cent of GDP spent on R&amp;D back towards three per cent, ideally, and then, hopefully, up to the four or five per cent that some of our trading partners are, it will be a good thing. We will be keeping a watchful eye on it as well, to ensure that the money goes where it is meant to go. That is why it is important that the review mechanism is built in. I think the member for Ballarat is right that it is important that there is a much greater integration with the NHMRC to ensure that there is not overlap, and to ensure that the two are dovetailing. If all of that works, it will be a very good thing.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIGGS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I rise in support of the statement given to this House by the Prime Minister in respect of the centenary of the Anzac landings on 25 April 1915. Of course, we are now in August and it is an appropriate time to remember the August Offensive and the Lone Pine battle. This is a vital part of Australia's cultural history. We commemorate Anzac Day on 25 April each year, not specifically about the Gallipoli landings but about all service that people give in the name of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the first significant contribution that we made as a country. I think the reason it is so significant to our culture is that we were not forged in fire like so many other democracies—the Americans, who often celebrate the American Revolution and the Civil War and, of course, the United Kingdom had similar experiences. But Australia negotiated through argument and debate for our Constitution. When we formed our nation, it was not actually formed through a battle. I think this is why this contribution in 1915 was so significant to our cultural history, why it is so significant going forward and why it is so important to recognise what was then done in Europe, what was done in the Second World War, what was done in Vietnam and what was done in so many other contributions that we have made. Obviously, we continue to make them today in Iraq, where servicemen and women are giving their lives for our freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The statement that the Prime Minister gave to this House and the bipartisan nature of the fact that we are commemorating this occasion is very significant. I think the government did a good thing with the local grants program that each electorate oversaw. In my own electorate we had a Mr Jock Statton AM, who was formerly the president of the South Australian RSL branch, chair that committee to ensure that the funding was appropriately handed out right across the electorate. He did an outstanding job with his committee, made up of Kym McHugh, Christine Bell, Ann Herraman, Julie Reece and Mike McRae, in ensuring that RSLs particularly received money to help ensure that the legacy, and that the contribution that was made all those years ago continues to be commemorated each year, and that we continue to focus on 25 April on the sacrifices made by those people at that time, all others since then and all those in the future that will continue to serve our great country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a very important year for us to remember that. We will continue to remember the many battles that Australian troops fought in, particularly in Europe in the latter part of the First World War, where the sacrifice was immense and the legacy substantial. This has been a terrific opportunity for us to remember all that sacrifice from so many who have made our country so great.</span>

The nation paused on 25 April 2015 to remember the bravery and selflessness shown by Australian and New Zealand soldiers at the Gallipoli landings 100 years ago.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These moments were not lost in Bennelong, which saw thousands of residents turn out on Anzac Day to commemorate those who served at a number of local memorials. I am immensely proud of the efforts made by our local RSLs and the dedication of the public who turned out to these events. Over 3,000 people attended Epping RSL's dawn service and a further 2,000 were at the dawn march held by North Ryde RSL. In addition, the weeks preceding saw thousands more people attending a number of Anzac services at Ryde Ex-Servicemens Club, Gladesville RSL and the Epping cenotaph. All the local RSLs held beautifully moving commemorations and our history, character and heritage were confirmed by so many people attending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention the hard work of the many people involved in organising these events. There are too many individuals to name them all, but I would like to thank in particular the President of Ryde District Sub Branch, Mr Bernie Cox; the Gladesville RSL Club Vice-President, Mr Peter Astridge; the Epping Sub Branch President, John Curdie; and the Epping Sub Branch Secretary, John Prestige. These men and their respective RSL clubs put in the same dedication to service as they had done during the conflicts. I congratulate them all. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bennelong has a close connection to the Anzac legend. Between 1914 and 1918, 2,000 men volunteered from the area that is now covered by Bennelong. At the time, there were a mere 3,500 dwellings in that same region. This level of volunteering was almost unprecedented across the country. Remarkably, these volunteers came in a steady stream throughout the war, barely dipping after the retreat from Gallipoli or during the defeat and stagnation of the Western Front in 1916. This patriotism and bravery is incredible and it is worthy of the huge turnout seen across Bennelong last month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a proud tradition of commemorating Anzac Day in Bennelong, which I would like to briefly explore. The President of the Ryde District Sub Branch, Bernie Cox, has researched the history of the Anzac service itself and made some very interesting discoveries. The Anzac legacy tells us tales of the diggers commemorating the first few anniversaries of the Gallipoli landings from the trenches of the Western Front, but less is less remembered about the origins of the early Anzac services held on Australian soil. It is believed that these first services were held in Martin Place before the Hyde Park Cenotaph was completed in 1936. These initial ceremonies were not full of the military regalia that we see now; they were more modest affairs and were led by just four Sydney ex-servicemens clubs. One was from Lane Cove and another was a now defunct factory in Concord populated largely by demobbed veterans. However, the bulk of the veterans apparently came from two branches local to Bennelong—the Ryde and Eastwood branches. It is believed that Ryde RSL is descended from this group of ex-servicemen who forged the tradition of commemoration that we have recently taken part in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it is not just our excellent local RSL clubs that have been remembering our veterans this Anzac Day. Thanks to the federal government's Anzac Community Grants local schools, charities and other organisations have been able to share in over $100,000 to assist with their commemorations. These grants have gone to a wide range of groups and allowed them to remember the Anzacs in a variety of ways. Indeed, I spoke about one particularly memorable effort—namely, the 'Ryde Goes to War' book compiled by the Ryde District Historical Society—in this place recently. This is an amazing resource for future generations and I again commend its dedicated authors for their incredible work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition a number of schools, including Ryde, Gladesville, Denistone East and Epping public schools, have used the funds to build commemorative gardens or improve existing memorials. Epping RSL Sub-Branch has used their grant to collect together their WW1 memorabilia and display it for the public. And St Albans Parish in Epping has used their grant to restore their memorial to the local soldiers who fought in the First World War. I recently attended the re-opening of the Anzac memorial garden at Gladesville Public School. This garden has been in place for many years to remind students of their forebears who went to both world wars. However, it was overdue for refurbishment and needed some TLC. Last year they applied to my office for an Anzac Centenary Grant and were successful in receiving $18,000 towards their garden. I was honoured to represent the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the event to open the new garden, and the students performed beautifully. An incredible job has been done to create a moving yet practical garden and I congratulate the school and all involved for their excellent work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Centenary of Anzac events will be remembered for decades, particularly with the help of the Abbott government's Centenary Grants. I have visited many of these projects and I look forward to seeing more and congratulating their recipients in the coming weeks and months. Last Sunday I attended a poignant memorial to the soldiers who served in the Battle of Lone Pine 100 years ago. This memorial was held at the Epping RSL and was very well attended. It was especially wonderful to see younger generations in attendance and learning about this pivotal battle in our history. I again commend the Epping club for their special work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a significant year for all Australians. It has been important that we honour our service men and women at an Anzac Day ceremony. I am incredibly proud of the many groups across Bennelong that have pulled out all stops to commemorate Anzac and of the thousands of people who have turned up to take part in the commemorations and remember our brave veterans, and I thank the organisers of these many fantastic initiatives. This year's commemorations have been incredibly special, and I thank everybody who has been involved in making them so. This 100th Anniversary of Anzac is more than just the commemoration of a battle; it celebrates the birth of a legend and the formalisation of our unique Australian identity. Our great sense of mateship, egalitarianism, ingenuity and larrikinism was formed on those battlefields 100 years ago. Mateship is that rare blend of caring, fun loving, freedom, the gentle nature, the devout, the irreverent, the strong and the heroic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bennelong Cup this year has invited two more countries to participate. Along with Korea, China and Japan, Malaysia will also play. To commemorate Anzac, we have invited New Zealand to join us and play as Australasia. It may surprise you that, in the Davis Cup competition at the beginning of the previous century, Australasia competed together—the great Norman Brookes teaming with Anthony Wilding, taking on the world, beating the world and bringing the cup to our shores. In this year of commemorating 100 years of Anzac, it is so appropriate that Australia and New Zealand again team together to play our neighbours and our friends in this region. The motivation behind the Olympic Games was to seek, through engagement in sport, to bring peace between warring groups. The effort of New Zealand and Australia teaming together to engage in sport in our region will seek to do the same. It is interesting to note that the games of tennis and table tennis start at 'love all'.</span>

Although by military standards the 1915 Anzac campaign was a disaster—and an epic one at that—the symbolism of Gallipoli and what those hearty and heroic diggers achieved truly united Australia and Australians like nothing else could have possibly done at the time. Looking back now, we should be not only proud but also thankful—eternally thankful—for the deeds that established the ethos which is held so dear by all who wear a military uniform of our country today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many, if not most, people—certainly generational Australians—have a relative who fought in and possibly never returned from the First World War. The 1914-18 conflict touched so many families, robbing us of a generation of men and forever changing our nation. An ancestor of mine, Maurice Joseph Curran, was one of those who made the ultimate sacrifice. In the words of St John: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 14 October 1922 Maurice's mother, Jane, of Coolamon, signed for his memorial plaque—this memorial plaque—the war medal no-one wanted to receive. Marrar-born farmer Maurice enlisted with his younger brother Jack on 27 March 1916. They, like many others across the Riverina and throughout Australia, no doubt felt a deep sense of obligation to join the war effort after what happened at Gallipoli. News from the Dardanelles over those eight fateful months told the grim tale of the hardship endured, service contributed and loss suffered by the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps following those original landings in the predawn darkness on that momentous day forever burnt into the consciences of bereaved yet grateful nations on either side of the Tasman—25 April 1915.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maurice, of the 36th Battalion, fell during the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium on 12 October 1917, killed in action with three other digger mates when a shell landed amongst them just as they were about to 'hop over'. He was aged just 30. His lifeless body fell against or past his brother Jack, later awarded a Military Medal for bravery as a stretcher bearer. He buried his poor brother and then had the awful duty of writing to his mother in Coolamon and telling her what had happened.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another brother, Leslie William Curran, was recruited during Australia's longest recruiting march—350 miles, from Wagga Wagga to Sydney—in 1915-16. This epic walk will be re-enacted a century on thanks to the efforts of an energetic Southern Highlands group led by Graham Brown, Rhondda Vanzella and OJ Rushton, setting off from Wagga Wagga on 5 September en route to Campbelltown. Les Curran was also awarded a Military Medal, for gallantry at Whiz Farm east of Wytschaete—known to the troops as 'Whitesheet'—on the night of 3 March 1918. They were brave diggers those Currans. Fortunately Les made it home, albeit as an invalid, in 1919 but was well enough to serve in World War II and died aged 64 in Mooroopna, Victoria in 1958. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A memorial plaque was issued after the First World War to the next of kin of all British and Empire service personnel killed. The plaques were made of bronze, and were often referred to as the 'Dead Man's Penny' or 'Widow's Penny' because of their resemblance to the significantly smaller penny coin. There were 1,355,000 plaques issued and 450 tonnes of bronze were used in their production. How very sad! A total of 8,709 plaques went to Australians lost as a result of the Gallipoli campaign. The long casualty list included many Riverina boys—from the foothills of the Snowy Mountains in the east to the red soil plains in the west and everywhere in between—who, in the immortal words of Laurence Binyon:</span>

As a percentage of fallen, this sadly ranks Springdale amongst the highest of any community in the Commonwealth. Another such unfortunate community is Tumbarumba. On Anzac night, Springdale paid tribute to those brave forefathers who served. Beautiful silver pin badges were presented to descendants, many of whom still live in the area. Nearly 250 people came from near and far, cramming inside the small memorial hall, to dine on a sumptuous Springdale roast and have Anzac pudding for dessert. The fare corresponded with that provided in the three farewell functions and the three welcome home dinners held in the very same hall between 1915 and 1920. What a truly memorable evening it was! It was country hospitality at its very best. Vietnam veteran retired Colonel Pat Thorne AM did a splendid job with all the arrangements. The entertainment was simply magnificent—Lachlan Reichstein singing <span style="font-style:italic;">It's a long way to Tipperary</span>, Jenny Kotzur reciting a beautiful French poem and Stephanie Elliott doing a wonderful job with <span style="font-style:italic;">Joan of Arc</span>.</span>

Kapooka commandant Colonel Steve Jobson gave an inspiring address. I intend to table that address at the end of this speech. The RSL Rural Commemorative Youth Choir sang beautifully, and personnel from our city's three defence bases did themselves proud.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lessons learned from our involvement in conflict the world over and which first came to light during that ill-fated Dardanelles foray are that the pursuit of peace often comes at a terrible cost. As a nation, we must always stand ready to protect ourselves and those who rely on us. In commemorating the Centenary of Anzac, Australians and those across the Tasman, our everlasting New Zealand friends, share a unique bond which will forever remain unbroken. People from all countries know, admire and respect the enduring qualities of the Anzacs, the core values of courage, initiative, respect and teamwork.</span>

In keeping the peace, our Air Force, Army and Navy personnel, as well as those wonderful nurses and medical staff, have done us proud. This is why we should always honour their memory on Anzac Day and, indeed, every day, for our way of life has been made possible only because of their sacrifices on our behalf.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249764" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LANDRY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  In the past few weeks we have heard a lot about the special events that have been held to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac. It is 100 years since brave soldiers from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps went ashore at Gallipoli, Turkey, in 1915. In the lead-up to this important centenary, I met many people around the electorate of Capricornia who had their own personal connection to the story of the Anzacs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of them was Rockhampton's Ron 'Tiny' Clark from the Capricornia RSL sub-branch. Tiny showed me his father's medals from World War I. His father, William Malcolm Clark, served in Gallipoli in 1915. According to a commanding officer's diary, it appears William Clark may have been the last or second last wounded soldier to be carried to safety by John Simpson Kirkpatrick and his famous donkey, just before Simpson was killed. Simpson and his donkey became an iconic and heroic symbol of Gallipoli.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this centenary year, I have also learnt about other local soldiers who played a role in the Gallipoli conflict. Among them was a bloke called Albert Tiegs. Private Tiegs enlisted for World War I from Rockhampton. He found himself having a 'good last meal' on board an Australian ship, before climbing into a small boat heading for the beach at Gallipoli. Private Tiegs managed to keep a detailed and fascinating war diary, with a blow-by-blow account of his days spent amid the action as an Anzac.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to inform the Australian parliament that Private Tiegs's war diary has been brought to life in audio and visual form in a new display at the Central Queensland military museum in Rockhampton. Titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gallipoli Experience</span>, this project was supported by a federal government grant to mark 100 years since Gallipoli. Recently, I had the privilege to officially open the project. And I can honestly declare that this display is one of the most moving local tributes to mark the Centenary of Anzac that I have seen. When you enter this display, you take a seat in a small boat and watch a film on a huge screen displaying re-enactments of extracts of Private Tiegs's Gallipoli diary. While sitting in the boat watching the film, you get a heightened sense of what it was like to make your way onto the Gallipoli beach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Central Queensland military museum sits in a historic building that once served as the original Rockhampton military barracks. I commend the work of museum volunteers for their contribution in preserving local war history. Like many non-profit organisations, the volunteers here carry out an important task. Without their enthusiasm, this history and the stories that go with it would be lost. The Central Queensland military museum project was one of 15 projects in Capricornia funded by the federal government to respectfully mark 100 years since Anzac. The projects range from the re-enactment of a troop train journey through Central Queensland, the publication of local history books, the re-enactment of a famous 100-year-old war recruitment photograph, new memorials and the restoration of World War I artillery guns for public display.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most significant events to recognise the Centenary of Anzac was the re-enactment of a troop train journey that took place 100 years ago. The original 1915 steam locomotive embarked from Winton in outback Queensland en route to Brisbane via Longreach, Emerald, Blackwater, Rockhampton, Gladstone and Maryborough. Estimates suggest up to 1,000 people turned out to greet the re-enactment train, which stopped in Rockhampton a few days before Anzac Day this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other key Capricornia projects marking 100 years since Anzac include local history books. In Sarina, the RSL sub-branch received a federal grant of just over $21,000 to publish a local history book about World War I. I have opened a new office to service Sarina, and I was delighted recently to meet Sarina RSL sub-branch Anzac book committee members Gail and Brendan Maguire and Sharon Price. The book they are working on is titled <span style="font-style:italic;">More Than Just a Name</span> and depicts the lives and service history of men and women who served in World War I from the Sarina region. The names were taken from the town cenotaph.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal"> In Rockhampton a $9,268 federal grant went to the Central Queensland Family History Association towards the publication of a local history book titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great War—Stories from Home and Abroad</span>. The book provided an opportunity for families in the Rockhampton district to tell the stories of their loved ones who contributed to the war effort. I was fortunate enough, just before Anzac Day, to officially launch this book at a family history open day. In other Centenary of Anzac projects in my region, nearly $15,000 was given to the Livingstone Shire Council to install plaques at both the Emu Park and Yeppoon Centenary of Anzac commemorative precincts. St Joseph's School, Park Avenue, used a $2,500 grant to create an Anzac memorial at the front of the school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sum of $1,211 went to the Keppel Sands State School P&amp;C to establish a Centenary of Anzac Memorial at the school. St Joseph's School at Clermont received $7,624 for a Centenary of Anzac commemorative walkway. The sum of $16,124 went to restoring and relocating two World War I German artillery guns to the site of the John Leak VC memorial on Rockhampton's riverbank, sited under the Rockhampton Regional Council. The Nebo RSL Citizens Auxiliary received $3,167 towards the restoration of existing honour boards and memorabilia at the Nebo Memorial Hall. The Nasho Combined Central RSL Sub-Branch received $6,050 towards the refurbishment of a World War I German Howitzer artillery gun, held by the Rockhampton Regional Council at the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens. The Capricornia RSL and Rockhampton sub-branch received $6,050 for re-enacting original local World War I recruitment activities. This included re-staging an historic photograph with members of the local community and Capricornia Living History Unit. The sum of $5,631 went to replica uniforms for the Capricornia Living History Unit for Centenary of Anzac commemoration services. There was $3,112 used for a Clermont Historical Centre display relating to an Anzac heroes and heroines exhibition in the Isaac Regional Council. These projects all marked a respectful way to honour the tradition and Centenary of Anzac in Capricornia. Lest we forget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30379" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROAD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  It is with a lot of reverence that I speak about this very, very important commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac. Over the Christmas break, for the first time not having to sit on a harvester, I was able to go for a little bit of a holiday with my wife—self-funded, I might add, just to clarify. My wife and I visited Turkey, including Anzac Cove. Rather than talk about things that I could pull out of an encyclopedia, I thought I might reflect a bit about what it was like to be there, to actually see things that we had only seen pictures of before—to see the Sphinx and to see how daunting it must have been for those who landed on that day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a very cold winter's day. We walked around the battle site of Lone Pine, which was surprisingly peaceful. We were fortunate, as we had taken the time to print out a list of things that happened on particular battle sites, which is available online from the Australian War Memorial. We read from the list while we were at particular battle sites. When we were at Lone Pine, I read that you could not actually walk from one side to the other—which is roughly the size of two tennis courts—after the battle without stepping on the bones or the bodies of the dead. Just reflect on that. In this area the size of two tennis courts—a little bit bigger than this chamber—thousands of Australians and thousands of Turks died.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That had an impact on me, as I thought about the futility of war. We as legislators ultimately have the great and humbling responsibility of committing Australians to battle. Do we do it too hastily? If you think about the enthusiasm of those young men, who thought that they were going off on an adventure, it is important for us now not only to commemorate their service but also to think about how that makes us feel as legislators. I found myself having to pay due respect to every grave as I walked around the battle sites of Gallipoli.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My wife had made the comment that she thought we would tire of it, but in fact we did not. It seemed that every grave needed to be recognised as a person, and as a proud Australian myself but also as a legislator I felt that I owed it to them to read each name, to understand the person. Most of the graves did not say where they were from. They simply had a rank, a name, a battalion and perhaps a date. Some of them had a message. Obviously the families had had a chance to put a message on those graves. There were messages such as 'a dinkum Aussie', 'he died for the flag' and this one, which I thought was very insightful: 'Someday we will understand.' Another said 'answered the call, a cable tells a son was killed at the Dardanelles'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One particular grave that we came across was that of AWA Barber, of the 8th Australian Light Horse, killed on 22 June 1915. What struck us was that it said 'born at Laen, Victoria'. Now, most people do not know where Laen is. In fact, Laen is not really a town anymore; it is more of a district in rural Victoria. It is rural Australia. That was back in the era when people did not have big harvesters; people were farming the country with horses and ploughs. So the population base was rural Australia. The average farm size was 200 acres. It was not 1,000 acres or 25,000 acres, as we see now. Therefore, many of the young men who fought came from those regions. It is quite fitting that, even in the movie that highlighted this for Australians this year, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Water Diviner</span>, the men came from Rainbow, which is in the heart of my electorate of Mallee. But AWA Barber, Alexander 'Watt' Andrew Barber, nicknamed 'Watt', was born in Laen on Christmas Day in 1891—so a very young man—and there I was, a legislator from the Mallee, standing in Gallipoli and looking at the grave of a young man from the Mallee who had ultimately given his life in the cause of freedom but in an immensely futile battle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barber joined up in Warracknabeal as part of the 8th Light Horse Regiment and left Victoria on the ship <span style="font-style:italic;">Star of Victoria</span>. He was fighting in the battle of Walker's Ridge when he sustained extensive injuries as a result of a grenade explosion. There is nothing glorious about the way he died. The way he died was painful. The way he died was tragic. But he did die serving Australia. He was taken down to the hospital area, where he passed away. He was then buried.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We put out his story, just before the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings, in a newsletter that goes right across the Mallee. It is a great thing for members of parliament to have communication with the people they represent, and I often go out and meet people in coffee shops right across the electorate. It costs me a few dollars; I shout people a few coffees. But we do do a good coffee in the Mallee. So, if you are there, by all means come and have one. In one of these coffee shops, a guy came and saw me. He said, 'I'm not really politically motivated. I don't even usually read your newsletter. But I happened to read it a couple of days after I found this,' and he presented to me AWA Barber's matchbox and a letter from AWA Barber that was written the day before he died. This man said that he was astounded that he had recently found all this memorabilia of his great-uncle. To then read about his great-uncle in the newsletter was very moving for him, and it said to him that we have not forgotten. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose I want to make the point that 100 years later, in 2015, Alexander 'Watt' Andrew Barber of Laen is still talked about as an example of sacrifice, in a chamber of the Australian parliament. It is right that we commemorate the tragic battle of Anzac Cove. It is right that we walk around graves and pay tribute to every one—not just one but every one—of those who fought in that battle and in subsequent battles. Tragically, over 100,000 Australians, in battles right across the world, have now given their lives in the cause of freedom. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Anzac commemorations, we always say, 'Lest we forget.' 'Lest' is not a word that we use very much anymore. What does 'lest' mean? I put it to you that 'lest' means 'that we shall not'. It is 'that we shall not forget'. Why? What should we not forget? AWA Barber and the 102,000 Australians who have died right across the world for our freedom are testimony that war is a very blunt instrument for resolving human conflict. It is lest we forget—that we shall not forget—that we as legislators must not rush to war, that we as Australians must not rush to war, and that we should work for peace. Lest we forget. We want a peaceful world, not a world of war and conflict. And the testimony of the 100,000 or more Australians should remind us that our role in parliament is to work towards peace and ensure that their sacrifice is remembered.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  It is a privilege to rise to speak on this commemorative motion about the 100th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli Cove, the Centenary of the Anzac tradition. Anzac Day, April 2015 is one of the most important commemorative events that has occurred in our nation's history and appropriately so. It was the Anzac legend that shaped our nation like no other event before it or since, and 100 years later it is extremely pleasing to see millions of Australians across our nation turn out in such large numbers to remember the sacrifice of an entirely different generation from so long ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that the Anzac and Gallipoli landings be remembered in context. It is an example of epic military failure. It is an example of epic disaster—unquestioned casual treatment of human life by military commanders. It is important that Australians understand, in the modern context, that never again should we treat human life so casually, either in a conflict zone or in our endeavours as a nation more generally. I think people are right to question 100 years later: 'Is this a relevant event?' I think people are right to say: 'What does it mean? What is the sacrifice for? Why did it happen?' These are the questions that are asked by millions of people, as they commemorate that important sacrifice of young men and their families and their women. And I think they are right to answer it and say: 'This was one of the most significant events in Australian military history.' This was one of the most significant events in a young nation's history, because almost an entire generation of people were lost in what ultimately was a fruitless and pointless endeavour. Out of that, of course, came so much courage, so much sacrifice, so much mateship, and so much of the legend that we understand modern Australia to be was forged and born—out of that great adversity and that great disaster that Gallipoli was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, I was so proud of my own community, who turned out in such significant numbers. Outside of the Sydney Basin, I believe it was probably the biggest single event—there were almost 25,000 or 30,000 people at the commemorative service in my electorate. I was very proud of the Centenary of Anzac committee that I put together. It was chaired by Colonel Don Tait, who worked tirelessly and in fact put in one of the first applications in the nation to put together a program of significant events that would ensure the whole community shared in the story and learned from the experience and benefited. Twenty-one events were conducted in the Centenary of Anzac program. They honoured the 22 Anzac veterans from my district who went to Gallipoli as well as the 539 veterans from the Hills district who went to World War I more generally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The logistical management was expertly coordinated. It was extremely well received. There was a Centenary of Anzac children's tour launch. There was a film displayed at the events cinema. There was a Lego display which was actually really profound. There was a recruiting centre. The launch in our district was officially done by the New South Wales Governor, the Hon. David Hurley, and we thank him for attending. There were over 7,000 people at the launch. There was the Centenary of Anzac stage play. We had a Sunday commemoration service, with thousands of people attending, and the stage show and dawn service were attended by about 30,000 district people. It was a major program, expertly managed by Colonel Don Tait, who has his own very proud record of military service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the many people who worked tirelessly who never did get thanked, especially from the Castle Hill RSL sub-branch, including David Hand, Barry Newman, John Payne, Sjouke Havenaar, David Cronan, Mike Yeo, Des Brady, Brian Walters, Graham Handley, Chas Naylor, Jeff Lowe, Peter Westwood, Allan Roderick, Ron Smith, Mike Lee, Claude Zavattaro, Barry Russ, Phil Evenden, Robbie Duncan, Bill Dokter and Eva Want. All of these people made great contributions and worked around the clock for the better part of a year to 18 months, giving up their time selflessly. And almost all of those people are veterans of conflicts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take some time to pay great tribute to some particular people from the Hills district who served during the First World War. Septimus James Lewis, of Castle Hill, was a farmhand before enlisting on 16 September 1914, aged just 19, in the Australian Imperial Force, where he served with the 13th Infantry Battalion and was part of the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. On 30 March 1917 he was wounded in the chest, and he was returned to Sydney on 19 September 1917. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">George Sidney Cook, of Baulkham Hills, enlisted in the AIF in August 1914. He joined 2nd Battalion, H Company and embarked for war on 18 October 1914. In his military career he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. In addition, Cook was the son of Australian Prime Minister Joseph Cook, an interesting bit of local history that many locals know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keith Wemyss MacKenzie, of Rouse Hill, was an accountant before enlisting in the AIF in January 2015 and joining 17th Battalion, B Company.  By February 1917 he had been promoted to captain. He was awarded the Military Cross and Bar, the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.  </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We remembered not just those significant veterans but all of the veterans—including the 22 Gallipoli veterans, only eight of whom survived—from the Hills district. We remembered all of those who served in World War I. In the commemoration of Anzac, we also recognised the service and the sacrifice of all the brave men and women who serve our nation. Military service is unique and it is a great service to our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is perhaps one of the most important commemorations in our nation's history, and it is vital that we continue the trend that we have in Australia of encouraging our future generations to continue to remember important matters like this that have shaped and guided our nation's development. I know those 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds—even younger in many cases, where they forged their ages—who went to war would be so grateful to us today, 100 years later, for the fact that we did stop, pause and remember their service and their sacrifice and that we did say to our future generations that we need to continue remember the bravery, the courage and the sacrifice of so many people. It is not because we glorify war, not because we think that Gallipoli was a great success—we remember it was a great disaster; we remember it was a great military disaster; we remember it was a great spectacle of human misery and chaos—but because out of it was forged the great tradition of mateship and courage, of people working for their mates and for each other, of people who were prepared to give up their lives for one another in that great tradition of Australian mateship, where we look out for each other, even under the worst, the most difficult of circumstances. That is something worth remembering for another 100 years.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WHITELEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  It is an honour to speak today on behalf of the people of Braddon in support of the Prime Minister's motion of remembrance and commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac. As a parliament we are acknowledging that 25 April 2015 marked 100 long years since Australian and New Zealand troops landed at Gallipoli, and we do pay our respects to the 60,000 Aussies who fought in the Gallipoli campaign, including the nearly 9,000 who died, the 20,000 who were wounded and the thousands more who carried the unseen scars for the rest of their lives. We do remember the brave soldiers of Great Britain, France, India and Newfoundland who fought alongside the Anzacs 100 years ago. We do note that on 25 April solemn services of remembrance were conducted at Anzac Cove and Lone Pine in Turkey, and they were attended by some 8,000 Australians, including the widows of Australian veterans. We extend our thanks today to the people and the government of Turkey for their support of the centenary commemorations and their ongoing faithful care of the battlefields of Gallipoli. We do note today that on Anzac Day millions and millions of our fellow Australians in each one of our electorates gathered to remember the Anzacs and all those who have worn our uniform and served in the name of Australia. The people of every electorate are represented in this parliament and they honour this milestone of the centenary of the landings at Gallipoli. I have previously in this parliament echoed the words of the Prime Minister. I have recalled the valour, the heroism, the horror, the pain and the sacrifice of all those who have served this nation in peacetime and in war, and I have focused particularly on the conflict at Gallipoli. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1916 an 18-year-old young Methodist farmhand from Longford enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. His name was William Henry Mason. Whilst Longford is in the electorate of Lyons—the electorate of my colleague Mr Hutchinson—William Henry Mason was in fact my grandfather. It is wonderful how over many years all of us, all Australians, have had access to the phenomenal support services of the Australian War Memorial. With the technology available, each and every one of us is capable of discovering little bit by little bit the minutiae of the details of our relatives and friends and neighbours and leaders—where they served, on what days, when they went into hospital, why they went into hospital, whether they were seriously ill. My own grandfather, as I read the records I have here in front of me, certainly had his ups and downs as a member of the Australian Imperial Force. He was in and out of hospital, convalescing in England and then in France—it went on and on. Thankfully my grandfather quite obviously survived. I am sure that each of my colleagues across the parliament can sell stories of their own relatives and friends and neighbours. That is what makes this opportunity to speak so very special for us all—we are all linked not that far back to the story of Anzac. A hundred years may seem a long time, but really it is only three generations for many of us. This is an exceptional opportunity for us to speak not only about our own family lineage and its connection to either World War I or any other war but also in an honourable way on behalf of our electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, following the Centenary of Anzac that we celebrated just a few months ago, I want to direct my few remaining remarks to the many ex-service men and women throughout the north-west of Tasmania, the west coast and King Island who worked tirelessly for a year or more to ensure that the many thousands of people who turned out on Anzac Day 2015 to commemorate the centenary could do so in a respectful manner that was worthy of the remembrance our forefathers deserved. Like all other members of this parliament and all other community leaders, I attended multiple services. I suspect that all of us as local members wished we had cardboard cut-outs of ourselves or genetically modified replicas so that we could have been in every spot in every electorate—that might not be the case in some of the inner suburbs, but in rural and remote areas where we had 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 Anzac Day services it was physically impossible to be at them all. But I attended a number, commencing of course with the dawn service and moving through the day right through into the afternoon. What a tremendous opportunity to fellowship with all the people of Braddon as we came together for an hour or so on one day of a given year to be on the same page—across party lines, across political lines, across religious or cultural lines—to remember together those who have served.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did especially enjoy my time at the Devonport service, the Somerset civic service, the Burnie service and the North Motton service. Each of the services were unique, yet similarly moving. The older generation remembered their own service in some of the wars that we are aware of. They remembered the sacrifice of their mates. Many of them are now physically struggling to even attend the services, but they are both stubborn and courageous and wanted to be there no matter what the sacrifice or the pain. Middle-aged men and women thought of their parents. Young children, schoolchildren, proudly took part in the services through speech, song, poem and readings—and they rose to the occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been an honour, since my election, to work with many of the local RSLs, in particular, and some other community groups to utilise the Anzac Centenary grants to upgrade existing memorials and, in some cases, to erect the first and only memorial in an area; to assist schoolchildren in their remembrance of this great anniversary; and to see taxpayer money well and truly spent in honour of those that have gone before us—some of the best taxpayer money that I suspect has ever been spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the special aspects of the new memorials is that while they may not be on the grand scale that you would expect to see in a capital city or a major regional town, they are no less meaningful—and they came about using local creativity and input. In finishing, I want to give a couple of examples. There was the small community of Tullah on the west coast—the mining area—of Tasmania, which placed a very small but memorable memorial using large boulders around a flagpole, with plaques commemorating local servicemen and servicewomen. And there was the Gunns Plains community, which repaired honour boards and also built a chair—a seat—in a beautiful setting, which can be used by anyone to take a moment to reflect on the sacrifice of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the House for the opportunity to pause in the robustness of this place to remember the courageous service of those that have gone before us.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order. The motion moved by the Manager of Opposition Business seeks to suspend the standing order that is relevant to that ruling. It is perfectly within order for the Manager of Opposition Business to put before the House the motion that he has. What is before the chair is that the Leader of the House has moved that the Manager of Opposition Business be no longer heard. You actually put that to the House and had a vote on it, and I believe we are about to call for a division on that, and that is what should occur before the House right now; otherwise, it is subverting the will of the House. It is perfectly in order at any time for the House to control its own destiny, which is why we have moved, through the Manager of Opposition Business, a suspension of standing orders, including that suspension of standing order 47(c). </span>

                  </a>  No, I don't. I want to assert the primacy of members of this parliament over the conduct of this parliament. That is what I want to assert. It is a very important principle. In practice, the clock is ticking on the 25-minute time limit for the suspension that has been moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, but it is a very important principle that at any time people are allowed to take actions in accordance with the procedures that are allowed for in this House. What would not be appropriate now and in the past would be if a member were interrupted while they were speaking to move a suspension, but it is perfectly in order to interrupt in between speakers to move a suspension, including a suspension of the standing order that provides for the suspensions of standing orders to be ordinarily conducted at a change of business. That is the normal procedure. But given that there is no change of business envisaged before the parliament with the current item that is before the parliament until it concludes at 5 pm is why the opposition have taken this decision. </span>

                  </a>  Mr Second Deputy Speaker, I think, for the elucidation of the opposition and for the House, the reason why oppositions routinely move such suspensions at nine o'clock, straight after prayers, for example, is that it is before the business of the day has begun. That is the reason why members of the opposition have done that. As a Manager of Opposition Business in the House myself in the past and as a member of the opposition, it was always my understanding that if there was to be a suspension of standing orders moved it needed to be between two items of government business, and nine o'clock was the usual time. The fact is that it was not done when a speaker sat down and before the next speaker got up in the middle of an item of business. I am sure the opposition want to fulminate about this matter. My suggestion is that they do so at the appropriate time, and that is when there is a change-over of items of business. I think you have made the right call, Mr Second Deputy Speaker, and the government supports you in it. </span>

                  </a>  Mr Deputy Speaker, to the point of order, if I can make a further submission in light of what the Leader of the House has just said. The Leader of the House has just referred to ordinary routine. There is nothing routine about what the House is dealing with right now. Nobody had any way of predicting that the commissioner would engage himself in Liberal Party fundraising, and the House has to have the right to be able to debate that issue. This is completely without precedent and the House must be allowed to suspend the relevant standing order to have that debate. As we are told a free and open flowing debate is what is meant to happen, it should be happening right now. This is the one way for it to occur. We moved the suspension of that very standing order and the House must be allowed to have this debate. It must not be used by the Leader of the House to cover up the head of a royal commission engaging in Liberal Party fundraising.</span>

I think that that would be unwise. My suggestion to them is that, if they wish to pursue this, they should do so at the next changeover of business, which I assume is two o'clock. If they wish to do it at question time, we can have the debate then, entirely as they wish to do so. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  On Saturday afternoon, I went to a small rural community in my electorate called The Sisters. There, there was an incredibly moving commemoration to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Lone Pine. As most in this chamber and in the general community will know, the Lone Pine battle was an incredibly important battle in the history of the Anzac conflict. In total, 2,277 Australians lost their lives in the Battle of Lone Pine. The total Ottoman death toll was between 5,000 and 7,000. The Lone Pine battlefield was named for a solitary Turkish pine that stood there at the start of the fighting. The tree was situated near the centre of the eastern line of the Australian and New Zealand trenches around Anzac Cove. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An hour-long bombardment of the Turkish trenches at 4.30 pm on 6 August 1915 preceded the main charge. Packs had been dumped to the rear and each man wore a white armband or a piece of white material attached to his back. This was to help tell friend from foe in the close fighting that would soon be upon them in the Turkish trenches. Attacking battalions—the 2nd, 3rd and 4th battalions, all from New South Wales—packed into the Anzac forward positions. At 5.30 pm, the whistles blew and, as the rays of the evening sun shone into the eyes of the Turkish defenders, the Australians rose and charged. The Turks were taken by surprise—Australian forces against formidable entrenched Turkish positions, sections of which were securely roofed over with pine logs. In some instances, the attackers had to break in through the roofs of the trench systems in order to engage the defenders. The main Turkish trench was taken within 20 minutes of the initial charge, but this was the prelude to four days of intense hand-to-hand fighting, resulting in 2,277 Australian casualties. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fighting at Lone Pine for both sides during these Turkish counterattacks was all about throwing bombs across hastily erected barriers, dashing around corners in trenches, and getting off a few rounds at the shapes of advancing men, slipping over the dead and avoiding the dying and wounded. General Birdwood later reported:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The boys went right through these Turkish works, and had regular hand to hand fights every yard. To show you the nature of the fighting I may mention that in one corner we came across eight Turks and six Australians, all dead, who had evidently fought it out man to man to the last.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the important things which occurred after the Battle of Lone Pine was that soldiers grabbed pine cones from that last lone pine, which was destroyed in the battle. It is quite extraordinary that, from the pine cones which were returned from that lone pine in Gallipoli, two direct descendants of that tree stand in the electorate of Wannon. One stands in the Warrnambool Botanic Gardens and the other stands at The Sisters, this small rural community in Western Victoria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, the community from The Sisters gathered to mark the 100th anniversary. They did so under the direct descendant of that lone pine. As the sun went down, the community commemorated. It was incredibly moving. Archie was there. From the time it was planted, Archie watered the lone pine seedling with his brother. Archie told me that he remembered ensuring every day after school that the seedling was properly nourished so that it could grow into the tree that it is today. He stood proudly as a contributor to the commemoration not only as someone who ensured that that lone pine continues to signify what occurred in Gallipoli 100 years ago but as someone who fought in the Second World War. He fought for us to defend our way of life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eric Bogle came along and played a song. Before he played the song, he talked about how he came to write it. He came to write it because he wanted to commemorate what had happened at Lone Pine 100 years ago, but he did not quite know how to do it. The words came to him after he attended the funeral of a veteran who fought in the Second World War. When he went to that funeral, the children of the veteran spoke of the horrors of war that their father had been through. He had always said to them how fortunate he was to have survived when so many around them had lost their lives. They said that their father always said to them, 'Every day you wake up, be grateful for the fact that you are alive, still living and you have a day to live.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the theme of the song that Eric Bogle sang on a Saturday afternoon at The Sisters with the sun going down, with 400 people gathered around the Lone Pine to commemorate not only what our soldiers did on that day at the Battle of Lone Pine but also what they did on the shores of Gallipoli to keep our nation safe and to ensure that the liberties that we hold so dear continue today. If we have any say in it, those liberties will continue for many days to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the commemoration of the 100th celebration of the Anzac campaign has been something that this nation can be truly proud of. Nothing has given me greater pleasure than to ensure, through the grant scream which the federal government put in place, that all the memorials that we have in the electorate of Wannon now stand as a proper tribute to the service that our Anzacs gave 100 years ago. Also, there are the additional commemorations which were able to occur as a result of what we did through providing that funding. Right across the electorate of Wannon, I have attended moving ceremonies and seen the local community ensure that the legend of the Anzacs will continue for another 100 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is the true testament of what we are doing here in these speeches today and through the actions the government are taking to commemorate Anzac, the Anzac spirit and all that the Anzacs did. That is because if we do not continue to remember the sacrifices that have been made and the reasons as to why they were made, we are letting those people down who fought for us, who gave up their lives for us and who gave the most important sacrifice that anyone can give. They were prepared to lay down their life to defend our nation and our way of life. It has been an honour to speak on this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  Before I speak on the Prime Minister's motion regarding 100th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli, I congratulate my friend, colleague and electoral neighbour, the member for Wannon, for his fabulous contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 60,000 Australians lost their lives during the First World War. The survivors met the war's end with a mixture of relief that the fighting was over and deep sorrow at the loss of so many friends and comrades. At the time, Australians celebrated; but in homes across the country people reflected on the terrible losses and mourned those who would not be returning. Today, I wish to highlight the contribution to that operation at Gallipoli of three individuals who came from my electorate of Barker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born in Mount Gambier, Frank Edmund Allchin worked as a clerk before enlisting on 21 August 1914, at the age of 20, in the Australian Imperial Force's 10th infantry battalion. Prior to leaving for the war, Allchin was sent off by the local community, including the local football club and boy's institute, which presented him with hairbrushes and a wallet. On 20 October 1914, he embarked from Adelaide aboard HMAT <span style="font-style:italic;">Ascanius</span> as part of the first convoy to depart Australia for the war. He wrote home about his experience on the troopship and in Egypt prior to landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Allchin recounted the morning of the landing in a letter published in a local Mount Gambier newspaper. He wrote: 'You have no doubt heard all about our landing. It was early morning, and what a baptism of fire we had. All day long the battle raged, the din being awful. By nightfall, we had taken up a position which entitled us to say we had established a footing.' Just over a fortnight after the landing at Gallipoli, Allchin was promoted to sergeant. Later in the campaign, Allchin also wrote home in October to thank the Red Cross Society for parcels of socks sent to the troops. He added that: 'We here at the front are cheered and encouraged when we know you are all doing so much to help us, and so while everyone is doing their little bit there can be no doubt that the ultimate result will be victory for the Allies.' Allchin remained on the peninsula with the 10th Battalion until 22 November.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having moved to the Western Front in early May 1917, Allchin was serving near Bullecourt in France and at great personal risk spent many hours under enemy fire repairing communication lines between the battalion and brigade headquarters. His commanding officer especially noted that: 'His courage and cheerful devotion to duty at all times was a splendid example to his men.' Accordingly, he recommended Allchin for the military medal, which was conferred on 17 July 1917. Thankfully, Allchin returned to Australia on 27 January 1919.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born in Kersbrook on 26 March 1890, Avelyn Clarence Dunhill spent his early years in Orroroo before making his way to Renmark, where he was employed as a bookkeeper. Prior to the war, Dunhill was an active member of the community brass band and a competitive rifle shooter. Dunhill was reportedly one of the first recruits from Renmark in 1914 and formally enlisted on 26 August as part of the AIF's 10th infantry battalion. Less than two months later, he embarked aboard HMAT <span style="font-style:italic;">Ascanius</span> and left Adelaide as part of the first convoy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dunhill wrote back to the local Renmark newspaper from the troopship describing the journey and then later from the AIF camp in Egypt, where he noted that: 'So far all the Renmark boys … are in very fair trim, and I think have managed to keep their end up pretty well.' Having landed at Gallipoli on 25 April, he was wounded by a bullet in the thigh less than two months later and was evacuated to Alexandria. Writing back home from hospital there, he noted that he had been looked after 'tiptop' and mentioned that the Sultan of Egypt had recently made an inspection tour of the hospital. Having rejoined his Battalion in mid-July, he remained on the peninsula until late December. While in the final months of the Gallipoli campaign, Dunhill reported back in a letter of the custom of distributing care packages among the platoon, including in one instance a pound of Australian butter that was described as 'luxury from the gods'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In early 1916 Dunhill transferred to the 50th Battalion and commenced the rest of his campaign on the Western Front, having been promoted to lieutenant the previous November. In early July 1918 Dunhill was leading a patrol at Hamel which embarked on attacking an enemy post. Despite a failed first attempt Dunhill regrouped to lead a second charge, in which he himself was wounded. His commanding officer praised Dunhill's initiative, through which 'the success of the enterprise was entirely due to this officer's gallantry and tenacity'. For this action he was also awarded the Military Cross.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having been transferred to hospital in England, Dunhill wrote letters of thanks for a care package received and especially recognised the role of Australia's women on the home front, stating that 'they are the ones who are having the greatest influence in this European show.' He acknowledged that:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The sitting still, waiting and wondering is considerably harder to stick than the life we lead with its constant change and excitement. Ours is really a poor part alongside of that borne by the women whose spirit is the thing which to a very good extent keeps all going with a good head.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dunhill, thankfully, returned to Australia again in June 1919.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 December 1915, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Southern Cross</span> Adelaide newspaper reported the experience of military chaplain Reverend Daniel Francis McGrath while at Gallipoli. Born in Tipperary, Ireland, in February 1873, Reverend McGrath lived in Naracoorte, where he had been a member of the defence club since 1906. He embarked from Melbourne aboard HMAT Karroo on 20 October 1914 and served at Gallipoli attached to the AIF's 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Southern Cross</span> newspaper article, Reverend McGrath specifically describes his unique experience of celebrating mass in the Gallipoli trenches prior to departing to Alexandria for hospital duty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The war correspondent and journalist, CW Bean, is credited with helping create the Anzac legend that has gone on to become the cornerstone of our national identity. His dispatches from Gallipoli gave vivid insight into the comradeship, tribulations and humour that pervaded the lines in this terrible battle, and allowed those mothers, fathers, sisters and younger brothers back home a window to view the character of the men who fought bravely on that thin strip of land in a faraway place. It is almost exclusively through his firsthand, eyewitness reporting that we know so much about the nature of the conflict we participated in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That would have been an important legacy in its own right, but Charles Bean made another important contribution to Australia: he was a driving force behind the establishment and design of the Australian War Memorial and the deeply-held belief Australians have to this day that those who have made the supreme sacrifice in war should be honoured and remembered forever more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bean had hoped that there would never be another conflict of the order of the First World War. Sadly, this was not to be the case. Since the end of that war in 1918, Australians have time and again gone to faraway places to fight tyranny and oppression, and to protect our way of life. Instinctively, we are suspicious of grandiose schemes that seek to put our men and women in harm's way. This is a suspicion resulting largely from our searing experience on the Gallipoli Peninsula a hundred years ago, where our men made an enormous contribution for seemingly little gain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike some of the countries we have fought alongside, our nation is not one born of calamitous conflict but of peaceful democracy. If given our preference, the most intense of our clashes would occur on the sporting field rather than the battlefield; yet we have never failed to play our part to help defend the freedoms we enjoy, and which we hope to see others enjoy as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of our views on the merits of particular conflicts, the Australian community must always recognise that the soldiers, sailors, airmen and women and nurses who go forward to defend our nation do so because they earnestly believe it is in the best interests of our nation that they do so, and because they want to ensure that their families and the communities in which they live are safe from whatever peril may threaten our shores. By continuing to remember those who have served in the past and by honouring those who are serving today, we ensure that their legacy will live on forever.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  The Anzac story is the glue of our nation. A belief in mateship and rugged resourcefulness built this nation. At the 100-year mark, it is important to reflect upon the importance of that time and event then and now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australia, as for many nations, the First World War remains the most costly conflict in terms of deaths and casualties. From a population of fewer than five million, 416,809 men enlisted, of which over 60,000 were killed and 156,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner. The outbreak of war was greeted in Australia, as in many other places, with great enthusiasm. In response to the overwhelming number of volunteers, the authorities set exacting physical standards for recruits. Yet, most of the men accepted into the army in August 1914 were sent first to Egypt, not Europe, to meet the threat which a newly belligerent Ottoman Empire—now Turkey—posed to British interests in the Middle East and the Suez Canal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australians landed at what has become known as Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 and established a tenuous foothold on the steep slopes above the beach. During the early days of the campaign, the allies tried to break through Turkish lines, while the Turks tried to drive the allied troops off the peninsula. Attempts on both sides ended in failure and the ensuing stalemate continued for the remainder of 1915. As a result, the Turks were unable to inflict more than a very few casualties on the retreating forces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In modern parlance, Gallipoli was a game changer. It changed the attitudes of the young men fighting and those at home. It consolidated a belief in the idea of a separate Australian identity. It showed how victory can be pyrrhic, and retreat a success. It demonstrated the changed and complex reality of war—quagmire, morale and operational factors were now in the minds of the millions. Every club, community and country, for it to be successful and enduring, needs a unifying foundational narrative, and 25 April 1915 marks a pivotal moment in Australian history. The Australian troops who stormed ashore as part of the allied landing force on the morning of 25 April were the newly-minted Anzacs, formed in Egypt only a few months before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About 420,000 Australians enlisted for service in the war; almost 40 per cent of the eligible male population. This was the first time Australians had been exposed to the bloody horrors of 20th century trench warfare, and our young nation recoiled. Despite the savage introduction, something precious was salvaged from disaster. Gallipoli showed us what they were made of—and it is something to be proud of. It was because of the way in which the Australians performed, not their strategic achievements, that the Anzac legend was born. The Anzac Gallipoli legend says to us that such is our love of country and upright decency that we would literally go to the ends of the earth to defend our view of what is right and our way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Gallipoli the legacy of the campaign is clear. The landscape still bears the marks of trenches and artillery bombardments and there are 44 separate war cemeteries. The cemeteries honour the dead of all those nations that fought in Gallipoli but, due to the nature of the fighting and the complexity of recovering bodies during the campaign, the vast majority of soldiers who died have no known grave. While this ill-fated battle became a touchstone of Australian and New Zealand nationhood the British chose to forget the 'disgraceful disaster'. The war changed more than the hands that write history, but reality never does. And while it is right that we remember the valour and bravery of our Anzacs always, it is also right that we remember the context that drove them into war on foreign shores. Every little nation in the family of the British Empire sent its sons to help the then motherland. Our nation was no different. We were and are a part of a family of free countries. The war was about family—families suffering in sacrifice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although he never served in the Australian forces, I would like to honour my maternal grandfather, Bernard Bailey, who fought on the Western Front in World War I—one of the Allies. The attitude of service then was very strong. My grandfather was a bombardier in charge of a howitzer. In those days they had no hearing protection—so he went deaf in one ear as a result of the continual noise. He was medically released from service due to injuries that he sustained during the war. I recall watching him shave in the morning. He was wearing a singlet. He had a huge chunk out of his arm, and I asked him about it. A piece of shrapnel had gone through his arm. It is interesting some of the things they did in those days. Of course, they did not have skin grafts then. He told me what they did to try to prevent infection. They used the skin from hard boiled eggs to form a protective layer to prevent infection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandfather was an interesting character. He was one of the early motorcyclists in the world. He was checking out a nurse when he was on a motorcycle and he crashed. The nurse he was checking out ended up being my grandmother. I was talking about the whole issue of service and the attitudes that people had then. My grandfather was not a large man. He was only five foot six inches tall. My uncle, during World War II, was not particularly interested in serving. My grandfather was really ashamed of this. So imagine this: here was a man who was around 50. At that stage he was blind in one eye because of a lazy eye and he was deaf in one ear. And he had a big chunk out of his arm due to war injuries. And he went to try and enlist! Of course, they did not accept him, but it had the desired effect: my uncle did then enlist. However, my uncle, different from my grandfather, never spoke about his experience in World War II in North Africa.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really regret the fact that my grandfather died when I was only 14 years old. I would have liked to have him around a lot longer. The stories that he told were quite chilling but also very memorable. For example, he told stories of the trenches—and I imagine the same thing would have happened in Gallipoli. He said the rat infestation in the trenches was terrible and they used to have competitions to see who could kill the most rats. That was one of the ways the comraderie built up in awful circumstances. It makes me think back to those men on the Gallipoli shore and the terrible conditions they had. There was a great probability of them dying of injuries the majority of which today would not be a death sentence but were then because of inadequate drugs and inadequate medical treatment. The courage of those men in facing that persistent and consistent danger day after day beggars belief. In a lot of battles since, there is what is called manoeuvre warfare: you have a battle but, after that, things do not move; you have large periods where essentially nothing happens. But at Gallipoli and on the Western Front it was just day after day after day. So I salute all of those Anzacs who served not only at Gallipoli but throughout World War I. I thank them for their sacrifice and the soul they brought to this nation called Australia.</span>

                  <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I am honoured to have the opportunity to speak in this House on the sacrifices of the greatest Australians and on the events in my electorate to commemorate them. Before discussing the local commemorations on Anzac Day in my electorate, it is important to reflect on why those commemorations took place. I was born in the 1970s. To be born in the 1970s in Australia is to draw a tremendous hand from fate: our lives have been free and secure. Fascists have not murdered us. Communists have not enslaved us. Tyrants have not set one group of us against another. Criminals have not locked us up. We have not been killed because of our race. We have not been imprisoned because of something we wrote. We have not had to risk our lives to practice our faith. We have not had to meet in secret to talk about what we believe. We have not had to pay a corrupt official to get a job. We have not had break the law to provide for our family. We have been allowed to be our true and best selves. These things are true in our nation for two reasons: firstly, we have had the wisdom to know that there is nothing more important than freedom; and, secondly, we have had the courage to fight for it. That courage has been shown by generations of Australians, but nowhere more than at Gallipoli.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our area, we commemorated the extraordinary events of Gallipoli through many local functions. On behalf of our community, I would like to thank the hundreds of people who were directly involved in organising these events, and the many thousands who attended. The largest commemoration in my community was held at Oatley, with at least 5,000 people in attendance for the dawn service. It was organised jointly by the RSL sub-branches of Oatley, Penshurst and Mortdale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day commenced with a performance by the St George group of Sing Australia in advance of the dawn ceremony. Though there were thousands of people in attendance, the atmosphere was one of quiet reflection. During the service, Sing Australia members gave a moving rendition of the national anthem. The group's conductor, Hayden Bowles, also sang a solo performance of the New Zealand national anthem, which was a moving and dignified tribute to the role of that great nation at Gallipoli. Thank you to everyone at Sing Australia for what you did on that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The service itself was extremely well organised by the local sub-branches, and I would like to pay tribute to them today. There were too many people involved to name them all but, in particular, I would like to pay tribute to the chairman of the organising committee, John Hoban; the President of Oatley RSL Sub-Branch, Mike Tiddy; and the President of the Mortdale RSL Sub-Branch, John Delaney. These gentlemen are all very well known in our community for their local service, and that commitment was to the benefit of all of us on Anzac Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the local community organisations that helped to make the Oatley services on Anzac Day so successful. My part of Sydney is very fortunate to have strong and active Lions clubs, and these clubs ran a very popular sausage sizzle after the dawn service concluded. Thank you to everyone from the Lions Club of Lugarno, the Oatley Lions Club, and the Georges River Lioness Club for making this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Riverwood, the Riverwood legion ex-services club and Club Rivers held a joint service later in the morning, which I was fortunate to attend. A moving video tribute to Australian soldiers was played, and the young men from the Riverwood Australian Air League band performed exceptionally well, as they always do. I would like to thank Dick Matthews, the president of Riverwood legion ex-services club, for all of his efforts in organising this event. In addition, President Michael Free and CEO Stuart Jamieson from Club Rivers deserve thanks for the substantial effort they put into organising this important event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Several other events were held on this most important day. At St George Masonic Club, a service was held commemorating the service of Australian and New Zealand soldiers, which I attended in the afternoon. I thank the club for organising this event, and I also thank Mr Ron Haira, the honorary president of New Zealand Veterans in Australia, for attending this ceremony. Club Grandviews is an important part of our area, and serves as a hub for my community in the Peakhurst-Lugarno region. Although Club Grandviews is not a service club, it nonetheless pays tribute to our fallen soldiers through a service each year on Anzac Day. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend this year, but I know from previous attendance that it is always a well-organised and well-attended event. Thank you to CEO Paul Nicholls and the club's board for their ongoing commitment to honouring our veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank Padstow RSL sub-branch for the commemorations they held both on Anzac Day and on April 19, the preceding Sunday, which I attended. On April 19, a service was held at the war memorial on Cahors Road, followed by a march to Padstow RSL. At the RSL, a stirring service was held. Numerous local children performed, and the assembled crowd heard a powerful address on the nature of sacrifice. I would like to thank Padstow RSL Sub-Branch president, Bruce Knox, for organising these events, and for the ongoing leadership he provides to our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge Bill Wright of Oatley RSL, who prepared a remarkable publication to commemorate the centenary of Anzac Day. Mr Wright, through research over a number of years, compiled a list of veterans from the Oatley area who had served in the First World War, and then he had the persistence and dedication to put that all together in the form of a book. The book talks about the men who served in the First World War and it is an important commemoration to their extraordinary service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anzac Day is a very important event every year. This year was an extraordinarily important day. Those of us of our generation are extraordinarily fortunate to live in this country. The burdens and sacrifices that we have been asked of us are, frankly, negligible next to those of previous generations. We would not be here but for them. We must never forget that, and on the centenary of Anzac Day my community came together to remember that very important fact.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great War, as World War I became known, was unlike any previous conflict known to man. On the battlefronts in both the east and west of Europe 19th century military strategy met 20th century technological advances with catastrophic consequences. Around the world more than 65 million marched to war with eight million never to return home. As a young, small country, geographically isolated, and with very strong economic, diplomatic and cultural links to the British Isles, it was natural that Australians saw the defence of England—our greatest ally—as the defence of our own nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 416,000 Australians enlisted, including more than 5,000 men from those suburbs that now make up the electorate of Higgins. Overwhelmingly these men were not professional soldiers but volunteers with limited training. Many women also took an active part in the war, especially as nurses and in taking over jobs on the home front. In remembering the war we honour those people, their sacrifice and that of their families. We also reflect upon their extraordinary bravery, stoicism, fraternal loyalty and service to their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we also reflect upon the lasting effects the war had on entire communities and indeed Western society. However difficult to quantify, there can be no doubt that World War I irreversibly altered the course of modern history; the geopolitical boundaries of Europe; the development of science, industry, medicine and psychiatry; our notions of nationality and patriotism; and indeed our very understanding of humanity itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, as is only appropriate, communities across Australia have been marking this moment in time and reflecting on what it means. In Higgins on the weekend before Anzac Day we held an extraordinary centenary march. The march was attended by·His Excellency the Hon. Alex Chernov AC, QC, Governor of Victoria, accompanied by Mrs Elizabeth Chernov;·   the Stonnington mayor, Councillor Melina Sehr; the Chairman of the Victorian Anzac Centenary Committee, the Hon. Mr Ted Baillieu; the State President of the Victorian RSL, Major General David McLachlan; the Chairman of the Legacy Council of Australia, Mr Ian Harrison; the consuls general from the Turkish embassy and the British and New Zealand high commissions; and the magnificent Creswick Light Horse. Just as importantly, the march was also supported by thousands of individual community members and numerous local organisations including many schools; the Malvern East, Prahran, Toorak and Hellenic RSL sub-branches; and Stonnington City Brass. The weather was unfortunately inclement, but this only served to remind us of the unimaginable hardships borne 100 years ago. Once again I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to retired Lieutenant Colonel David Blackwell, chair of my Centenary of Anzac committee, for his extraordinary efforts in bringing this event to reality; and the members of my very hardworking Anzac centenary committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Higgins Centenary March I was pleased to announce that with the support of my Anzac centenary committee I was able to produce the Anzac Centenary Higgins Memorial Map. The map lists many existing World War I memorials in the Higgins electorate, together with new memorials which have been funded through the federal government's Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. The map has been available to schools and community groups throughout this year to promote those lasting memorials of great service in my electorate of Higgins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also proud that in commemorating the 100th anniversary of the landing of Gallipoli, and in my capacity as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, I was able to launch a new coloured coin, only the fourth in general circulation, as part of the Royal Australian Mint's Official Anzac Centenary Coin Program, where a collection of commemorative coins capture the history, service and sacrifice of Australians at war. This special coin depicts a centrally sculpted and emotive design. It features poppies, symbolic of remembrance, amongst crosses used to honour the fallen and mark the graves of the unknown heroes. Inspired by the poppy, the distinctive and powerful red coloured print encapsulates the solemn words, 'Lest we forget'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as part of the commemorations of the Centenary of Anzac I recently held the Higgins Anzac Centenary School Poetry Competition. The theme of the poetry competition was, 'What does the Anzac Centenary mean to you?' and the panel of judges included Mr Michael Gleeson, editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Progress</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Leader</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Stonnington Leader</span>; representatives of local RSLs; and the Higgins Electorate Anzac Centenary Committee. There were four levels of entry: years 2 to 4, years 5 to 6, years 7 to 9 and years 10 to 12. I was delighted to announce that the winners were Ellie Martin from St Cecilia's Primary School, Narisha Ford from Black Rock Primary School, Gabby Tymms from St Catherine's School and Rafael Ungar from the King David School. This competition was open not only to local schools but also to local residents—hence the winners. I am delighted that the competition was so well subscribed with so many beautiful entries. It clearly gave young people in my electorate an opportunity to focus on making personal connections with the momentous events of one century ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is community events such as these that provide the opportunity for us to pause, recall, reflect and commemorate. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has said, 'Grief is the price we pay for love.' In coming together we remember the grief of family, friends, communities and nations, for lives irrevocably altered and lost and a world forever changed. However, we should also dwell upon love—love for our kin and for our mates and, importantly, our love of peace; not just love for our country and its freedoms, but also the love of a grateful nation. In this centenary year, I pay my respects today to all those who have served, and continue to serve, our nation both at home and overseas. I give thanks for their sacrifice while hoping for a more peaceful tomorrow.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  I rise very humbly to talk about and acknowledge the Centenary of Anzac and obviously the centenary of Gallipoli this year. Anzac Day every year is not just acknowledging people who served at Gallipoli but honouring all those who have served this country over many, many years. But obviously this year there was a focus on the centenary of Gallipoli.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I came across some statistics that I found very sobering. I had heard of both these places, as many of us have, but these statistics really reminded me of why most Australians have heard of these two names. We have all heard of Lone Pine at Gallipoli. It is about the size of a football field. The number of men that were killed there—not just on our side—was 9,000 over the period of this battle, so 9,000 men were killed in an area the size of a football field. That in itself says a lot about why Lone Pine is very much remembered. Another area is the Nek. The Nek is the size of about three tennis courts, so again not a big area. Some 800 Australians attacked the Turkish trenches at the Nek. In one hour, 650 of those 800 men were killed or wounded. Again, we can see why the Nek and Lone Pine are very much remembered in our history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1919, after the war, Australians were sent back to bury the fallen soldiers. One Australian looked over to the Nek from the ridge where he was and saw a large area of white. He did not know what it was as it was not there during the fighting in 1915. It was four years later. He scrambled through the scrub, went across from one ridge to the other, down through a gully, and came out at the Nek. The large area of white was the skeletons of the Australians who were killed in that hour four years earlier. That gives one the stark reality of exactly what we are talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first ashore at Gallipoli is a matter of conjecture. Through anecdotal stories, that role fell to Lismore's Joseph Stratford. On the morning of 25 April, eyewitness accounts describe Stratford plunging into waist-deep water from his landing boat and abandoning his pack to charge up the beach with rifle and bayonet. Less than an hour later, he was dead, having stormed a Turkish machine gun post single-handedly, only to fall riddled with bullets. Stratford's achievement has been eulogised locally and is mentioned in the Australian War Memorial archives but was never officially recognised. However, his memory was honoured with a plaque unveiled at the Lismore Uniting Church. Born at Coffee Camp near Nimbin in 1883, Joseph Henry Stratford was the fifth child in a family of 11. When 23, he left Lismore for the North Queensland cane fields and enlisted in the AIF in 1914. Promoted to sergeant, he was a natural leader and likely candidate to lead such a brave assault. Establishing an official record of exactly who was first ashore at Anzac Cove has always proved impossible. Many drowned or were shot before setting foot on the beach, while those who made it to shore were scattered and in disarray. But several eyewitness letters and verbal accounts mentioning Stratford as the first ashore made the case worthy of official consideration. His great-nephew Colin Stratford said 'it was only ever discussed in the family', but it was acknowledged all the same. He believed that there was enough evidence that Stratford should be recognised as the first man ashore. It is a number of years ago now that the Lismore Uniting Church officially recognised that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The statistics have been mentioned before, but, however horrific they are, they are worth acknowledging. We know that around 60,000 men were killed or wounded during the First World War, and at Gallipoli itself there were many. Our current population would put the statistics at around 250,000 people, which again emphasises how horrific that battle was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the committee that helped me with the centenary of Anzac. There were lots of re-enactments, memorial plaques, displays et cetera through the Anzac grant program. I would like to mention a couple. I had the privilege of going to Copmanhurst two nights before Anzac Day where there was a re-enactment of the Light Horse Brigade. The day before Anzac Day, 150 men and women rode from Copmanhurst to Grafton to be there for the dawn service. It was very moving. When everyone was assembling at Copmanhurst two nights before, I am sure it was very similar to what happened 100 years ago. There was great energy, frivolity, laughter and what have you when everyone was assembling with their horses. While that was happening, we had to remember that people were going to an unknown, and how sad the results were for many of them. Also, I went to the unveiling of a memorial stained glass window at St Andrews Church in Lismore. There were also improvements around the Lismore baths. Some windows and glass doors were put in so that they could be observed all year around. That was particularly moving for my wife Karen, whose great-great-uncle, Alfred Webber, is listed on that memorial plaque as fallen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also an interesting event at Ballina. There is going to be a planting of trees along the avenue and it will be called Waler's Way. As has been well documented, tens of thousands of horses from Australia went to the battle. It is called Waler's Way because the horses were predominantly from New South Wales. Only one returned. A lot of the young men took their horses with them, and not only did they not return but tens of thousands of horses were also involved in the battle. I went to many unveilings as well around the Kyogle-Woodenbong area. The day itself was very moving, as I am sure it was for all of us involved. I went to the dawn service in Ballina. The dawn service is always moving wherever you go and whatever type of day it is, but it was a particularly moving day with a particularly stunning sunrise. I acknowledge everyone involved in that. The service at Lismore later in the morning was also moving, as were those in Casino, Clovass and Coraki.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge everyone on the committee who helped me with those Anzac centenary grants. I obviously pay respect to everyone involved in the conflict. Over this year, because it is the centenary, we have all become more aware of what happened at Gallipoli and the statistics that were involved. As I mentioned at the start, I will never forget that 9,000 men were killed in the area the size of a football field and 650 of 800 Australians were killed or wounded in an area the size of three tennis courts in one hour. We should never forget that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  As the son of a Vietnam Veteran it is a great honour to rise in this House today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli and pay tribute to those who fought in the First World War and those who have served our great nation in subsequent wars and battles. May I take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed overseas as well as the increasing number of recently returned veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father, Reg, was attached to 103 Field Battery during the Vietnam War, where he was involved in the Battle of Long Tan, one of the most significant and bloodiest battles Australia was involved in during the war, that saw 18 Australians lose their lives and 24 wounded. On that fateful night of 18 August 1966, the battery fired for more than five hours under extremely difficult climatic conditions, firing 1,078 rounds, the highest number of rounds fired by any battery during battle, in order to protect D Company, 6 Royal Australian Regiment, who were trapped in a rubber plantation near Long Tan in South Vietnam. My father has never really talked about the war, and he is by no means alone. Most of his mates refuse to talk about it as well, silently carrying the burden of their experiences without solace or support. And of course there are those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice: never returning home to their loved ones. The Centenary of Anzac is an opportunity for all Australians to show our deepest respect and gratitude for the sacrifices that have been made and are being made every day in various locations throughout the world by our service men and women and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gallipoli landings and the establishment of the Australian Imperial Force represent the birth of the Australian military as it stands today—for instance, 103 Field Battery, my father's battery, first formed at Tel-el-Kebir in Egypt on 6 March 1916 as part of the AIF's reorganisation following the Gallipoli campaign. Accordingly, the 100th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli is perhaps the most significant commemorative occasion in our nation's history because of its vital role in establishing us as a nation and as a people. Thanks to the hard work of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Michael Ronaldson, the government has provided the perfect platform to help communities across Australia to reflect upon and venerate the lives and achievements of our Anzacs through the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. I am proud to report that this program has played an integral role in Macarthur's Centenary of Anzac commemorations, providing more than $110,000 in funding to numerous schools and local organisations in my electorate. Rosemeadow Public School was able to build a memorial garden and learning centre thanks to this grant funding, providing the perfect environment for current and future generations of students to learn about the heroic deeds of our Anzacs. I was delighted to join Rod Armstrong, Secretary of the Campbelltown RSL Sub-Branch, at Rosemeadow's Anzac Day ceremony on 23 April to officially open the garden and learning centre. I would like to thank Principal Paul Hughes, Vice-Principal Michelle Lester, Karen Davies, Simon Greenshields and all the staff and students for what was a fantastic event.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wollondilly Shire Council received Anzac Centenary grant funding to build a commemorative wall in Warragamba Civic Park, ensuring that residents in the Warragamba Silverdale area have a dedicated site to remember the fallen. The Warragamba and Silverdale region has a rich and proud Anzac history, with over 47 young men making the journey to Europe to fight in the First World War, including Patrick Sinclair Anderson, who was mortally wounded during the Gallipoli landings in 1915. I was delighted to join Jai Rowell, state member for Wollondilly, Councillor Hilton Gibbs and the Warragamba Anzac Committee in Warragamba Civic Park on 15 April for the official unveiling of this commemorative site. I would also like to give special thanks to Stonehill Stonemasons for their terrific work in creating this fitting tribute to the area's rich Anzac history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Veterans Recreation Centre in Campbelltown used funding to remove an existing Australian pine tree at Dredges Cottage and replace it with a certified lone pine that has been sourced by local horticulturalist and veteran John McDonald. The Veterans Recreation Centre is also preserving or replacing plaques on an existing memorial wall and restoring and reframing memorabilia photos and a painting dating back to World War I. I had the pleasure of visiting Dredges Cottage to have a look at these items on display and I am pleased to report that these historical artefacts make a significant contribution to Macarthur's historical record. The Veterans Recreation Centre has also assisted Lauren Hokin in receiving federal support to write a book detailing the sacrifices and experiences of locals who enlisted to fight in the Great War.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Camden Community Connections, a local not-for-profit organisation based in Narellan, hosted a picnic and poetry competition that involved schools across Macarthur. They also produced a DVD called <span style="font-style:italic;">Camden Anzacs: Our Stories </span>that tells the stories of local Anzacs who served in World War I. The Anzac Centenary Community Picnic was a huge success, with hundreds of people flocking to Curry Reserve in Elderslie, where it was held on Sunday 26 April. I would like to congratulate the two poetry competition winners, Hermione Kiley, from Wollondilly Anglican College, and Taylor Skinner, from St Helen's Park School, for the moving recitals they made that day. I would also like to thank Sue Robinson and all her staff and volunteers for their hard work to make the picnic such an enjoyable and successful occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another benefactor of this fantastic program is the St Paul's Anglican Church at Cobbitty, which has received funding to restore a memorial plaque specific to World War I combat that was produced in memory of those who gave service and sacrificed their lives in the Great War between 1914 and 1919. This program also provided support for the Camden Show Society in conjunction with Camden RSL Sub-Branch to hold a military tattoo to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac. Each year over 40,000 people from across the region attend the Camden Show, and this year was made even more special because of the way Camden's war history was commemorated through the production of the military tattoo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Macarthur are incredibly proud of the men and women from the region who served this country during World War I. This was demonstrated by the enormous crowds at Anzac services right across Macarthur this year. The official estimate for the Camden RSL Sub-Branch dawn service was 12,000 people, an unprecedented crowd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A special highlight at Camden's dawn service was Vicki Katon's idea to make a poppy quilt. Sub-branch President Iain Richard-Evan put an advertisement in the local paper asking for interest in helping to make a quilt. Many individuals and organisations in the community helped out, with the residents of Camden Downs Retirement Village making a significant contribution to the quilt. Over 6,000 poppies were knitted, and the poppy quilt was presented at the Camden dawn service. I would like to pay tribute to Susan Young, from Camden Country Quilters Guild, who took a wreath over to Gallipoli to honour the Anzac Centenary. I would also like to thank Camden RSL President Iain Richard-Evan, Senior Vice-President Con Diomis, Andy Wright, Stephen Hunt, Len Carter and Major David Brown, with special thanks to Vicki Katon and Diane Richard-Evan, for the Camden Poppy Project, Emma Robilliard and Mayor Lara Symkowiak from Camden Council.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Ingleburn RSL Sub-Branch dawn service more than 5,000 people packed into the sub-branch's Memorial Garden and Sister Helen Haultain Memorial Park. Thirty-one schools were represented, along with four preschools, various church organisations, the scouts, military cadets, members of the Defence Force and local politicians and dignitaries. A good friend of mine, Pat McGeown, a well-known and respected radio announcer who also happens to be a member for the Ingleburn RSL Sub-Branch and ex Defence Force member, emceed the event. I would like to pay tribute to President Ray James, Vice-Presidents Patrick O'Grady and John Bow, Secretary John Lees, Honorary Treasurer John Beer and everyone involved with the Ingleburn RSL Sub-Branch for making this year's Anzac celebrations so successful.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Picton Thirlmere Bargo RSL Sub Branch Anzac service and march, which took place as part of Wollondilly Remembers, was attended by the Thirlmere Volunteer Rural Fire Brigade; 237 Cadet Unit; Ingleburn RSL Pipes and Drums; the Campbelltown-Camden District Band; students from Thirlmere Public School, Wollondilly Anglican School and Picton High School, who marched alongside sub-branch members, veterans and their families; members of the public; and Tharawal Land Council elders and members, who marched with their banner in recognition of the Indigenous Australian Defence Force Service. I would like to thank President Tim Bennett-Smith, Anthony Stringer, Ossie Biele, Kerry Chisolm, Philip Brockett and all the friends and volunteers who helped make this event such a success.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Campbelltown RSL's Anzac Day dawn service and later march and main service saw record crowds packed into Mawson Park. They enjoyed the blue skies and sunshine, which only added to the magic of the occasion.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways this outpouring of support for the Centenary of Anzac commemorations should be no surprise, as Macarthur has a rich and proud Anzac history. We can only imagine what it was like for our beloved ANZACs 100 years ago on the battlefields. Their actions set a standard for future generations, and I am extremely proud of my father and all the Defence personnel who have served this country. We thank and remember those who have sacrificed their lives for this nation. May the Anzac spirit live on in all our hearts forever. Lest we forget.</span>

                  <a href="247130" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAUNDY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I rise today to talk on the 100th anniversary of the ANZAC forces' landing at Gallipoli, one of the most important commemorative events in our nation's history. Like many of us in this House, I have had the honour this year of being involved in a range of community events, commemorations and school projects throughout Reid to mark the Centenary of Anzac. It has given me and many others in my electorate an opportunity to reflect on the great sacrifices that the men and women of our armed services have made and continue to make for all of us so that we can live in our wonderful, free and tolerant society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 50,000 and 60,000 Australians served at Gallipoli. More than 19,000 were wounded and 8,709 were killed in action. There were also 11,000 New Zealanders at Gallipoli: 2,721 were killed in action and 4,752 were wounded. Of course, on the centenary of Anzac we reflect not just on the Gallipoli campaign but on the entire First World War and the century of service which has flowed from it. Australia's involvement in the First World War came at a great cost to our nation. Out of a population of just five million in 1914 more than 417,000 Australians volunteered to serve in the First World War. Some 332,000 served overseas. Australia suffered one of the highest casualty rates of the allied forces: more than 61,000 made the supreme sacrifice and some 152,000, just fewer than one in every two, were listed as casualties by the time of the armistice in November 1918. The sheer number of memorials to the fallen across our country demonstrates how widely these losses were felt and perhaps goes some way to explain why the Anzac legend has lived on through generations since. One of the great things I have taken away from all the Anzac ceremonies and events that I have been to this year is that I have no doubt that the memory of those servicemen and women will continue to live for the next 100 years and well beyond. The reverence and solemn understanding that I have seen in Reid schoolchildren has assured me of that—that future generations will continue to respect the sacrifice that those men and women made for our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of Anzac, Senator the Hon. Michael Ronaldson, for the excellent and heartfelt work that he and his office have undertaken in engaging with schools in our local communities in the lead up to the centenary. I am also confident that the Anzac story will live on in the families of our newest Australians, as I have seen migrant communities from a broad range of backgrounds paying their respects to our Anzacs. I will talk more specifically about the Australian Turkish community in Auburn in a moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst the many events that I was invited to attend this year, I would like to mention a few in particular. The Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway dawn service in Concord was held the weekend before Anzac Day. It was a very special occasion, including an original piece of classical music, <span style="font-style:italic;">Meeting the Sun</span>, composed by Elena Kats-Chernin and performed by the Australian Royal Navy Band and the Sydney Children's Choir, featuring lyrics taken from the poems of Australian diggers. This was followed by an address by His Excellency General the Hon. David Hurley AC DSC (Retired), Governor of New South Wales. Congratulations to John Haines, chairman of the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway, and Alice Kang from Concord Hospital. Our local RSL subbranches performed their duty proudly, as always, and held services across the electorate. I would like to thank the RSL subbranches of Auburn, Burwood, Concord, Drummoyne, Five Dock and Lidcombe for their efforts in putting on their services for local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the Reid Anzac Centenary Committee for assisting me in finding and selecting a range of projects for the Anzac Centenary Local Grants funding: Dr Abdurrahman Asaroglu, the president of the Gallipoli Mosque, Greg Blundell from Homebush Public School, Allan Chapple from Homebush RSL, Marlene Doran from Homebush RSL, Colin Hodges from Burwood RSL, Alice Kang from Concord Hospital or, as we know it, 'the Repat', Robert Ridge from Five Dock RSL, Bob Turner from Concord RSL and Harry Withers from Homebush RSL. The projects we funded focused on the restoration of memorials in the community, including $36,707 for the restoration of the Davey Square Memorial; $21,550 for the construction of the Davey Square Reserve Memorial Wall to display the wall plaques from the former Homebush-Strathfield RSL subbranch; $38,600 for the restoration of the Concord War Memorial precinct in Queen Elizabeth Park; and $3,913 for the restoration and relocation of the Concord Public School honour board and stone memorial to former students who fought in World War I.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The many schools across Reid have all participated in the centenary with their own services, class projects and memorials—unfortunately, too many to name in the limited time that I have here today. But I would like to pay a special thanks to the students who have put in so much work to research and learn about the servicemen and women from World War I and the campaigns and battles they took part in. Of course, the teachers who have guided them through that process also deserve praise for the important work that they do in helping our future generations develop and grow into tomorrow's leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to mention a number of events undertaken by the Turkish Australian community in my electorate. In Reid I am fortunate to represent the Western Sydney suburb of Auburn, which, in amongst the united nations of new and future Australians, is home to a strong Turkish Australian community. The 100th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli was a commemoration of special importance for Australians from a Turkish background. While our two countries are close friends today, in the First World War we both paid dearly with the blood of our young men. With our history inescapably linked through conflict, the famous words of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk echo through the years as a symbol of the healing that has occurred in the decades since:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives ... You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours ... You, the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With such an intertwined history between Turkey and Australia, it is perhaps no surprise to hear that this centenary commemoration was held in special reverence amongst Australians with Turkish heritage. The CEO of Australian Turkish Advocacy Alliance, Ertunc Ozen, and executive secretary, Gunes Gungordu, travelled to the centenary commemorations in Gallipoli to pay their respects to fallen Anzacs on behalf of the Turkish community in Australia. Auburn Gallipoli Mosque held a moving Lone Pine memorial service to commemorate both the ANZAC and Turkish fallen. The Wall of Friendship was unveiled in Auburn Memorial Park, with the inscription of the same words from Ataturk on that memorial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Auburn RSL sub-branch president, Mr Ron Inglis, provided a fitting summary when he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think it's excellent, I think it's a fine thing that while we certainly remember the sacrifices of soldiers on both sides and the terrible conditions that they faced, and we certainly honour them for their bravery and sacrifice, but at the same time it's really wonderful to come together in a community event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish with a personal story of two celebrations within the one day in my electorate in Reid. At Rosebank College in Five Dock I listened to students talk about their great-grandfathers and their service at Gallipoli. I hopped in the car at one o'clock, and at two o'clock I hopped out and we started a celebration at Amity College, an Islamic Turkish school in Auburn. An hour before I had been listening to Australian kids talk about their great-grandfathers who were Australian soldiers at Gallipoli. An hour later I had the honour and joy of hearing Turkish-Australian children talk about the service of their great-grandfathers on the Turkish side. Some 100 years ago their great-grandparents fought half a world away, 10 feet from each other in hand-to-hand combat on a daily basis. Today you travel an hour down Parramatta Road and you move from one service celebrating the Australian sacrifice to another celebrating the Turkish sacrifice. I think that is one of the joys of serving in my local electorate of Reid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge the legacy the Anzacs forged for the servicemen and servicewomen who have followed in their footsteps and we pay tribute to those who continue to uphold the Anzac tradition to this day. We will remember them. Lest we forget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="885" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TURNBULL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  I compliment the member for Reid on his contribution to this debate reminding us of the extraordinary significance of the Gallipoli campaign, a campaign which is part of the foundation story of three young nations: Australia, Turkey and New Zealand. Gallipoli is in a very historic part of the world filled with legends and stories of battles and heroism going back thousands of years. In many ways the myth, the life force, of three nations was founded there on those bloody cliffs and hills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would a nation, any nation, commemorate a terrible defeat? It was a defeat that was not the consequence of the enemy's overwhelming force or superior strategy, a defeat that was utterly mismanaged by our side—the British side—from the conception to the execution. The only flawless part of the Gallipoli campaign was the withdrawal, and there probably is not a lot of glory in that. What is the answer? Why Anzac Day?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A peaceful and peace-loving people laments war's folly and catastrophe, grieves for the dead, thanks them for their sacrifice but, above all, honours the inspiring courage, love, mateship and selfless heroism of the Anzacs. It is as though our nation, Australia, unlike any other, has cut through the gold braid, the medals, the great guns and ships and planes, has cut through all of that military grandeur, and reached down into the mud of the trenches and found what was really important: a human love, a yearning for peace, but preparedness to die in order to defend it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the humanity of the Anzac story that is timeless and appealing. It is the love of country, the love of comrades and the mateship—that sheer humanity that was the one thing that could not be ground down by the folly of the generals and the horror of the war itself. That is what inspires Australians, and that is why every year more and more people, especially young people, attend the dawn services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so it was that this Anzac Day dawn found us among a very young crowd of 10,000 at North Bondi in my electorate for the service at the cenotaph. The North Bondi RSL sub-branch has a heavy concentration of young veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan and those still serving. Their service was in line with their mission of supporting the diggers and veterans of 2015, not just honouring the diggers of 1915. Our modern army's sacrifice in Afghanistan was keenly recalled as the families of Sergeant Brett Till, Sapper Rowan Robinson and Corporal Scott Smith joined the service, three of the 41 Australian soldiers killed in that long war. We heard from the child of a veteran, the partner of a veteran and the parent of a veteran to put the emphasis, in the words of RSL trustee David Sims, on 'those who stay behind and those who serve Australia in a different, intimate, and important way'. I was pleased that we were able to support that North Bondi service and others throughout the electorate through our Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sub-branch general manager of operations, Kate Cass, who has served in Afghanistan, reflected on finally understanding the trials of her father's service through her own experience. This is part of what she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">On my most recent deployment to Afghanistan, thinking of him, I pictured two young people from two different eras in conflict overseas looking through the same eyes at the same devastation at our feet and asking the same question: Should we be here?.....but knowing that service to this great country is so very necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It a calling that stirs deep in the soul. It means military people have to, need to, and always will do put service first. I now know that if they don't, who actually will?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I now know now how capable the human mind and body are of adapting to adversity, and how capable the heart is of numbing itself against grief and fear. ANZAC Day for me is now no longer a retrospective concept.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in the morning the veterans of the Bondi Junction RSL marched to the Waverley Cenotaph, led by their president, Bill Harrigan. They were an older group, one or two from the Second World War, many from Vietnam and a few from wars of our own time as well. Reminding us that we did not fight Hitler alone, one of our Russian veterans attended, as he always does, in his magnificently medalled Red Navy uniform. He is always complimented by the old Australian diggers, who note that they could not fit into their old uniforms and they are very impressed that he is able to. The boys from Waverley College formed the catafalque party. As I sat there together with the community, I think all of us looked at the boys from Waverley College and looked at the names on the cenotaph and reflected that the names on the cenotaph were of young men who were not much older than the schoolboys at the service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But perhaps the most idiosyncratically Australian Anzac Day service this year, as every year, was that held down the hill at the Bronte Surf Club. The veterans, their friends and supporters from the local RSL marched along the promenade to the surf club, where a surf reel serves as a cenotaph, and the link of selfless service between the soldiers and the example of Anzac and the surf lifesavers—many of whom served and died in Australia's wars—is remembered and renewed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many of his generation, my grandfather Fred Bligh Turnbull did not talk about the war much. He had been wounded several times and gassed, which left him very short of breath all his life, but that did not stop him serving in the Second World War as well. They were a remarkable generation. Fred enlisted in 1915, a 22-year-old schoolteacher born on his parent's farm on the Macleay River near Euroka. He served in the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion for the last two years of the war, returning home in 1919. I remember Fred as an old man, me as a little boy. He had a sword from the time when he was promoted to an officer in the Second World War, and I always tried to get him to tell me stories about the war. You can imagine—little boys love that kind of thing. Fred did not want to talk about it. It was too horrible, too filled with needless death and mismanagement and poor leadership. Whenever we reflect on the First World War, we are reminded of the follies of war and we are reminded again and again that those Australian soldiers, whether they were at Gallipoli or elsewhere, were lions led by donkeys, until some lions in the form of Australian generals emerged—above all, of course, Sir John Monash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a very strong military history in my electorate. My electorate is a very old electorate. It is the inner city suburbs of Sydney. We have Victoria Barracks, one of the oldest military establishments in Australia. It was a major recruiting centre throughout the First World War and still is a military headquarters. We have two important naval establishments, at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Watson</span> and Garden Island. We have six RSLs. There are constant reminders in my community of our great military tradition. But it is not those landmarks that link the tradition of Anzac to our community; it is, as I said at the outset, the example of love and of mateship and of sacrifice. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can be proud of so many things as Australians but there is nothing of which we can be more proud than the Anzac tradition and the way in which we have taken a dreadful catastrophe, a shocking defeat, and made it a moment of celebration, of commemoration, of love, of sacrifice, of the most human values. This is really a peace-loving nation and one that respects the humanity that is not lost in the midst of war.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  I have great pleasure and a deep sense of pride to speak to this ministerial statement on the 100th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli and join with others who have spoken in this chamber about our involvement and what it means to us to commemorate that landing at Gallipoli and what it has given to our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 25 April 1915, young Australians from all walks of life rushed ashore at Gallipoli in the early dawn. They created, unknowingly at the time, a legend that would endure for more than 100 years. I believe from what we have seen throughout this 100th anniversary commemoration this year that it is in good hands in the hands of the next generation of Australians, who are taking up what is their possession forever, a priceless gift—the spirit of the Anzacs, the legend that in so many ways defines the values of our nation. I think so many Australians want to have attached to their own identity the enduring qualities that I believe describe what the Anzacs created that day—courage, determination and mateship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all, as they rushed ashore that morning in the early dawn, the Anzacs had the courage to do what they had to do, regardless of the dangers. They were young, enthusiastic and eager, like so many young people. We have all gone through it ourselves. We feel at that age a sense of indestructibility. They were determined, because they were representing Australia. They were serving under the Australian flag. They were proud. They had been trained. They had been recruited. There was in many ways the sense that it would be an adventure for them. They were determined that they would carry out their duty in the name of Australia as they went ashore at Gallipoli 100 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The enduring quality of mateship and identifying with your mates is something that lives with us all today. We will talk loosely sometimes about a mate we have. But, for them, as they went ashore, they knew they had a mate beside them who would not let them down, that they would not be abandoned if they got in trouble because their mate was there with them. That is another one of those enduring values that I believe describes in many ways what it is to be Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a wonderful site on the Gallipoli Peninsula. I had the great privilege as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the time to be able to establish that new site where we commemorate Anzac Day. I remember going there on a cold day in November, wondering whether we could move our commemoration out of a Commonwealth war cemetery to Ariburnu, right on the beach between Anzac Cove and North Beach. I thought to myself, 'How could you have lived in the open on these rugged hills above where I'm standing, day after day, night after night, with the real threat that you might lose your life but determined to survive there?' I knew I had a huge responsibility to make sure that, whatever we did, it was going to be a site where we would go in the future to commemorate Anzac Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was with the cooperation of the local farmers in the area and the local Canakkle council that the Turkish government assisted in the process of having land allocated right on the beach where in fact the Anzacs first landed at North Beach on the Gallipoli Peninsula. So it had historical significance. It was the site that we all know now is where we commemorate Anzac Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on the fact that, as we were commemorating the 100th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli this year, no matter where you looked, from the smallest country towns to the biggest cities, from the Australian War Memorial here in Canberra to places where Australians meet all around the world, on 25 April this year, Australians young and old were there because they were proud. But they were also there to remember those who lost their lives not only on that fateful day at Gallipoli but throughout the last 100 years—including, prior to Federation, in the Boer War. They remembered those who sacrificed their lives for the freedom and the way of life that we have but that sometimes I feel is taken for granted in this wonderful nation of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also proud of my own constituency. Even the smallest communities in the last 10 to 15 years have refurbished the war memorials that were erected in good faith sometimes 80 or 90 years ago. In some places, the community has diminished in population numbers. But the residents and councils still there have kept faith with the ideals of those who established a memorial in their town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those places, just west of my own home town where I grew up, is Muckadilla. I remember as a small child on Anzac Day seeing diminishing numbers year after year attending Anzac services there. Mainly they were those who had served. It got down to two or three people attending that service on Anzac Day. This year, there were over 300 who made a pilgrimage, honouring those from the area around Muckadilla who have served. In many ways, the centenary of the Gallipoli landings has ignited something in all Australians to want to know more about it. They stepped forward in their thousands and thousands all around Australia and many other parts of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a remote community out on the edge of the Simpson Desert at Bedourie, they had about 100 horsemen on horseback at a dawn service on a lonely hill to the north of the town—a place they call the Vaughan Johnson Lookout. In the early dawn it was very cold, but they were there. They made a very special effort, some bringing their horses over 300, 400 or 500 kilometres to participate in that dawn service on horseback, which reminds us all of the Light Horse and those who served in the Light Horse in the First World War and still serve in the Light Horse regiments today. I also want to acknowledge that in towns like Goondiwindi people gathered together the history of those from the area who had served and their families—their names, their records—and  compiled the most wonderful collection of the service records of over 500 men and women. They established a record that could have been lost in time were it not for people stepping forward. I commend the people who have done this in so many towns like Goondiwindi, as in Wallumbilla, to the east of my home town of Roma. So many communities did likewise. They collected the history of those from their community who served; they produced books, established little memorials and made collections of memorabilia, which, throughout time, may have been lost were not for the commitment of people wanting to participate in this year's Centenary of the landing at Gallipoli.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I have been invigorated and in many ways stimulated to see so many young people taking hold of a possession that they will have for their lives—the possession of the legacy of the Anzacs, the spirit of the Anzacs, that lives on 100 years since that landing at Gallipoli. I am sure they will pass it on to their children and their grandchildren. I know that our Anzac Day commemoration, the spirit of the Anzacs, is in great hands in the next generation of Australians, as it is likewise with the generations today. I thank the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  This morning I had the distinct pleasure of joining one of my primary schools, Pacific Pines State School, as their senior class, year 6, gathered at the War Memorial. There is something poignantly wonderful about seeing the next generation, on a cold Canberra morning, rugged up, come to the very soul of Australia to learn, to pause and to reflect. We conducted a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and paused for a minute's silence. When I left them, I left them in the good hands of a digger, a veteran of Vietnam, to talk about his service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this 100th year since we stormed the beaches of Gallipoli, I was able to stand there with the next generation and point them towards the bronze panels in the halls of the War Memorial, to talk to them about what it meant for two million Australians to have worn the uniform of our nation, to speak to them about freedom never being free—a price is paid by a few for many, ultimately by those over 102,000 names on those bronze panels—to talk through the loss of some 60,000 in World War I, including the loss of some 2,200 sets of brothers who fell in that conflict, and the 154 mothers who gave three sons in that conflict and, incredibly, the five mothers who gave four sons. It is always wonderful to spend time with the next generation, explaining what those that have gone before have done for those that live now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an extraordinary commemoration we have this year and then, rolling through to 2018, as we reflect on deeds done in the past, great men and women who have served and the nation they have left behind. The Prime Minister quite rightly represented the nation at Gallipoli; other senior colleagues were across parts of Europe. As the Prime Minister and I talked about where we should go, the Prime Minister, to his enduring credit and leadership, agreed that the minister needed to be with the current fight. So I spent the 100th anniversary of Anzac Day at the only service that was not televised, with the special forces troops in the middle of Iraq. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nestled between the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers at the special forces compound, I, with over 100 Australian special forces, including our colleagues from other nations and from the CTS of Iraq, which is the Iraq special forces, gathered on the dawn of 25 April this year. I also spent time at our operating base at Al Minhad, as well as two other locations—one in downtown Baghdad with our embassy, and with our aircraft force in the UAE to conduct similar services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something extraordinary about watching the dawn rise over Iraq with our fighting men and women. The commanding officer of the Special Operations Group there had found a bugler from US special forces, he had found a piper from US special forces and he had put a young lady photographer on top of one of the shipping containers to take appropriate photographs. There we celebrated, commemorated and remembered the 100th anniversary of Anzac Day—me, the commander of the joint task force in theatre, the Australian Ambassador to Iraq and the fighting men and women we have deployed. It was an extraordinary moment in an extraordinary dawn as those who still continue to fight remembered those who had fought so long ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I made the point, not just to the Australian special forces there but also to our air component out of UAE as well as to our embassy staff, that, as we stood there, it was hard not to be drawn into the fact that men and women not only fought on the ground but also fought in the air. On that day, 25 April 1915, the fledgling Australian Flying Corps had already embarked on ships bound for Iraq. Indeed, we were the only British dominion to establish a flying corps for service during the First World War, and by war's end the Australian Flying Corps consisted of four complete operational squadrons. Australia sent one squadron to the Middle East—No. 1 Squadron. By the way, when Australia sent Super Hornets back into Iraq last year, it was 1 Squadron that led the way, the same squadron that was formed and sent 100 years earlier. Of the 800 officers and 2,840 men who flew in the Australian Flying Corps, 175 were killed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Iraq in 1915, the Mesopotamian Half Flight was established at the request of the British government of India and operated out of southern Iraq. Australia only had enough personnel for a half-flight, so that is what was dispatched: four officers, 41 other ranks and 18 mechanics. The Half Flight's aircraft were provided by the Royal Flying Corps. Initially, they were obsolete designs that were also unarmed—Maurice Farman Shorthorn and Longhorn aircraft. With a top speed of 50 miles per hour where desert winds got up to 80 miles per hour, you literally flew backwards. The aircrew were for a time forced to use pistols and drop two-pound infantry hand-held bombs. They arrived too late to help secure the Shatt-el-Arab and the oil pipeline, but they joined the British advance on Baghdad. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There I was, in 2015, with Australian special forces on the outskirts of Baghdad, between the Tigris and the Euphrates, talking about the Australian airmen who had been there 100 years before, supporting the advance on Baghdad. In fact, on 4 July 2015, a Half Flight Cauldron G3 aircraft crewed by lieutenants George Pinnock Merz and William Burn were forced to land in enemy territory due to mechanical difficulties and were killed by armed civilians after a running gun battle over several miles. Our first casualties in the first air campaign in Australia's history were casualties on the ground in a land battle. The G3 had no machine guns that could be used to defend the aircraft. Ultimately, that attempt to reach Baghdad, supported by the Mesopotamian Half Flight, failed, with the tragic defeat at the Tigris marking the end of Australia's first experience of military aviation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an extraordinary time for me in the Middle East. It is fitting and to the great credit of the Prime Minister that he ensured that a minister was with the men and women who are in the fight now, as he joined other great alliance partners in Gallipoli and other ministers across the world as we all remembered those who had gone before us and who had led the way in acknowledging that axiom that freedom is not free; it is paid by a few for the benefit of the many. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was wonderful, at the same time, to see my own community on the Gold Coast come out in even greater numbers than before to reflect on what 100 years since the Gallipoli landings meant. The North Gold Coast RSL presented their new cenotaph—behind the Helensvale Bowls Club—which was ready in time for a fabulous service run by the RSL, which does so much for the community. Funds out of Anzac Centenary grants from the federal government were used by the majority of the schools in the electorate to run services to put in place rocks or cenotaphs of remembrance and to pay for wreaths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we commemorate the Centenary of Anzac, I thank the Australian service men and women, some 2,000, who are on 14 operational service missions across the world right now, eight of them in the Middle East. Thank you for all that you have done and all that you are doing. Thank you for your service to our country. This place recognises the sacrifices that you make and the sacrifices your families make. We recognise spouses at home and kids at home. We recognise the hard work and the seriously hard yards you do, with our flag on your shoulders and our country's name on your chests, for freedom's sake. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be an extraordinary few years as we continue this commemoration, but it is important that this parliament recognises, reflects on and remembers that over two million Australians have served, 2,000 continue to serve overseas and, in the years to come, thousands will serve under our flag, in our name. We remember you. We thank you. We are indebted to you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  This year, 2015, marks the 100th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli. This is a significant year of commemoration as we remember the fallen and all who have served and continue to serve our nation. It is a time to take stock of where we come from and what we want to be. This year, we are reminded of what we have gained as a nation in the debt of gratitude we all owe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gallipoli operation caused 26,111 Australian casualties, including 8,141 deaths. While this loss of life is difficult to comprehend today, we must put it into the context of a new and growing nation to truly appreciate its impact. Australia's total population at the time was less than five million, around the population of Sydney today, of which 417,000 enlisted, many falsifying their age so that they enlist and fight for their country. When the first ships carrying thousands of those brave young man approached the higher coastline of the Gallipoli peninsula 100 years ago, Australia had been a federation for just 15 years. Our soldiers stood on that foreign soil not as Queenslanders or as New South Welshmen but, for the first time, as Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first wave of men to arrive ashore was composed of the units of the 3rd Australian Brigade—three infantry battalions of men from Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. On 25 April, as dawn approached, they were tasked with storming the beach and pushing inland as fast as possible. But, even before they reached the beach, the bullets began. Still, they bravely pushed forward, taking on the steep peninsula in a hail of bullets. More than 620 Australians lost their lives on that first day. After nine days of continuous fighting, the battalion, which had landed with more than 1,000 men, had been reduced to just 309. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">New chapters to our national history were written and characteristics that have come to define us were born—endurance, determination, courage and mateship. We proudly embrace them to this day. As Australians, we have a responsibility to ensure that the sacrifice and service of those who fought in the First World War will be remembered by future generations. We are inspired to live up to the values that our service men and women displayed and which have served our nation well—values like mateship, courage, duty, sacrifice and dedication. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of McPherson we are fortunate to have an extremely strong, tight-knit ex-service community. Our local RSL sub-branches play an integral role in keeping the Anzac spirit alive, and I would like to take a moment now to thank each of them for their tireless work: Currumbin Palm Beach RSL Sub Branch and President Ron Workman OAM; Mudgeeraba Robina RSL Sub Branch and President James McCann; Burleigh Heads RSL Sub Branch and President Chris Keating OAM; and Tweed Heads and Coolangatta RSL and President Joe Russell. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to make special mention of the RSL services held in my electorate. The Currumbin RSL dawn service was one of a number of Anzac services that I attended on 25 April. This incredibly moving service was broadcast live on both television and radio. The service attracted over 25,000 attendees and quite possibly over 30,000. I was humbled by the incredible community engagement on such a significant day. I was also very proud of our southern Gold Coast community for hosting this national event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the honour of attending the march and mid-morning service at Burleigh Heads and the unique sunset service at Mudgeeraba. Both of these events were very fitting tributes to all our service men and women, past and present. Many people attended the services held at Tweed Services by the Tweed Heads Coolangatta RSL Sub Branch, and I thank that sub-branch for its commitment to the veteran and the wider community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across my electorate, record numbers attended Anzac services in this centenary year, to remember and commemorate the service and sacrifice of those who served and continue to serve. It was my privilege to join with the southern Gold Coast community in these commemorations and I congratulate and thank all involved for making these services so successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The McPherson electorate was also able to access $125,000 for projects commemorating the First World War. The Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program assists and encourages all communities to undertake projects to commemorate the service and sacrifice of our service men and women in the First World War. Once again, our southern Gold Coast community rose to the task, and I am pleased to be able to advise the House of the following projects currently underway or completed in McPherson: a flagpole and memorial plaque at Hillcrest Christian College; a memorial at the Australian Industry Trade College; commemorative gardens at King's Christian College; support to the Mudgeeraba Light Horse Museum to run the 'Telling the Anzac story' educational program; a memorial garden near the Great Hall at Somerset College; support to the Lions Club of Robina to assist in the construction of an Anzac memorial at the Robina Library and to deliver an educational program to schools; support to the Service Personnel Anglican Help Society for the construction of a First World War memorial garden; support to Currumbin Palm Beach RSL to preserve and display precious First World War memorabilia; money to the Mudgeeraba Robina RSL for the construction of a new memorial wall and First World War entry feature at the Mudgeeraba cenotaph; and a significant contribution to the Burleigh Heads RSL to install a new First World War memorial at the Burleigh Heads cenotaph. At four metres tall, 'The Anzac', as it is titled, depicts a soldier in the reverse-arms position and is composed of 100 individual layers of stainless steel—a striking tribute to our fallen soldiers. I encourage all visitors to the Gold Coast and all residents to go to Burleigh Heads and have a look at that memorial. It is absolutely outstanding and it looks quite different depending on where you are standing. I was delighted that, on the day of the dedication, Senator the Hon. Michael Ronaldson was able to be with us to be part of what was a very special event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge the McPherson Anzac Centenary Grants Committee, who worked to select these special projects for our community. The committee comprised Phil Roberts, Bren Milsom, Janelle Manders and Councillor Daphne McDonald, and I thank them for their efforts. Gallipoli was a defining moment in our national history. I am proud of our continued commitment to honour the memory of those men and women who laid down their lives for Australia. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  Nothing compares to standing on the beach at Gallipoli. When you see the gravestones just by the water's edge, it really communicates itself to you—the sacrifice that Australians made in the pursuit of our national identity and in those terrible battles where 8,000 Australians died, in that salient place that could not be penetrated in all of those months of 1915.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I toured Gallipoli with the great Turkish historian from Canakkale university, Kenan Celik, who the previous day had taken me to the nearby site of Troy. Professor Celik's lifelong support for all Australians who visit that part of the world is truly appreciated and is emblematic of the kind of friendship that has grown up between Turks and Australians. We ended the day at Cape Helles. Standing underneath the colossal statue that the Turks have erected at the point of Cape Helles, he gave me some long historical perspective of the events at Gallipoli. He said, 'Michael, close your eyes and think that 80 years ago there were boats full of Australians rowing their way slowly towards Anzac Cove; close your eyes and imagine, thousands of years ago, Greeks rowing their way from the other side of Cape Helles into the Bosphorus towards Troy.' That part of the world has been the scene of great historical drama, including for Australia. The Turks, rightly, venerate Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who was under explicit orders of the Germans, who commanded the Turks in the field, not to do anything unless he received direct German military orders. Kemal Ataturk knew better the great military dictum that Marshal Grouchy should have listened to at the Battle of Waterloo: march to the sound of the guns. As soon as he heard reports of the Australians landing, the Turkish division that he commanded ran to the heights of Chunuk Bair. There are many tales of Australians on the second ridge who actually saw the officer commanding—the later President of Turkey. Had he been shot or had we got to the third ridge, the entire history of the First World War might have been different. I know these stories because my lifelong friend the President of the Turkish RSL in Melbourne, Ramazan Altintas, and I often reprise what might have been and I have certainly discussed with him my visit to Gallipoli.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My personal odyssey with the First World War begins with my grandfather many years before that. As a little boy I remember him marching to the St Kilda Army and Navy Club outside Luna Park, up that scary European-style grill elevator up to where we used to have the Christmas party for kids at the St Kilda RSL. Representing the opposition, my odyssey took me to the First World War battlefield at Villers-Bretonneux, and I remember walking up the hill and seeing a sandstone wall in which the names of 10,000 Australians who were killed in the First World War and who had no known grave were engraved. There is a big sandstone monument in the middle which is pockmarked, and I was shocked to see that. I said to the Australian ambassador, 'Mate, you ought to be sharper in your job and have that fixed up.' He said, 'You don't understand, Michael—in the Second World War all of the Australian statues that surrounded this monument were blown up by the Germans, and they used this one for target practice by the Messerschmitt's from the local airfield. We did find on that wall the name of my grandmother's brother, David Swan, who was one of the thousands of Australians butchered in the British-led military operations after the Battle of Pozieres—probably the most disastrous event for the Australian nation in the First World War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we have had many activities in my electorate to remember these events. With due respect to Fremantle, the largest troopships—and in fact all the troopships—left from Port Melbourne. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Orvieto</span> left on 19 October 1914 to take troops to fight and train in Egypt and Lemnos and then land at Gallipoli. We are all very proud of the centenary grants, which we have dispensed with due care and solemnity to various worthy groups in all of our electorates to remember these events, and I think that has been a very good program. We have done projects with the Australian Turkish community and with the Australian Greek community, and for the nurses, which the member for Lalor and I attended on the weekend. I will return to that in a second. The departure from Port Melbourne is very iconic because you see in every RSL around the country pictures on the walls of the Australians leaving there, with all of the streamers being thrown at them and very big crowds on the dock down below. Port Melbourne in those days was pivotal to the war effort. Melbourne was then the capital of Australia, and war materials were shipped from Port Melbourne to the far side of the world. Around 126,000 servicemen embarked from Port Melbourne, and more than 19,000 of the 60,000 who died in the First World War were from Victoria. My grandfather John Peek, later commissioned lieutenant, left for training in Egypt and landed in the first reinforcement at Gallipoli. To the great pride of generations of our family, his commission—proudly framed at home on our wall—was received on the battlefield in France, just as General Sir John Monash received his. My daughter found a wonderful picture of him with the officers of the 11th Brigade in the photo archive at the War Memorial—again an institution which honours the sacrifices of Australians through conflict. It is improving all the time and I pay tribute to Brendan Nelson for all of the work that he does the there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gallipoli continues to impact on Australia—especially on how Australians see themselves. <span style="font-style:italic;">The W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ater Diviner</span> is Russell Crowe's directorial debut, and it shows us to the world. Crowe's film is particularly sensitive and particularly typical of modern Australia, and a greater understanding of our Turkish friends is emblematic in the film. If I may say so, I believe the great Turkish actor Yilmaz Erdogan stole the show. He was by far the best actor—better than Crowe—in this wonderful production, which I urge people to go and see. The evocation of life in Turkey and the post-war difficulties are very important for Australians to understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this weekend we have commissioned a brilliant sculpture by Peter Corlett of Matron Grace Wilson and a recuperating digger. Of course <span style="font-style:italic;">ANZAC </span><span style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">irls</span> made Matron Wilson famous, and we now remember properly the role of Australian nurses stationed on the Greek island of Lemnos. It was wonderful to have my colleague the member for Lalor there with her two sisters, all three of whom were granddaughters of one of the great heroic nurses and one of the first Australian women to serve in a battlefield situation, on Lemnos. This project was the largest grant for the Port Melbourne Centenary of Anzac fund and the launch was attended by the Greek consul general and hundreds of other people. I think the program has been a worthwhile way of remembering those events that have forged our great country. I am very supportive of the War Memorial and Brendan Nelson's continuing work. </span>

The Western Australian government, in thrall to the monomaniacal road-building fetish of the Abbott government, is ploughing ahead with its intention to build the state's most expensive road—the state's first toll road—a truck freeway, through fragile wetlands, Indigenous heritage and local residential communities, with no regard for proper planning, cost-benefit ratio analysis or long-term freight solutions.</span>

Yesterday morning he told a group of concerned residents that all the environmental approvals had been given.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Smashing a six-lane freeway through the middle of the Beeliar wetlands will cause environmental damage on a scale that was previously judged unacceptable by WA's Environmental Protection Authority in 2003, and I expect the EPBC assessment will confirm that judgement. I do hope someone in Minister Hunt's office makes a special effort to call Mr Nalder.</span>

George Brandis QC, visited my electorate to announce $35,000 for the Hinkler House Memorial Museum and Research Association to restore the Armstrong Siddeley of the great aviator, Bert Hinkler—the very man my electorate is named after.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the absolute pleasure of meeting some of the very passionate people who have made this project possible, including members of the Bundaberg Vintage Vehicle Club who are meticulously restoring the car. Tom Smethurst, who generously donated the vehicle, also gifted me an original Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire Mark I handbook. He had done his research and knew that I too own an Armstrong Siddeley.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis and I also hosted a community forum on national security at the Bundaberg RSL. A recent survey of the Hinkler electorate found national security and border control is the No. 1 issue of concern in my electorate. This may have something to do with the fact we have a larger than average veteran community and that the number of young Hinkler residents applying to join the Defence Force has increased significantly in recent years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis was very generous with his time. He had lunch with members of the Bundaberg Law Association and attended a cocktail function with the Bundaberg Art Society. I was very grateful to the Bundaberg Art Society for hosting the event, and I am delighted to have been recently announced as their patron.</span>

Wahgunyah is one of the jewels in the crown that is Indi—on the banks of the Murray, across the river from Corowa and up the road from Rutherglen. The school was first established in 1857. Wahgunyah is also home to the famous Uncle Tobys cereal factory, many famous wineries, a terrific local post office and, most importantly, Craig and Margaret's servo!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the highlights of the school is their commitment to drama and filming. The students tell me that their absolute favourites—for the members of parliament, this can be found on their website—are the top-hitting <span style="font-style:italic;">Naughty Kids At School </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saga of Ned Kelly</span>.

The Pilbara Regiment is one of three Regional Force Surveillance Units employed in surveillance and reconnaissance of the remote areas of northern Australia and is responsible for an area of 1.3 million square kilometres.</span>

In fact, the longest-serving member of the regiment is female—Corporal Gill, who I mentioned earlier and had the pleasure of meeting. A number of the women in the regiment are qualified in the front line as 'patrolmen'. Maybe, there will be a time when we call them all 'patrollers'!</span>

The Pilbara Regiment is unique, and troops have to be multiskilled, and self-sufficient, and need the ability to adapt to the unique environmental conditions. The motto of the Pilbara Regiment is 'Mintu wanta', which is from a Western Desert Aboriginal dialect and means 'Always alert'. On behalf of the constituents of Durack and myself, I thank the Pilbara Regiment for the fantastic job they do in keeping our country and, more importantly, the northern part of Australia safe.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  From August 2013 to April this year, the time spent in detention centres has risen dramatically from an average of 72 days to 394 days. As of May 2015, there were 138 children held in immigration facilities on the Australian mainland and 81 children held in detention on Nauru. The rise in the amount of time spent in detention centres both in Australia and offshore is harming these children's physical and mental health. Late last year, detention centre medical staff confirmed that 34 per cent of the children aged between five and 12 years had mental health disorders comparable to children referred to hospital based child mental services for psychiatric treatment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Convention on the Rights of the Child highlights Australia's obligation to protect the mental health of children. It states that 'parties recognise the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health within Australia', yet we are keeping these children isolated within these camps. They are growing up filled with anxiety and apprehension, not knowing if or when they are finally going to be offered refuge. As one 13-year-old boy said: 'I left my country. I came here to have a better future, not to sit in a prison.' We must ask ourselves: how long is long enough for a child to wait for their freedom? </span>

So wrote Evangeline Stogiannou, from Glen Waverley Secondary College, who was a year 10 work experience student in my office. She was passionate about this. She asked to write about it. I want to thank Eva for her startling words.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Refugees are the backbone of our country. Australia has a proud record over many decades of welcoming refugees who have fled disaster and conflict to seek safety and a new life in our country. Government provides substantial financial and social support for refugees once they arrive in Australia. However, we Australians are a generous people, and I am regularly contacted by constituents wanting to know what they can do personally to assist refugees in our community. In response, I was pleased to organise and facilitate a presentation by the Multicultural Development Association on how individuals can offer practical and social support and create a warm welcome for refugees. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted that more than 100 local people turned up for the presentation to understand what they can do to contribute. There are things such as the family match program, the job club and little things like helping new refugees go to official appointments, explaining the local facilities to them, providing extra English classes, helping prepare them for business and work or perhaps volunteering to pay public transport costs for them. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also provide information on the many support services in the community like the Romero Centre, who also ask for food hampers. I was appalled to hear from a support worker who went to help one group that they did not know that they could freely access the green space opposite the local park. These are things where we can all help. I thank the Multicultural Development Association.</span>

Among the many fantastic programs that operate in my community, I am particularly excited about the program Logan Together. The philosophy is: 'Every child, every opportunity'. It aims to pull together all the resources in our community—our tremendous support groups, our experienced leaders and our committed and devoted community workers—to improve the chances of Logan kids.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is true that thousands of kids grow up and thrive in my area, there are some children who start life with greater barriers to success than they should. As a consequence, we have a lot of work to do to improve our rates of in-home reading, attendance at preschool and NAPLAN results of kids so that they get up near the state and national averages. Getting this right is, of course, in the children's best interests but also in the long-term interests of our community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The director, Matthew Cox, has been a great choice of leader for this project, and he will be well supported by his team and by all three levels of government. I want to take this opportunity to wish Matthew's team at Logan Together all the best. I think I can say on behalf of everyone in our community that we want their project to be successful, and when it does succeed it will be a model for effective social policy across the nation and it will show again that our community in Logan City is a place that looks out for each other and looks after each other.</span>

It was a very special time, because there in Ceduna we saw the leaders of every Indigenous organisation and the leaders of the local council take a stand together, to clasp hands across the table, and say collectively, 'We are going to take on the threats to our society.' With the cashless debit card, 80 per cent of people's income will go into this card. They will be able to spend it on anything they like, except alcohol and gambling services. They will not be able to get cash, so of course they will not be able to buy drugs. </span>

I call on this government to ensure that this service that saves lives, that saves Aboriginal lives, continues. It is more than a phone line; it is a lifeline. What price a life in this country?

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  One of the great challenges for our community and for our society is how we tackle the rising instances of youth mental health issues. One in four young Australians aged between 16 and 24 have a mental health issue, and three-quarters of all mental health illness manifests before the age of 25. This is something that I have campaigned very hard on locally. I am very proud to say that the coalition government will be building a new headspace facility in Caboolture. This will fundamentally change the lives of many locals, ensuring that they get the best possible care in the country and providing a preventive approach to youth mental health issues. Tragically, while it is very hard to measure these figures, local service providers tell me that our community has almost twice the national average youth suicide rate. </span>

The tender has been awarded in the last few weeks to an organisation called United Synergies. I have visited some of their headspace facilities, and they provide an incredibly high level of care for the local regions that they service. One of the other things that this headspace facility will do is bring together all of those service providers, to ensure that we are all working together locally to give those young locals the best possible opportunity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Maroubra Beach is renowned for its powerful surf and for producing some of the world's best surfers and surf-lifesavers. This has been recognised in the fact that Maroubra Beach is the second national surfing reserve and the home of the Australian Surfing Walk of Fame. As a tribute to Australia's best surfers, plaques are embedded in the promenade, outlining the careers of the likes of Nat Young, Midget Farrelly, Snow McAlister, Grant Kenny, Karla Gilbert and Mark Scott. In July each year, our community comes together to celebrate our beach culture with the Beach Breaks festival and the unveiling of the latest inductees into the Australian Surfing Walk of Fame. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, four world-class surfers, who I am pleased to say are all Maroubra locals, were inducted: former world junior surfing champion Jessi Miley-Dyer, local surfing legend Steve 'Blackie' Wilson, and former Olympians and Australian champion surf lifesavers Wally Brown and Ron McKeon. On behalf of our community, I wish to congratulate these four great sportspeople and ambassadors for surfing and surf-lifesaving in Australia. You are very worthy of immortalisation in the Australian Surfing Walk of Fame. I also thank and congratulate Randwick City Council for organising and putting on this wonderful festival each year and for the wonderful sense of community that Randwick City Council has.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  As we reflect upon Gallipoli, let me just say that this Saturday, 15 August, is Victory in the Pacific Day. I use this opportunity to speak about this issue, because it involved many Australians being treated appallingly—some 22,000 were captured in the Pacific campaign. Most of the Australians were moved to a prison in Singapore, Changi. Many were transferred to the Thai-Burma Railway. There were many members of parliament who served in Canberra after the Second World War who came with that experience etched in their memory. One still alive—and a great Australian—is Sir John Carrick, somebody whom I admire enormously. Others were Tom Uren, whom we remembered as he passed away so recently, and Sir Kenneth Anderson, a government leader in the Senate, whose family I knew, and formerly the mayor of Ryde. They also included Sir Reginald Swartz, whom I had the pleasure of meeting. Can I say that amongst those that I did not were Charles Anderson MP; Adair Blain; George Branson; Sir Alexander Downer, Alex's father; Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes; Thomas Pearsall; and Sir Winton Turnbull, I believe no relation to Malcolm Turnbull. We ought to be very proud of what they were able to do and remember them on the 15th of this month.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I am a proud member of a trade union, and I have been for a long time. Our country has a strong history of trade unions—people coming together in their workplaces to have a say and to have a working relationship with their employers. Over 100 years ago, those workers came together and said that they also wanted to have a political voice, and that was how the Labor Party was formed in this country. Today, the Labor Party continues to have a strong relationship with the trade union movement. In many ways, the Labor Party continues to be the political voice for the Labor movement, and I am really proud of that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on the election of this government, we knew very quickly that this government would do whatever it could to take down its political opponents—to divide and try and conquer the labour movement. Over the last couple of months—in fact, since the election of this government—good union people, workers, have had their views and values challenged and thrown into question as we have seen union and Labor leaders dragged into royal commissions by this government. This government has tried to pull down its political opponents. This government has tried to politicise a forum which should be used for the most serious of grievances. Today, we have discovered how closely the person at the centre of that royal commission is linked to the Liberal Party. He is the keynote speaker at a Liberal Party fundraiser. This government and the way in which it is corrupting the union movement— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

For too long, we have had to endure substandard roads and not the right infrastructure for us to commute to the city and for us to have employment close to home. I am very proud to be part of a government that is investing $3.6 billion in the upgrade of key vital roads and arteries that will make our city move. This $3.6 billion worth of road infrastructure is already seeing investment like the Sydney Science Park, a 280-hectare site where 12,200 jobs in biotech innovation—STEM jobs—will be coming to the people of Western Sydney. This is very important; 80 per cent of this $3.6 billion is coming directly from the federal government. </span>

How many people struggle with Glenmore Parkway every morning trying to get to work or get their kids to school? It will also mean an upgrade to Bradley Street. Bradley Street, along the Northern Road, is also a huge issue for so many constituents. I am excited that we are finally going to see movement on these things. We are going to see these roads upgraded and we are going to see better accessibility for all the people right across Lindsay. </span>

Stockton is a community that was due to have access to the National Broadband Network in 2016, but then was wiped off the rollout map when this government was elected. I recently conducted a survey in Stockton, with 124 residents responding with shocking stories about their lack of access to the internet and the impact this is having on their lives. Fifty-one per cent of respondents cannot get access to any ADSL broadband at their home.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Superfast broadband is essential to harness the economic potential of Newcastle's budding entrepreneurs and businesses. That is why under Labor the entire electorate of Newcastle, including Stockton, was on the map for connection by 2016. While most of the electorate, including Stockton, has now been added back onto that rollout map, just a fraction will be connected to the NBN next year, creating a digital divide across the city. The Minister for Communications should start treating all Novocastrians with respect— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I would like to raise the issue of aged care in Cowan, particularly the proposal for a care facility combined with independent living units at Paradise Quays in Ballajura within Cowan. This has been on the agenda for many years and there have been many complications based upon landownership and even the existence of the Water Corporation's chlorine facility in the nearby area. I myself have been involved since 2009. We are soon coming to the time for federal involvement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am nevertheless glad that the negotiations between the City of Swan and the state government have been successfully concluded regarding the ownership of the land so that facilities can be built. Now the negotiations continue regarding movement of the chlorine facility Koondoola so that the exclusion zone can also be moved and allow a more viable building program on the site. Several years ago, Councillor Mel Congerton of the City of Swan and I met with the state minister to discuss the relocation of the chlorine facility. That cost has escalated since then and challenges for a viable project remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that these negotiations will also be successful, but I want to say that I appreciate Senator the Hon. Mitch Fifield meeting with me in his capacity as the Assistant Minister for Social Services so that I can keep him informed of this important project. Once the infrastructure issues can be resolved and a provider identified, then it becomes increasingly a federal issue with the application for care places being made. I am determined to get this project built and deliver federal support for my constituents in Ballajura.</span>

Yet despite recurring ESCAS breaches in Kuwait, Israel, Gaza, Jordan and Vietnam, not one export company has been prosecuted or faced licence suspension. Australians have every right to question why.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, Animals Australia's Lyn White has written to MPs to bring to our attention that a significant percentage of Australian sheep shipped to the major markets of Kuwait and Jordan are being killed and exported onwards to other countries as boxed Australian meat. This is ridiculous: contrary to both the interests of our animals, as well as our commercial interests. Australian animals are unnecessarily enduring a gruelling and distressing 25-day journey only to become a profitable meat export trade for another country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a matter of urgency, I join with Animals Australia in calling on the Department of Agriculture to mete out penalties on repeat offending export companies, such as licence suspension and prosecution, which will serve to motivate compliance with ESCAS. Decades of horrific abuse of Australian sheep at the Al Rai market in Kuwait and elsewhere will only end when offending live export companies are forced to take their regulatory— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Andrew has faced many challenges in his life. He was born with two holes in his heart. During the surgery to repair those holes, Andrew suffered a stroke that caused him to become intellectually disabled. When Andrew was five, he was diagnosed with velocardiofacial syndrome. When he was eight, Andrew started riding with the local Riding for the Disabled Australia in Blackwood. Over the last 19 years, he has become an accomplished rider. Last year, he was selected to the Special Olympics Australian team and became the first male competitor to represent Australia in equestrian.</span>

Our team competed alongside 7,000 athletes from 177 countries. Andrew represented his country very well. In his first attempt at the games, he won both a gold and a bronze medal in his events. This is an incredible achievement which has required years of dedication, hard work and support from family and friends. Congratulations, Andrew. I believe I can speak for our local community when I say that we are very proud of you.</span>

I know that they are also meeting with government ministers. They are talking about the need for governments at both state and federal levels to engage in a policy to save the steel industry.

I can assure her that, every day, this government's focus is clear: it is on jobs, growth and community safety. Every day, we are implementing our plan for a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. I can assure the member for Forrest that this government has already cut the overall tax burden that Australians face by some $6 billion. We have abolished the carbon tax, saving the average household $550 a year. We have abolished the mining tax, which means that Australia is once more a good place to invest. We have supported small business with the best budget ever for small business, with a tax cut just for small business, with the instant asset write-off just for small business. We have delivered free trade agreements with our three biggest trading partners. We are rolling out the biggest infrastructure program in the history of the Commonwealth. And we are cutting red tape by some $2 billion every year. I can inform the member for Forrest that our plan is working, the economy is strengthening. In the March quarter, the Australian economy's growth was almost the fastest in the developed world.</span>

                  </a>  In the March quarter, housing construction was up by 4.7 per cent and that is the best result in six years. In the March quarter, exports were up by five per cent and that is the best result in 15 years. Service exports were up by eight per cent and that is the best result in eight years. Over the last 12 months, retail sales are up by 4.9 per cent. In July, car sales set a new record. So our economy is strengthening where it matters most when it comes to jobs. There are now more than 335,000 extra jobs in our economy than where things were in September 2013. That is 335,000 more people in work now than at election time. The participation rate is up because people are more confident. Female participation is at the highest level on record. ANZ job ads are 9.3 per cent higher now than a year ago and have risen in 10 of the last of 12 months. And the cost of living is down for so many families not just because of the abolition of the carbon tax but because interest rate cuts mean a family with an average mortgage is $1,500 a year better off. This government has a plan. The plan is working. We are delivering for the good people of our country.</span>

He has a very large Chinese community in his electorate, particularly in Hurstville. This morning and yesterday afternoon the Minister for Trade and I hosted the second annual Australia-China Strategic Economic Dialogue with Chairman Xu Shaoshi, who is one of the most significant ministers in China and one of the most senior economic ministers. It was very timely that he should be here as Chair of China's National Development and Reform Commission, which has responsibility for the overall management of the Chinese economy. Clearly, there is a great deal of discussion around the world about what is happening in the Chinese economy. As Chairman Xu said to us, there are many different pressures on the global economy—and not just what we have seen recently in Greece. There is a great deal of emerging anxiety about increases in interest rates in the United States. There are also capital outflows from emerging economies, and low oil prices and commodity prices are having quite a significant impact on developing economies like Indonesia, where Chairman Xu is about to fly to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bottom line is that China sees the movements in its currency and decisions made by the governor of the PBOC, the Chinese central bank, as about facilitating greater capital flows. Importantly, we need to remember that the yuan has appreciated significantly in recent times and that has had quite some significant impact on Chinese exports. The Chinese economy, much like the Australian economy, is going through a transition. In more recent times, it was a very significant exporter. Whilst trade flows have increased for China, they have an excess amount of residential real estate, an excess amount of steel and, importantly, they are trying to get their consumer class to lift. The more we can get that consumer class in China to lift, the greater the opportunity for Australian exporters. Chairman Xu reinforced to us and we affirmed to him that the China free trade agreement is good for Australia and good for Australian jobs, and we are determined to see it through because it is going to deliver the prosperity for all parts of Australia that we want and jobs for all parts of Australia that we need. The more we can facilitate the growth of China and the opportunities in China, the wealthier Australia will be, because, as he reminded us emphatically, for every dollar we spend buying Chinese goods and services, the Chinese spend $2 every year. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I was referring to the fact that the headline in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> this week was about a $600 billion carbon bill. That is exactly the case, because this brings right to the point their terror at their own policy, their dishonesty about the impact of that policy and the fact that they said they would terminate the carbon tax at the last election and voted to keep it and the fact that they are now going to bring it back and impose on Australians a $600 billion carbon tax bill, a $209 carbon tax price, a $5,000-per-family hit and a 78 per cent impact on wholesale electricity prices. That is why this question from the member for Page is so important, because, unlike every member of that side who voted to keep the carbon tax, he voted to repeal the carbon tax. Every member on this side voted to repeal the carbon tax. As the ACCC showed us recently, that produced $550 of savings for Australian families on average. That is what the ACCC itself has said.</span>

Prime Minister, as you would be aware, regional broadcasters are running a campaign asking their MPs to change the rules. It seems we have reached an impasse on media reform. I really do appreciate that consensus is your aim, but this is eluding us. Can you tell me what the way forward is for the 120,000 of my constituents who rely on regional TV services for their local news and information?</span>

I accept that in the area of media regulation it is pretty clear that the technology is running ahead of the regulation. There is no doubt that that is the case. The trouble with the regulation of the media is that to change one thing is to impact on everything. That is why it is important to be careful before we make changes here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are reluctant to make a change in this area until we are confident that the changes that we have in mind are right. The best way to be confident that the changes that we have in mind are right is if we have secured a measure of consensus in the sector. That is what the Minister for Communications is working to achieve. Without a measure of consensus in the sector, the risk is that, were we to make a change, we would simply be taking sides in a commercial dispute—and that is the last thing any sensible government would want to do.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms JULIE BISHOP</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:27</span>):  I thank the member for Reid for his question and note that he is deeply concerned about this matter, particularly the reports today that the so-called Islamic State Hacking Division has infiltrated systems containing personal information of around 1,500 people, including eight Australians. This is deeply concerning and the subject of investigation by our security and intelligence agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken previously about how terrorist organisation such as Daesh exploit technology for their slick propaganda and recruitment purposes. Daesh is using platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter to spread its perverted ideology and to groom young people, in particular, to join its barbaric force. A recent study by the Brookings Institute found that Daesh and its supporters have at least 46,000 active Twitter accounts, each with an average of 1,000 followers. Just last month, an Indonesian Daesh fighter posted a series of tweets urging followers in Indonesia to kill Westerners, claiming this was an easy form of jihad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen thousands of examples from Australia and around the world of how young people have been lured through social media to support Daesh or join its fighting in Iraq and Syria, often ending up as suicide bombers. More than 20,000 foreign fighters from over 90 countries have been drawn to this conflict. As I have informed the House before, over 120 Australians are believed to be fighting with Daesh and around 30 are believed to have been killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last year, we have seen another emerging threat, with Daesh using increasingly sophisticated cyber capabilities for offensive purposes by conducting attacks aimed at disrupting services and revealing sensitive information. In March, the group claiming to be the Islamic State Hacking Division, in a separate incident, published online a list of photos, names and addresses of United States military personnel that it claimed was stolen from military computers with the aim of making these people targets for terrorist attacks. A recent report on Daesh's cyber capability released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, ASPI, warns that Daesh is pushing to boost its knowledge of offensive cyber operations, and the government takes this threat extremely seriously. The government's new national Cyber Security Strategy will improve our defences against cyber threats. We have allocated around $22 million to fight online extremism by shutting down extremist sites and challenging terrorist propaganda. We are strengthening cooperation in counterterrorism with our partners in the region, including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. We are determined to fight terrorism and to keep our people safe.</span>

The release of information that we have seen reported today from the so-called Islamic State Hacking Division is of great concern to the government, and our world-class law enforcement and intelligence agencies are working with their international partners to investigate. I am advised that there is no evidence to suggest that this disclosure is as a result of any compromise of systems that are based here in Australia, and our security agencies are not aware of any specific threats to the eight individuals whose information has been compromised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The safety and security of Australians is this government's first priority and we take these claims very seriously. The government recognises the full range of cyberthreats that we face and we are taking action to address them. We are partnering with industry in the coming months to develop a range of robust measures that tackle cyberthreats and increase security across Australia's networks, be they public or private. These initiatives will be announced in the coming months when the government releases the new Cyber Security Strategy, as has been foreshadowed by the foreign minister, which will improve our defences against cyberthreats. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The claims of hacking are a reminder that the threat from ISIL is real. Australians are being groomed by extremists here in Australia and also online in an effort to radicalise and recruit our young people in particular. Around 120 Australians have already been groomed to go and fight alongside these terror organisations in Syria and Iraq. So this government's efforts to disrupt, degrade and very importantly to ultimately destroy ISIL are more important than ever.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Countering Violent Extremism Program is a key part of this and it is already underway. We have invested $40 million, which is three times the investment made by the previous government, in major initiatives that turn people away from violent extremism and stop them moving down the very dark path of radicalisation. This includes $22 million, which we have allocated specifically in this year's budget, to counter online extremism and to challenge terrorist propaganda by providing better messages out there for those who might be seeking information online. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are already working very effectively with social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and Google, and working very effectively with government agencies, such as the Australian Communications and Media Authority, to tear down online extremist propaganda. We will continue to do all that we can to work with the private sector and with communities, particularly vulnerable communities, to take all possible steps that stop our fellow citizens being radicalised and stop anyone in Australia being of harm to others in the community.</span>

                  </a>  commissioner's decision that it would be inappropriate to appear at a Liberal Party fundraiser. Now, Mr Speaker, let me make these fundamental points. This government defends the integrity of the royal commissioner; and, if members opposite are not prepared to accept the integrity of the royal commissioner, they should say exactly what their charge against him is. If members opposite want to question the integrity of the royal commissioner, they should point out exactly what they believe the lack of integrity on the part of the royal commissioner has been.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point that I make—and I have made it now, I think, four times today—is that this government is certainly prepared to debate the subject matter of the royal commission. We are certainly prepared to debate the subject matter of the royal commission, because what the royal commission has exposed time and time and time again is union officials who have ripped off workers to help the unions, union officials who have ripped off workers to help themselves and union officials who have ripped off workers to advance their political careers—and some of them are sitting over there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to members opposite that, if they were serious about redeeming themselves, if they were serious about helping to protect honest unionism in this country, the one thing they would do is support the Registered Organisations Commission bill, which would mean that the same standards of integrity were required of union officials as have long been required of company directors.</span>

What is the point of trying to pursue this issue through question time? It is one thing when the Prime Minister cannot agree with his Attorney-General; but he cannot even agree with himself between his first answer and his most recent answer. We have somebody before us who is willing to mislead this parliament, who thinks that he can get away with saying one thing and then saying the exact opposite only 30 minutes later and maybe no-one will notice.

Second, if we are to take into account the argument that he has put in his own defence and that others have put in his defence, that maybe he was unaware it was a fundraiser, then he is incompetent. In his job, he is meant to be the person who knows what questions to ask. Checking who is organising an event is not a bad question to ask. So, the royal commissioner is conflicted and biased, or, at best—the best we can end up with out of this—he is incompetent.</span>

We had the situation previously—and it was a sign that we should have taken notice of—where Ian Harper, at the same time we had the Harper review, was wanting to attend fundraisers for the member for North Sydney. Maybe we should have realised then that the Liberal Party know absolutely no shame when it comes to misappropriating the requests and doing things the wrong way by having statutory officers engage in fundraising events for their party, because the one group that definitely knew the whole way through how inappropriate this was was the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party knew it was a fundraiser when they issued the invitation. The Liberal Party knew exactly what they were doing when they put this request out. When the front cover of the document has the Liberal Party logo, it is probably a hint that it is a Liberal Party function. But, if the Prime Minister does not get the hint at the Liberal Party logo—and we are working on the basis that he may have seen it before—the reason that we have to suspend standing orders and cannot pursue this simply through questions—</span>

But, maybe if he did not twig at that, how about this one, Prime Minister: 'A receipt will be issued. All proceeds from this event will be applied to state election campaigning.'

But read the words of that statement when he withdrew from the event. He could not attend any event that was described as a Liberal Party event. He would be unable to give this address, at least while he is in the position of royal commissioner. So he is already flagging, 'Hey, guys; don't forget about me. The moment this one's over, I'll be back there for your fundraiser.' He could not even hold back from making sure that he gets invited to the Liberal Party fundraisers again in the future. </span>

No. And then, when we start to refer to issues in the debate during the suspension, they say, 'You can't do that—oh no. Quick, jump up with a point of order.'

Those opposite have known since April, and they never thought it was a problem. They have known since April, and they thought it was fine to continue. Those opposite thought: 'If this is what's going on, that's further proof that this commissioner is doing the exact sort of job that he was appointed to.' That is what they are doing. We have the recommendations that we had from the Prime Minister. He said, 'You appoint someone of this man's standing because you trust to his judgement.'

It is not being suggested that Dyson Heydon is actually biased. Of that we do not know and of that we make no further comment. <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting" style="font-style:italic;">It is the appearance of bias that is of concern; it is the appearance given to every fair-minded Australian, every fair-minded observer who is looking at this conduct, of a royal commissioner appointed by this Prime Minister agreeing to speak at a Liberal Party fundraiser. That is the problem.</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting" style="font-style:italic;">That is the problem which cannot now be cured and no amount of obfuscation by this government, no amount of obfuscation by this Liberal Party, can obscure what has occurred.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting" style="font-style:italic;">This royal commissioner should resign—he should resign because by his own actions he has created the appearance of bias and he has discredited and compromised every single further action by this royal commission. If he does not resign, he should be sacked by this government. The Prime Minister who appointed him, with his captain's pick, should dismiss this royal commissioner. If he does not resign and if he is not sacked by the Prime Minister and this royal commission proceeds, its findings will be of no value to the people of Australia because they are already discredited because of this extraordinary error of judgement made by this royal commissioner. This Liberal Party royal commission into trade unions has spent over $80 million of taxpayers' money so far pursuing the political opponents of the Abbott government. Of course corruption is to be deplored, of course allegations of serious misconduct are to be thoroughly investigated and of course anyone involved in illegal behaviour in any workplace, whether unionist or employer, should feel the full weight of the law—and Labor has made clear again and again that we have no tolerance for corruption of any kind. But this royal commission, Mr Abbott's royal commission, should be seen for what it is. I do not know why members opposite are laughing but clearly they do not think this is a serious a matter about which standing orders should be suspended. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting" style="font-style:italic;"> of the Australian people. The Prime Minister created this royal commission to smear the reputation of all unions in this country, and wherever possible the Prime Minister wanted this royal commission to smear the government's political opponents in the Labor Party if </span>
                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting" style="font-style:italic;">it</span>
                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting" style="font-style:italic;"> could. This royal commission was set up by the Abbott</span>
                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting" style="font-style:italic;"> government and has been conducted by a royal commissioner hand-picked by the Prime Minister to achieve political outcomes—not outcomes for the benefit of Australia but the political outcomes that this Abbott government wants to pursue. The highly politicised nature of this royal commission has been plain for all to see from the first day of hearings. Those of you who were watching it all would recall that the first day of hearings was concerned with former Prime Minister Julia Gillard about events that were said to have occurred more than 20 years ago—and it turned up nothing. But that was the purpose of this royal commission; that was the first smear that this royal commission wanted to land. That is why standing orders should be suspended. This royal commission has also dragged the leader of the federal opposition before it to answer questions. Once again a Labor leader had to answer hundreds and hundreds of questions about matters in the past, and it led nowhere. The misuse of executive power which is represented by this royal commission is unprecedented in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I rise on this incredibly important matter of public importance—that is, the Prime Minister's continued love affair with $100,000 degrees. It is so unfortunate that, despite this legislation being rejected by the this parliament on two occasions, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education seem obsessed with bringing it back a third time. I have a message for the Prime Minister and for the Minister for Education: this is a dud of a policy. It is a policy that will not have support from this parliament, and it is time they gave up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has said this week:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a lot of people who voted for us were going to feel dudded.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They certainly felt dudded by the 2014 budget, in which the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education brought the Australian people a proposal that they had no notice of. In fact, before the last election, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education said that there would be no cuts to education. Indeed, they said that there would be no changes to university funding. The Minister for Education said this after the election in November. He said, 'No, we're not going to change the fees that we charge at universities.' It is understandable that the Australian people were shocked on budget night. Now, this bad piece of legislation—which would affect thousands of students, which would be a barrier to students choosing to take up a higher education degree and which would lead to so much debt for students—continues to be pursued by this Prime Minister. One must question whether or not it is a captain's pick. </span>

                  </a>  The fixer, sorry. If I were in a bind, I would not call the Minister for Education, but obviously the Prime Minister has. The Prime Minister has called up the fixer and said, 'Come and fix my problem.' He has tried. He spent $15 million on advertising his changes, which have been rejected by the parliament. We know that he was demon dialling the crossbench, who were rejecting his calls. They had had enough. They did not want him to call anymore. In fact, they deleted his number from their phone. What did he do? He said: 'They might not answer my phone call, but I am going to spend $150,000 on consultants. Maybe they will answer the phone to the consultants, if they won't answer my phone call.' Of course, the fixer cannot fix this for the Prime Minister—just like he cannot fix many things for the Prime Minister. This policy has been foisted on the Australian people. It makes severe cuts to our universities—billions and billions of dollars ripped out. It deregulates universities, forcing $100,000 degrees. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Education and the Prime Minister often claim that they have support from the university sector. We know that they are losing friends fast. They are losing friends fast when it comes to higher education and the minister's third round of proposed changes. Even the Group of Eight have said, 'It is time to go back to the drawing board.' The fixer has not been able to fix the Group of Eight; the fixer has now been told by the Group of Eight, his biggest supporters, to go back to the drawing board. So it is time for the government and the Prime Minister to abandon this plan, because the Australian people do feel incredibly dudded. As I said, this proposal is the third time that this has been brought to the parliament. Where is legislation? Of course, the Minister for Education—</span>

                  </a>  I hear the member on the other side of the table say, 'Double D.' I have to say, if the Prime Minister would like to go to a double dissolution election on his proposal for $100,000 degrees, bring it on. That is because when I am out talking—and perhaps the Prime Minister should get out a little bit more and talk to the Australian people—the Australian people certainly do not support his $100,000 degrees. They certainly do not support his 20 per cent, on average, cut to our universities, his cut to equity programs or his cut to research—the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have got the mark 3 legislation, even though the Minister for Education said that if it got defeated in March, he would give up. He has had a new lease of life and one can only assume that new lease of life is just to prop up the budget. Why else would the minister have said, 'We will abandon this legislation. We will not go ahead with that in March.' But now he continues to push ahead with it. It is because these big cuts are in the budget and those on the other side need to continue to prop up their budget and continue to try to make their budget look respectable. But, as the members behind me have said, they have doubled the deficit and that doubled deficit counts the savings; they have already banked the savings of this failed policy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this side of the House will not back down when it comes to mark 3 of the legislation. No matter how much spending on consultants and no matter how much spending on demon dialling and advertising to the Australian people, we will not move our resolve to block this legislation. Why? Why we block this legislation? Because it is fundamentally bad policy. It is terrible policy that will leave so many locked out of the Australian university sector and locked out of the higher education sector. It is fundamentally bad policy we are seeing. You only have to look across the world where this is happening to see that. We see in the US that there is $1.2 trillion worth of student debt. That is what is happening in the US. What we know is that debt in the US is stopping people from being able to buy a house and to actually start a small business. It is an impost on the economic contribution that they are making to the country.</span>

It is not surprising that he needs protection from the Australian people. I will stay on track, because I was pointing out that this is incredibly bad policy and it is time for the minister and the Prime Minister to give it up. The Prime Minister has had a bad week. There is no doubt about it; he has had a bad week. It has been a difficult time for him. My advice to him would be, if he wanted to turn his week around, to abandon this plan. He could come out tomorrow and say, 'This is a captain's pick.' One of the few popular captain's picks would be to abandon his plan for $100,000 degrees, because it absolutely bad policy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is losing friends very quickly. As I said, in the Group of Eight there are more and more vice-chancellors that are saying that this policy is not right. Of course, we have got the crossbench who is saying that nothing will move them, because it is fundamentally bad policy. We have each of those senators telling the minister that, so the question is: why do they pursue this? Why are they pursuing this unfair and unpopular package? It is time that they did listen to the Australian people and actually abandon this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the small time that I have left, I would like to say that the Labor Party stands in stark contrast. In Bluestocking Week, when we celebrate the contribution of women to higher education, we see that while the Liberal Party has $100,000 degrees, Labor has a clear program in which we will focus on STEM. We will focus on STEM because that is where the jobs of tomorrow will come from. Indeed, one of our policies—we have got a whole suite that I will not have time to go through—is that we will fund $100,000 STEM award degrees: $20,000 a year for five years, which will provide a financial incentive for students to enrol. We will focus on encouraging women to participate in that. It would be great to see those on the other side actually have a policy to address STEM and to attract women to STEM disciplines. Labor has a policy on this; the Liberal Party does not. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  Mr Speaker, may I congratulate you on your election to this high office. Labor are experts at peddling false information about the government's policies. As we know, they will suggest that we have cut things when we have in fact increased the funding. They peddle misinformation in relation to our industrial relations policy. They have a shameless, if not racist attack, on our free trade agreement with China. But perhaps the greatest misinformation, which they have been peddling now for close to 18 months, is this idea that our higher education policy would lead to $100,000 degrees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is perhaps the greatest misinformation that they have been peddling, because the implications of what they are saying and what they have been telling the Australian people is that if this higher education package passes through the Senate, then every single degree would cost $100,000 or more. They also suggest that that would be an up-front cost to boot on top of that. Not only is that misleading, not only is that wrong and not only is that factually incorrect but it is actually sending a very poor message to those people who are thinking about wanting to go into higher education. It is destroying their hopes and their aspirations. They are starting to believe that they will no longer be able to afford to go to university. That is the damage that the Labor Party is doing by peddling this falsehood that university degrees are all going to be $100,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to go through the facts of what we are actually proposing. What we are proposing—what we put forward through to this parliament—is to deregulate fees. As you probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker, at present there is a legal limit on what the universities can charge students. In essence, we were suggesting that we should remove that legal limit and leave it up to the university councils themselves as to what fee they should be charging university students. They would still be charging it completely through the HECS system—students would have no upfront costs, no fees that they would have to pay before they entered into that degree—but they would have the ability to set the fees, be it that they put them up or be it that they put them down. We would be entrusting the university councils, made up of the best and brightest minds in the nation, to set those fees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea there was that we would get a differentiation amongst the university sector. Some universities which are striving to be the very best in the world, such as the University of Melbourne, or a university like Monash or UNSW, may indeed put up their fees for some courses so that they can offer something very unique in the world. Other universities, for particular courses, may indeed drop their fees under such a model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But how do we know that Labor has in fact been telling falsehoods, and continues to tell falsehoods even to this very day about $100,000 degrees? How do we know this? We know this because we have been listening to what the universities themselves have been saying. I would actually like to go through this very slowly for the benefit of the opposition, so that they know what the universities themselves have been saying, given that it is the universities themselves who would be setting the fees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take a look: Queensland University of Technology issued their fee guidelines under a deregulated model on 5 December last year. Let's have a look at the proposed fees. A Bachelor of Nursing, which would be a three-year degree—how much do you think they would be suggesting for that? If you were listening to the member for Kingston and listening to the Labor Party, you would be thinking, 'Jeez, a Bachelor of Nursing at QUT in a deregulated fee environment, oh my goodness!' Let's have a look. A three-year degree: $31,800 at the max, and potentially only $21,400 at the minimum for three years. At the very most, it is less than $10,000 per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the Bachelor of Business, where you are likely to earn more money: somewhere between $32,300 for a three-year degree, with a maximum of $41,400. The most expensive course which they tabled—and they have tabled every single course and every single bachelor degree—is a 5½-year course, which is a double degree for a Bachelor of Business and a Bachelor of Laws, which in total would be between $61,000 and $78,000 at the absolute max. Again, where is the $100,000 degree for any of those courses under this? I would like to table this for the benefit of the Labor Party so that they can see that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go to the University of La Trobe. It is a university in my great state of Victoria. The University of La Trobe said that in 2015 they are offering a guarantee that their fees will not increase by more than 10 per cent above the regulated student contribution each year of their degree—an increase of only 10 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know what Open Universities Australia said? For the benefit of the gallery and of those people listening, they said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… we are confident that for numerous courses deregulation of fees will … lead to—</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at this from the Australian Technology Network head, Vicki Thomson, who looks after, I think, about 10 universities in Australia. The headline here is, 'Don't be fooled by "$100,000 degrees':</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">So let me repeat what has been said a million times: the university sector is not looking to introduce standard $100,000 degrees and deregulation won’t deliver them.</span>

                  </a>  The member for Kingston is interjecting over here, and it is difficult to hear with her interjections. Let me just go through it. If any university were going to increase their fees, you would think that it would be the Group of Eight universities—the so-called 'sandstone' universities. If anyone were going to increase their fees, you would think it would be them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's have a look at that. The University of Western Australia, as you know, says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Based on current legislation before the Federal Senate, UWA proposes to set an annual fee of $16,000 for domestic full-time students enrolled in its five undergraduate degree courses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">UWA is offering future students the opportunity to obtain a three-year undergraduate degree from one of the world's top 100 universities for less than $50,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I still cannot find the $100,000 number.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go on. I will table here the Group of Eight universities. Again, they have their indicative fees for all of the Group of Eight universities—that includes the University of Adelaide—and again it gets nowhere near the $100,000 degree which Labor shamelessly prosecutes day in and day out everywhere they go. And they have been doing this for such a long time. That is an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does the Labor Party do this? Why does the Labor Party peddle these falsehoods day in, day out? Is it because they are just blind to hearing this information? Have they not read this information which I have been talking about today? It is all in the public domain. Do they not believe these statements from the university vice-chancellors themselves? Do they not believe these statements? What is it? We know what it is. It is just pure and unadulterated politics. It is the politics of fear the Labor Party is spreading which is having the effect of killing the aspirations and the hopes of so many people across the community. They should absolutely be ashamed of themselves, as Vicki Thomson outlined perfectly.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know, the Labor Party used to be a reformist party. In the Hawke and Keating era, they were a reformist party. They introduced the HECS system. And we supported the introduction of the HECS system because it opened up so many more opportunities. And do you know what our package would do? It would do the same. It would open up 80,000 new opportunities for people, particularly at the associate degree level. It would open up so many more opportunities because we would be offering the biggest scholarship program in Australian history. That is what this package would do, and that is what the Labor Party are blocking. The Labor Party are peddling falsehoods and they should be ashamed of themselves. They are blocking opportunities for the Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="83S" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:38</span>):  I would be fascinated to know what the member said when he was the student president at university in the bygone days when HECS was introduced. I would like to dig that up—because I have got on record what Peter Costello said about HECS when he was the student president at Monash University. You may say that the Labor Party was once great. But I am not going to say that the Liberal Party was once great—it has never been great. And this week has been a complete demonstration that we cannot point to anything they have done that was reformist or good. This week we saw the astounding event of a six-hour party room meeting. In my 17 years in this place I have never seen the Labor Party sit through six hours of discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do I raise that? Because the Prime Minister said, quite rightly, that a lot of people who voted for the Liberal Party are going to feel dudded. Well, they feel a lot more dudded about this appalling legislation. This was an extraordinary statement from a Prime Minister who has already dudded every voter across this country. He has dudded every pensioner, every retiree, every hardworking low-and middle income family and women in particular around parental leave. Most importantly, he has dudded young people who are struggling to get an education—young people with hope and aspirations not based on their parents' income but on their ability to go to university. The Prime Minister wants to dramatically increase the out-of-pocket costs for every university degree and push some up as high as $100,000—and the Group of Eight have mentioned that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And why do we know this could happen? Because it has happened before. It happened under the Howard government when the maximum rate for HECS was introduced. Here is how one newspaper paraphrased the then education minister, Brendan Nelson, at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Education Minister Brendan Nelson has said that introducing fee flexibility would mean some course costs would rise, some would drop and others would stay the same, according to demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Does that sound vaguely familiar? Yes—because it is exactly what the current education minister has said. But did that happen? No, it did not. Here's what Dr Nelson said in an opinion piece he wrote at the time:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Some institutions may increase the tuition fees in some disciplines. Some institutions have already indicated they would like to reduce their fees or make no change at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what happened? Here is what Dr Nelson said during debate on his bill:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Some university vice-chancellors have already said that they will not be changing their HECS charges .... it is quite wrong for critics to say that every HECS charge is going up by 30 per cent …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sound familiar? Yes. And what happened? Everyone rose to the maximum amount of 30 per cent when there was a cap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deregulate and you all have to go to the maximum amount, especially when you are also taking away 20 per cent of the funding to universities. That is something that they took off the table—standing next to the Group of Eight—before this budget. And then it was miraculously back in the budget papers. We were told that the 20 per cent was going. We were told by the Prime Minister before he won the election that there would be no cuts to education. What a joke! What an out and out disgrace! What a lie!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also promised by the Minister for Education that they were not going to raise fees. But the first thing he introduced into this parliament was legislation to deregulate, which was automatically going to increase fees and take away 20 per cent of funding. Why is this so important to me? Because my electorate is home to over 50,000 university students at Monash and Clayton and the Deakin city campus at Burwood. I was at Deakin just the other day having a sausage sizzle with the students. Every one of them is concerned. They are not concerned about what we are telling them; they are concerned about what the university is not telling them. What is actually going to be the cost of their degree into the future? And it is not just for future students; it is for students now. Before, you probably would not have used higher education as a thing you would lobby on. But now everyone should have the aspiration for their child and for themselves to go to university. Deakin university will lose $157 million in funding over four years, and Monash will lose more. This will also reduce the ability to do research in this field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about STEM for the future? What about the kids at great institutions like Box Hill High in my electorate, which is an amazing STEM institution already? Already, 305 students who have graduated from Box Hill High have gone on to STEM courses. This is a local government high school that provides amazing science and maths courses. In particular, it runs a program for educating boys. It is an exciting place to be. But already the students there are concerned that they will never have the opportunity to go to university. They know that their parents have made sacrifices enough. How are the government going to get away with this? The Prime Minister should be sorry for dudding every student in this country— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But I know that is definitely the case here because the proposition in this MPI from members opposite is that deregulating the tertiary education sector would force universities into a position where they would charge $100,000 for degrees. We have heard 15 full minutes from members opposite of weird, wild and colourful spin. The only thing missing is one single solitary example of a $100,000 degree that they can stand up and put on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. Where is it?

                  </a>  Is that right? You cannot become a doctor or a lawyer by only doing a single undergraduate degree? I know that your maths is average, but let me put this to you—if you do a Bachelor of Economics and a Bachelor of Law at the University of Western Australia, how many degrees are you doing? One plus one is two. If you do a Bachelor of Law at Curtin University, when you have the ability to do that as an undergraduate, how many degrees are you doing at Curtin University? That would be one. I had taken it to mean, when you had advertised quite unfairly that there would be university degrees that would cost $100,000, that you were not adding up four or five or six university degrees. It is absolutely ridiculous. You fail at the first hurdle. There is not a single example of a $100,000 degree. There are posters everywhere, up and down the corridors—not a single example. The only other phenomenon that I can think—</span>

                  </a>  Is that at QUT? The Bachelor of Laws at QUT, in all their scenarios, is either under or just over $50,000. This is the officially released costings of the university. Do you know what the best modelling to determine what a university fee is going to be? That is the modelling that the university provides to the students who will be paying the fee. You would think it is pretty reputable modelling. I certainly think it is more reputable than silence. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

They publish what the fees will be. The University of Western Australia have undergraduate fees at about $50,000—from a Go8 and top 100 world university. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can only think of a few other phenomena where there is such an inverse proportionality between the sighting of the existence of the phenomenon and the actual evidence for it—this is the Big Foot of political debate, the Elvis sighting of political debate. I understand that Kalamazoo, Michigan, is where the greatest cluster of Elvis sightings has occurred. It is a great and sad thing, because it would have been Elvis's 80th birthday on 8 January this year, but the sad and real truth is that Elvis does not exist, and yet this myth of sightings of the great man lives on, even though the evidence is zero. There is absolutely no difference whatsoever. You have got as much chance, Members opposite, of producing the king here as of demonstrating that there will be a $100,000 degree.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  It was Oscar Wilde who had his character in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Winde</span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">mere's Fan</span> Lord Darlington say that a cynic was a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. You could say that those who put a blind faith in market forces, who think deregulation is an end in itself, suffer from the same hopeless mix of obsession and ignorance. And this government, in so many areas, has shown that same inclination to let the market loose, to let prices and profits reign in areas where prices and profits do not belong and to allow the often unfair, imbalanced and distorting effects of an improperly regulated market to cause harm to Australia's social fabric.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important aspects of our shared wellbeing, and indeed the defining features of the fair go in Australia, are the public goods we enjoy and maintain together—our public health and public education systems, our land and marine environments. Yet this government in all those areas wants to privatise and deregulate or else enable the private exploitation of those shared public goods. This is ideological madness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposed deregulation of university fees will take higher education further down the path to becoming a product to be advertised and sold to those with the greatest purchasing power. It will take university education further down the path of commodification and image marketing, and it will make Australia's productivity and innovation future subject to both personal and institutional economic self-interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities are not supermarkets, and degrees are not products to be produced at the cheapest cost and sold to the highest bidder. We are fortunate in Australia to be able to consider the path other nations have followed in comparable areas of public policy, and of course the United States is particularly relevant as a country that has favoured deregulation and the private-sector provision of health and education. On that point, it is interesting that last July, when Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz was asked to nominate the two biggest mistakes the government could make in taking Australia down the path of economic stagnation and widening inequality, he cited the deregulation of universities and the introduction of the Medicare co-payment. In stark contrast to the Minister for Education, who said Australia has much to learn from the United States, Mr Stiglitz said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Countries that imitate the American model are kidding themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Trying to pretend that universities are like private markets is absurd. The worst-functioning part of the US educational market at the tertiary level is the private for-profit system. It is a disaster. It excels in one area, exploiting poor children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If you're rich your parents can pay the fees, but if you are poor you are going to worry about how much debt you're undertaking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is a way of closing off opportunity and that's why the US doesn't have educational opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While we in the US are trying to re-regulate universities, you are talking about deregulating them. It really is a crime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what is at issue here—a proposal to make university education less accessible and less fair. It is absolute rubbish for people to claim that the use of the HECS or HELP loan schemes makes the level of fee irrelevant. Anyone with any experience of the real world, especially the real world of people in lower income families, would know that the prospect of taking on a large debt acts as a powerful disincentive. It will mean that young people who already question whether university is a feasible option choose not to back themselves and their talent and their potential, or else choose a cheaper option than the course to which they are best suited. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state we do not need to speculate about how the government's proposed deregulation would change the landscape, because there has already been a clear indication from the University of Western Australia about how it would respond. UWA announced that it would replace the current three-tier system of regulated fees, where the highest fee is $10,500, with a flat fee across its five bachelor degree streams of $16,000 a year </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That amounted to a price rise of 55 per cent for commerce students, 75 per cent for science students and 155 per cent for arts students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the reality in prospect under the Abbott government's deregulation agenda for Australian universities and Australian students—a massive jump in the cost burden and a massive barrier and disincentive for people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and from rural and regional areas, as I was, who already face additional challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some sympathy for the universities themselves—to the extent that the government is offering fee deregulation as a sop to cover huge cuts in funding to the sector. But I am glad that the uncritical and even unbridled enthusiasm of some universities has given way to a more sober assessment of the real effects and impacts of deregulation on education, equality of opportunity and fairness in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government's proposed funding cuts and fee deregulation for tertiary education in Australia have rightly been rejected by this parliament on two occasions; they represent another broken promise, another example of a government that wants to price everything but values nothing.</span>

In this case, it is student debt. This is a very rare thing we are debating. It is almost as rare as the $100,000 degrees that we are told about in the member for Kingston's MPI here. It says in the MPI that there are $100,000 degrees, and so it says on the posters that the Labor Party members put out the front of their offices here in Parliament House, along with all the propaganda that they are speaking to themselves about.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are these $100,000 degrees? We have looked high. We have looked low. The member for Aston has looked for them. The member who spoke earlier has looked for them. We have looked for them in the Group of Eight. We have looked for them in the sandstone universities. We looked for them in the University of Western Australia when it set its fees. We looked for them in QUT when it set its fees. I could look for them in the Regional Universities Network. One university that is a member of that is the Central Queensland University. They say:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Despite the scare campaign, we do not believe that $100,000 degrees will be a reality in the regions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, I am just going to check my drawer and see if there is a $100,000 degree in here. No, there are no 100,000 degrees in here. Perhaps you could check under your computers for me, Mr Deputy Speaker! Member for Aston, perhaps you could check in the dispatch box. Please, tell me if one of those $100,000 degrees is in there. We are having a hard time finding them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they exist, apparently. Where? In Labor Party modelling. The only place they exist is in modelling that those opposite have paid for. It might have been done by NATSEM, but everyone knows one thing about modelling: if you put rubbish in, you get rubbish out. That is exactly what these $100,000 degrees are—absolute rubbish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disgraceful that the Labor Party have come into this place and attacked the very fundamental thing we have in this country of university education that is accessible to all students. In doing so, they are undermining the system. They are undermining the system because they are going to make it financially unviable. When they come in here, their proposals all sound great. They came in here on the reply-to-the-budget night and the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We are going to make university degrees free for a bunch of people in the STEM—science, technology, engineering and maths—area.' It sounds great, but ultimately nothing is free. Someone has to pay. When we looked to see what the costs were, the first to come out was at 8.59 that Thursday night when the speech was delivered by the Leader of the Opposition. It came out in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>. They said, 'It is going to be $353.2 million.' That figure was too big, so the Labor Party ran around and shortly afterwards said, 'No, no. It's only $45 million.' There was a lot of confusion because these were numbers that were coming out of the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we heard from the Leader of the Opposition the next day on ABC Radio National that it was only $350 million. Then, again, later on in its FutureSmart Universities policy released that day they said it was going to be only $45 million. They went back and forth. They do not know the numbers. Then the next day in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> it was reported that it would be a $1.4 billion hit to the taxpayer and to the university system, making this university system unsustainable. And now they have the gall to come in here and lecture us about fictional $100,000 degrees when what we want to do is make the university system sustainable well into the future. Right now it is not and it certainly will not be if Labor come in and give out free degrees to people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The principles we have in the university system are right. You can basically put your degree on the credit card and pay it back when you have the capacity to do so. That is a great thing for students from all walks of life, from all socioeconomic groups, and it is something that should remain in place. The Labor Party should get on board with the deregulation we are proposing.</span>

Having won an election promising no cuts to education, the Prime Minister is determined to hit my local students and their families with $100,000 tertiary degrees. Just like the rest of the Australian public that have been repeatedly and comprehensively dudded by this Prime Minister on a whole raft of issues, my electorate is rightfully outraged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Calwell is one of the most disadvantaged electorates in the country. It traditionally has one of the lowest rates of participation in tertiary education. By substantially increasing university fees, the participation rate will deteriorate further. The government's $100,000-degree fiasco is happening at a time when my local school and parent communities as well as myself as the federal member, the state members and the local council have been working very hard to encourage our young people to stay in school and to give them the confidence to believe that they can go on to higher learning. A lot of this work is now at risk, and it is work that comes on the back of massive investments in my electorate from previous state and federal Labor governments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the progressive and social justice policies of past Labor governments, we have built an education infrastructure in Calwell that we are very proud of. We have created an environment where our kids love learning and have the confidence to remain in school and aspire to realise their full potential. In fact, we encourage them to do so at all levels. </span>

In my electorate there are many young people who have the necessary skills, intelligence and determination to contribute to society in great and various ways by becoming doctors, lawyers, scientists and educators, to name but a few. I visit my schools and talk to my local students, who tell me about their plans and what they hope to become some day, and a large number of them want to go to university. Yet I believe that the government, with its proposed university cuts, is stealing their dreams.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think of how $100,000 degrees are going to affect my community, I think of a new and emerging community, the Iraqi community. They came here as refugees, and a great number of them are tertiary qualified. In fact, I had the pleasure of attending the 80th birthday party of the first female dentist in Iraq, who resides in my electorate. She is just one example of the many members of this community who took every opportunity available to them in their home country of Iraq to complete higher education and become successful members of society. This community place a high premium on education and they want the same opportunities they had in Iraq for their children here in their new home, Australia. But $100,000 degrees will make this very difficult if not impossible, because these are not wealthy people. They are people who are trying to establish themselves in Australia by finding a job, and their priority is to provide for their families in addition to their children's education. In fact, most families in my electorate are struggling to make ends meet. So imagine what the additional burden of $100,000 degrees will do, not just to the family budget, but to their aspirations for their children.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Rudd-Gillard years, we significantly increased the number of Commonwealth supported places at universities for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The university in my electorate that is attended by a large number of students is La Trobe University. As a result of the previous Labor government increasing the number of Commonwealth supported places, a number of my local students were given the opportunity to attend this university; many were the first in their families to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's budget proposes to cut over $136 million to La Trobe University's Commonwealth Grant Scheme over the next four years. I can only imagine what this will do to the opportunities for my young people to attend La Trobe University—and other universities, for that matter. In the process of slashing funds to universities, Minister Pyne claims that the government's higher education changes will benefit students from low socioeconomic backgrounds because, as he says, they will create more places for brighter kids from these backgrounds. This is a con job, because the proposed Commonwealth Scholarships Program will not receive Commonwealth funding. Instead, this program will be funded entirely by student fees. So, whilst indeed the program may be of benefit to a limited number of students who meet the criteria, it is not an answer for those who miss out because of capping or eligibility criteria. My community will still be left with students who will not be able to access higher education, because they will miss out. This is truly an extraordinary and heartbreaking waste of potential, not just for— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLIAMS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  What we have not heard in this discussion this afternoon is what is best for the university sector, what is best for the students of our country and what is best for the future of Australia. The opposition has conveniently neglected to address these issues. In reflecting on some of the things that universities have said about changes they would like to see in the way they operate, I will quote a few of their leaders. The peak body representing Australia's universities says that the reforms are a 'once in a generation opportunity' to shape a higher education system that is 'sustainable, affordable and equitable' for students of the nation. Universities Australia Chief Executive Belinda Robinson said failure of the package will condemn the university system to 'inevitable decline'. The Vice-Chancellor of the ANU said it would be 'a great tragedy for our nation, for our universities, for our future generations' if this opportunity were passed up. Over the last year we have heard former Labor members like Gareth Evans, John Dawkins and Maxine McKew, and the list goes on, endorsing a change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that universities in Australia are facing great challenges. They are facing competition from the ever-powerful universities around the world, particularly in Asia, including China. They know that the system needs to change to give them a better chance to succeed, a better chance to operate their universities the way they want to and a better chance to determine their own future. We know the government is not increasing fees. We know that, through competition, universities will be forced to set reasonable fees. We have heard a lot about $100,000 degrees. My good colleagues, whether the member for Dawson or the member for Pearce, have clearly articulated that there is no evidence for that. As the member for Pearce said, it is like the sighting of Elvis—all myth and no evidence, no reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Kingston raised the issue of STEM—science, technology, engineering and mathematics. She failed to acknowledge that the federal government has been investing considerably in STEM in recent years. There is an extra $12 million to restore focus and increase students' uptake of science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects in primary and secondary schooling across the country. This builds on another $5 million program. So we are committed to STEM—always have been, always will be. If you commit to something, it is important that you get the costings right. We have heard about Labor's costings for surpluses. Just recently the member for Dawson raised their costings for their HECS subsidisation. We know their costings bounced around numerous figures, whether $350 million or $42 million, and the media just tore this part. There is a lack of credibility to their costings. They were done on the run, with very little thought. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are running a scare campaign on this issue. I go back to what has been said by universities themselves. The Queensland University of Technology have released the modest fee increases that there would be under a deregulated system, with degrees in science and nursing costing just under $30,000, and their business-law double degree, 'one of the best in the country', would be $14,272 a year for 5½ years. That is evidence that there is no credibility to these claims of $100,000 degrees. That is Labor, again: scare campaigns, falsehoods, lack of credibility on costings and on policy. They have talked about policy a lot, but all we have is their wish list for subsidisation of degrees in which they could not even get the costings right, whereas we have moved on to what is really needed for our nation in terms of the reforms that are required to drive the university sector forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just universities that are backing this; it is our industries and the key leaders of our business councils, such as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They have all submitted their recommendations on the need to change our higher education system for the future of our country because we need to compete in a new world, in a new space, with a knowledge based economy. The skills of our future generations need a change in structure and support, and that is what these reforms would offer if they are allowed to proceed. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Coalition MPs are claiming that $100,000 degrees do not exist. If they seriously are saying that these degrees will not become a reality under their overhaul of the higher education system, then they should release their own modelling, the modelling that they have refused to release for over a year. I have said previously that today's young people have the misfortune to face an axis of financial evil: job insecurity, housing unaffordability and student debt. It is their particular misfortune to have an education minister who does not give a continental about their financial hardship. Nor does he care about maintaining academic standards and the reputations of our universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Liberal government succeeds in its plan to deregulate university fees, we will have achieved the complete opposite of the system in the 1970s, when places were allocated on the basis of academic merit. Academic merit and performance will count for nothing. Your financial capacity—or, more accurately, your parents' capacity—to pay large fees will count for everything. Under that system, what point would there be in working hard during year 12? Of what value would be the marks of students past who have worked hard and did well in year 12? Good luck to the year 12 teachers, and secondary teachers generally, trying to encourage their students to do the hard yards and finish secondary school!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is no scare campaign. With higher university fees, uncapped places and the reliance on overseas students, we are already seeing universities stray far from their original, noble purpose of being seekers after truth and educators of young minds. Now many of them regard making a profit as their core objective and behave like Coles and Woolworths. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of Wollongong bought a table at a Liberal Party fundraising breakfast in Sydney in 2011, paying $1,000 to do so. The New South Wales Auditor-General reported in 2015 that three universities had made political donations since 2008, and the Auditor-General describe this as an 'inappropriate use of public moneys' and recommended policies to prohibit political donations from universities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncapped places and deregulated fees are just another free-market dream that will give us declining academic quality and increasing social inequality. Indeed, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption says that universities are now so financially reliant on international students that they are unable to fully confront academic incompetence and poor language skills, plagiarism or even bribery. ICAC says in its report:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no simple solution that will effectively eliminate the gap between the capabilities of the students and the academic demands of the universities, and no easy way to eliminate the corruption pressures created by the gap.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">For students entering universities with low levels of English, false entry qualifications or financial pressures to work rather than study, cheating in some form or another will often be seen as an easy solution for passing the course.</span>

It also quoted current and former academics, who said that plagiarism was being ignored in universities and that there were strong internal pressure in universities to pass failing students. University of Queensland Professor Paul Frijters said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Zena O'Connor, a lecturer in the architecture, design and planning faculty at the University of Sydney, said the university's response when told that plagiarism had increased sharply was, 'Thank you for your feedback.' </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is regrettable that students are now under such pressure, with high fees and a shortage of graduate jobs, that they are driven to cheat. It is a clear sign that we have taken a wrong turn in relation to tertiary education. If we deregulate student fees, as the minister proposes, this government will be shamelessly selling out our young people and fitting them up for unprecedented levels of student debt. It is a scandalous way to treat our young people. Despite all the bluff and bluster on the government benches, there is absolutely no doubt that fee deregulation will lead to substantial fee hikes, as has occurred everywhere else it has been done. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  To Labor members opposite, who think that a scare campaign is just a bit of fun—I have seen the laughter that has gone on today as part of this debate—I say: you have to be very careful what you wish for because, when you get it, it may be different to what you expect. Yes, your scare campaign about $100,000 university degrees might have looked like a bit of fun to you, but it certainly did not to the students in rural and regional Australia. That campaign actually has scared some young people; you got what you wished for. There are young people who have changed their minds about their future education opportunities because of your scare campaign. If that was Labor's intent, I am appalled. But that is exactly what it has done. I had a recent higher education forum, and that was some of the feedback that I got—that the campaign about $100,000 fees has actually prevented some young people from taking up their higher education opportunities. That is exactly what is going on. If young regional and rural students were not facing challenges, here is another one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw what Labor did when they changed the criteria for youth allowance, given the challenges facing rural and regional students with accommodation. This is not their first go at this. We saw the effect on a whole lot of young rural and regional students during those early Labor years. And here they are still at it. That is the bit that I find particularly appalling. It is having an impact. That is the cruel personal cost of this type of campaign. It may have looked like a political opportunity—and they are very proud of those posters—but what is the human cost? Did they ever think of the human cost to a young person who has limited funds and a family in a small regional community that is already struggling to support them to go away from home and study? When they see those headlines—'$100,000 university fees'—what does that do to that family? I do not think Labor even gave any thought to what that might do to the aspirations of younger people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, universities in Australia have always come at a financial cost to students. Until 1974 university fees were the norm, and governments of both persuasions had policies and plans to make tertiary education available to as many people as possible. A Curtin Labor government increased the number of university graduates. In response it increased the number of scholarships funded by the Commonwealth. The Menzies Liberal government invested in higher education, especially in sciences, investing heavily in additional universities to cater for increased demand. Menzies also increased scholarships, and the coalition created a new category of federally funded tertiary institutions called colleges of advanced education, to provide even more bachelor-level degrees. Of course that very least respected Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, abolished university fees, and then Bob Hawke had to make a different decision and he introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments from both sides of politics—the rational ones anyway—believe that students need to make a contribution towards their own higher education. Both sides have a system where government funds the up-front cost, and the beneficiaries, the students themselves, are given the capacity to pay off their debt over time, as their income allows. This makes sure that all students have the same capacity to absorb and pay off higher education fees. But, as I said earlier, we should note that not all students have the same access to tertiary education. Those from a regional and rural area face accommodation and other costs that often are not part of what a student from a metropolitan area faces.</span>

Those young people will come back to regional areas and be part of our future. That is exactly what we want to ensure. That is what the additional scholarships were about in our plan, and that is exactly what Labor have voted against.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I am indeed honoured and humbled to participate in this discussion of the 100th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli, on the motion moved by the honourable Prime Minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One hundred years ago, Turkey repulsed the British and French fleet at Canakkale, decisively ending their attempt to force the straits. Four days later, the fateful decision was made to commit to an amphibious landing at Gallipoli. From this vantage point 100 years later, the Gallipoli campaign marked a turning point in the history of two nations that have been together ever since, Australia and New Zealand. For the great imperial powers of Europe, locked in the lethal stalemate on the Western Front, Gallipoli was in fact something of a sideline. A fleet of obsolete vessels and a relatively small force, reinforced by untested colonials, would attempt to break the stalemate by reopening a sea route to the Russians in the Black Sea, thus drawing Turkish troops away from Caucasian theatre of operations. It ultimately failed this objective. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the Anglo-French perspective, the campaign that we commemorate the centenary of this year at Gallipoli was merely one failed attempt to break the stalemate in Europe. For the Ottoman command, the campaign was critical to prevent the opening-up of a new front that they could ill afford. From this perspective, the successful defence of Gallipoli should have been a victory that ensured the survival of the Ottoman Empire. But, with the clear-eyed hindsight of history, we can see this campaign today in a very different light. To the fledgling nations of Turkey, Australia and New Zealand, this encounter—this great battle at Gallipoli—is now remembered as a critical juncture in the birth of independent nationhood. Indeed, for the Turks under Kemal Ataturk, since regarded as the father of modern Turkey, it was the beginning of a new nation. Far from being a failure, this was the campaign in which Australia and New Zealand proved to the world and to themselves that they could survive the withering heat of modern warfare. As we look back it is sometimes difficult to remember how modern that warfare was. The First World War was the war which included the last cavalry charges in history and it was the war that included aeroplanes for the first time; it included people on bicycles and people in a modern invention, the tank. It was a critical juncture in warfare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this great historical irony, what appeared to be a great victory for the Ottoman Empire was in fact a watershed moment for the nationalist movement that was to replace it. For Australia's official war historian, Charles EW Bean, 25 April 1915 was the day 'the consciousness of Australian nationhood was born.' Bean made it clear that the Australians did not fight because of any hatred of the Turks; rather, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…the big thing in the war for Australia was the discovery of the character of Australian men. It was character which rushed the hills at Gallipoli and held on there …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was that same recognition of the character of so many from this country who died in that Great War that was commemorated by hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people around Australia on Anzac Day and in events surrounding Anzac Day this year. My electorate was no different from the electorates of all the other members of this place. At the dawn service at Warrandyte some 3,500 to 4,000 members of the local community came out to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac. At the morning service at the Templestowe RSL, some 3,000 people came out—numbers significantly more than the services at which large numbers of people turn up each other year. At the Doncaster RSL dawn service, some 2,500 people attended. Even at the Donvale Rehabilitation Hospital there were some 200 people, compared to maybe 50 on other occasions. Throughout the electorate, at local football ovals there were services during the day, and at the Croydon RSL some 3,000 people attended the dawn service. I would like to place on record our appreciation for the presidents, the chairs, the committees and the office bearers of each of those RSLs who year after year organise these memorial events. I thank Hank Vanderhelm who was standing in for John Pearson at Warrandyte, Michael Flanagan at Templestowe, Charles Collins at Doncaster and Sam Berrie at Croydon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time in 24 years I was not able to attend the services in my own electorate because I was representing the government on Anzac Day at the Western Front, which I will come to the moment. When I returned after having been in Europe for Anzac Day I organised a morning tea at the Doncaster RSL to which I invited members of the Returned Services League branches and various organisations in the district, and we had some 80 or so people in attendance on that day. It was my opportunity to say to them on behalf of a grateful nation and particularly on behalf of the constituents of Menzies how much we appreciate the ongoing work that they do. It is not just Anzac Day each year—it is Remembrance Day and the commemoration of other events such as the Battle of Long Tan. They also do ongoing work, particularly for veterans and their families, through Legacy and other organisations in the electorate. It is something that we in this country can be very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I was honoured to represent the government on Anzac Day at the Western Front, particularly at the service at Villers-Bretonneux, where some 7,000 people withstood the cold, driving rain before dawn and at dawn. Most of them walked back the three or four kilometres into the small village of Villers-Bretonneux, where the mayor had provided a breakfast, and then there was a town service in Villers-Bretonneux. There was also a wonderful concert of schoolchildren from not only Villers-Bretonneux but also other villages around the area. The Australian government helps to fund that and gives out a number of awards to students each year. It was wonderful to see the local students singing <span style="font-style:italic;">Waltzing Matilda</span> as well as other Australian songs in their repertoire at that town service. We later drove for some two hours and stopped in the middle of a field which was once the bloody, muddy fields of World War I where the locals in the 1920s erected a small cross called Le Petit Croix, where each year representatives of the government of Australia stop along with local French men and women to commemorate the First World War, before going onto Bullecourt—another scene of ferocious fighting during the First World War—where 2,000 to 3,000 people, mostly Australians and New Zealanders, were in attendance. By then it was a warm afternoon on the Somme for the town service, which involved the commemoration of both Australian and local French fighters in the First World War, and that was followed by a march of about a kilometre or so out to the Bullecourt Digger memorial, in the fields where the fronts were in the First World War, for that service. We concluded the day by driving to Ypres in Belgium where there is that famous service at Menin Gate which has been held every night of the year for decades. Again, there were thousands of people gathered there on that occasion for that service to mark the special time of Anzac Day. I was privileged to be at Menin Gate, along with my counterpart the Minister of Defence from New Zealand, the Hon. Gerry Brownlee, to lay wreaths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On all of these occasions, whether it was overseas at the Western Front, whether it was the people who went to Gallipoli, whether it was local services in your electorate and my electorate, Mr Speaker, hundreds of thousands of Australians turned out because this was such a significant occasion in the history of this country, and it is so important for this parliament to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  Congratulations, Mr Speaker, on your appointment as Speaker of this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the Abbott government rushes to sign free trade agreements and the TPP, it unwisely dismisses the groundswell of critics who constructively argue that such agreements do not deliver the exaggerated benefits claimed and, even worse, can be detrimental to many sectors of the Australian economy. Those critics are not radical minorities but include conservative politicians, respected economic analysts and even the Productivity Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that free-flowing trade between nations has meant that more people have easier access to more products and that removing trade barriers has very likely delivered considerable benefits to people around the world. It also means that inefficient businesses will not survive unless they change. However, attributing trade benefits solely to free trade agreements in an ever-changing world can also lead to flawed conclusions. The world is much different today to what it was a decade ago and different again to each decade before that. The internet, rapid communication and faster transport means that consumers know what is happening and what is available around the world. Governments that continue to put up barriers to consumers buying what they want from where they want will quickly find themselves on the wrong side of their voters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the USA, China and Japan were all major Australian trading partners well before the signing of FTAs. I also note that the lower Australian dollar has overshadowed tariff reductions committed to in FTAs, and, as we are seeing with China right now, some countries continue to manipulate their currencies in order to influence trade. A rising middle class has most likely done more to lift Australia's trade with Asia than FTAs. Interestingly, beef sales to Vietnam and China rose sharply without FTAs. Furthermore, there is little evidence that FTAs signed in recent years have been of significant benefit to Australia. What they have done, however, is to add more obstructions and compliance obligations on traders and limitations on Australian autonomy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, the evidence is mounting that the major beneficiaries of FTAs are global transnationals and economic superpowers, who seem determined to control world markets. The use of investor state dispute settlement clauses—ISDS clauses, as they are otherwise known—in agreements is an example of the growing power of multinationals. These clauses enable foreign companies to sue governments if a change of law affects the investment of a company. It is a right that is not available to domestic entities. That, in itself, is an absurd, discriminative proposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as foolish, national sovereignty is lost and democratically elected governments lose the right to make laws and decisions that the people may want. This is not exaggerated scaremongering. It is happening right now, with Phillip Morris using a 1993 agreement between Australia and Hong Kong to sue Australia for profits lost because of Australia's plain-packaging cigarette laws. That case has already been running for four years. To date, it has cost a reported $50 million—and it is still far from over. There are also claims the Victorian government's attempts to support local industries and use Australian steel in government projects breaches FTAs with Japan, Korea and the USA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not alone with these dilemmas. Over 608 ISDS cases have been taken out in recent years, and the numbers are rapidly escalating—driven, in part, by law firms that do very well out of them. Of those cases, around a third fail and the rest are either settled out of court or won by the companies. Even worse, the cases are generally secretive, not subject to the normal judicial rules of law and are heard by a panel of three selected arbiters. How any government could trade away its sovereignty by entering into such agreements bewilders me and the people I speak with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, several governments are now wanting to review the ISDS process. Former Prime Minister Howard, to his credit, would not allow an ISDS clause in the Australia-United States FTA. With every agreement there are winners and losers. Governments trade off the future of one industry sector and the jobs of thousands of Australians against that of another. It is a trade-off that simply does not sit comfortably with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two other serious concerns that I want to refer to. Firstly, FTAs may extend patent periods, thereby preventing lower-cost generic products from entering the Australian market. Secondly, under the ChAFTA, foreign labour may be brought into Australia to fill jobs that could otherwise be done by Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 28 July I hosted a very well-attended public forum on trade agreements in my electorate. The views and concerns I have outlined reflect the overwhelming views of those people who attended on the night. The government should not be so dismissive of public sentiment on these matters and should take note of the serious concerns that have been raised throughout the community with respect to free trade agreements and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250077" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VARVARIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  The St George Business Awards is an annual event in the Barton electorate that celebrates the businesses in this wonderful community. I was really pleased to be able to attend this year, along with my wife, to meet all the finalists and the winners, and to present several categories of awards. It is such a great honour to attend an event such as this in my capacity as the federal member, to help celebrate the hard work of the region's many diverse enterprises. As we all know, small businesses are the backbone of our nation. They are the engine room of our economy. That night, I saw our nation's ethos all around the room in the Venus Reception Centre—that if you have a go, you can succeed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barton has some 13,000 businesses dedicated to serving the community and beyond. They range from automotive services, personalised services, professional services, hospitality and catering through to health, child care and community based organisations. Many of these businesses are family owned and run by people who work long hours and work tirelessly to retain their customers day in, day out. These businesses are also under pressure from other similar organisations or online based enterprises offering similar goods. Yet these businesses have survived the ebbs and flows of the economy and battle on each day to provide something invaluable for the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They do not ask for much in return, except to be left alone to run their operations according to the needs they have identified. This means not being burdened by red tape, excessive bureaucracy and spending days in the office pushing paperwork, as opposed to developing and nurturing client and business relations. They want a fair go because they have neither the time nor the resources like big organisations have to dedicate to compliance, accounts keeping, recruitment, advertising and marketing, sales and so forth. For many organisations, the owner and manager is one and the same, the marketer and human resources manager is one and same and the accountant and customer service manager is also one and the same, or within a lean team. Yet, their economic contributions to the local Barton economy and Australia cannot be underestimated. All these businesses want recognition of their hard work and appreciation of their needs in the policies we develop to further assist them, not hinder them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The St George Business Awards is also an excellent opportunity for me to personally speak to many businesses in a celebratory environment, to catch up and see how they are going. Of course, it is a great opportunity to let them know what the coalition is doing to further their entrepreneurial spirit and how we are encouraging them with opportunities of growth and investment rather than burdening them with new rules and legislation that stifle their potential. The budget this year has an outstanding small business package designed to help grow the economy and create jobs. We understand the value of small businesses in the Barton community. This can be said of most small businesses across the country: often they are small enterprises operating locally and employing locally. These organisations need and want greater incentives to continue doing what they love, including tax relief and tax deductions for assets purchased and also access to resources to help run their organisations more efficiently or to mitigate commercial or contractual issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that this side of government has been vital in delivering a multitude of small business packages that will assist organisations in many ways, including a cut of 1.5 per cent for incorporated small businesses and five per cent for unincorporated. Small businesses can also claim an immediate tax deduction for every asset purchased up to the value of $20 000. For example, Shelley, from Admire Florist in Bexley North, the winner of the St George Business Awards in 2014, can now acquire new vans and computers to keep up with local and online demand. In fact, when I visited Shelley's business recently with the Treasurer, she was more than happy to reiterate what a help the small business package in this year's budget has meant for her floristry. Similarly, when we visited Macchina coffee shop in Kingsgrove, the owner, Harry, confirmed exactly what the budget meant for his growing enterprise—in this instance, new cashiers, a new coffee machine, grinder and so forth. Being able to deduct the asset amount straightaway can make a world of difference to small businesses, which are the lifeline of local communities. To be able to reduce tax burden and assist in revenue mean more investment back into the business and stability for its employees. These small business owners are extraordinary individuals. They have taken a risk in bettering their lives and that of their families, and they deserve to be rewarded with adequate support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, my congratulations and best wishes for this year's St George Business Award winners: Patrizi Motors; Specialist Laser Clinics, Sir Braxton Chocolate Bar, 3 Bridges Community, A Touch of Salsa, Lashings at Brighton, The Pilates Room, All Seasons Fruit Market, Expressions Hair Culture, Sole Therapy, Laser Logic Clinic, Terry White Chemists Kogarah, Argy Property, Omeros on the Beach, Form Interiors, Divani Ladies Fashion and Joshua Gallagher—ACTiv Elite Performers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know parliament is a contest of ideas and that that contest should be rigorous and robust. But the contest should not be personal and it does not need to be a blood sport. Canberrans have told me time and time again that they want more policy and less posturing in parliament—and I agree. I am worried that the current uncivil discourse in Australian politics and also in some other sectors, particularly in the social media community, is causing people to disengage with the political process. In an age that is more connected than ever, in an era where that connectedness is meant to enhance democracy, Australians now seem to be more disengaged and disillusioned with our democracy and, through that, disenfranchised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's Lowy Institute poll of Australian attitudes found that just 49 per cent of 18- to 29-year-olds say 'democracy is preferable to any other kind of government', and 26 percent believe it does not matter what kind of government we have. And last year's Plan International Australia survey of 1,000 young women and girls on sexism found that one per cent or less wanted a career in politics. These are disturbing findings and, I believe, a sign that the bile-filled national debate and uncivil discourse and behaviour has alienated many. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The responsibility to improve the pitch and tone of debate rests with all of us. We, as leaders, must behave decently and respectfully to each other. We need to call out unacceptable behaviour when we see it and put an end to personal attacks. Ultimately, we need to change the culture of public discourse in this country. I acknowledge that this will be hard, and it will be confronting. But politicians, the media and the community have been the first to call for cultural change in our schools, in the corporate world, in our boardrooms, in our cultural, sporting, academic and religious institutions, in the public service and in the Australian Defence Force. There has been a call for an end to bullying and harassment, for an end to sexism, for an end to discrimination, for an end to the 'boys clubs' and instead a call for greater diversity. Each of these institutions is responding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As shadow parliamentary secretary for defence and as someone who consulted in Defence for nearly a decade, I know that organisation is making significant changes to develop an inclusive culture, to stamp out unacceptable behaviour at every level, from the Australian Defence Force Cadets, to ADFA, to RMC through to the senior management and the top brass. The best example of that is not just David Morrison's 'Get Out' speech but also last year's speeches by the incoming chiefs, where inclusiveness was the predominant theme. Yet, curiously, we politicians are particularly quiet when it comes to the need for cultural change here, in this institution—parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I call on all of us to accept that we need to change the nature of public discourse in this parliament, because I am very worried that those young women and girls—that possible 99 per cent—who may dream about influencing public policy through a career in politics are frightened that they too may one day be victims of trolls on social media, vilified through Facebook, or bullied or harassed. I worry that those women do not seek to be engaged in public policy and the political process, because of fears of being bullied and harassed. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207800" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WHITELEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  Mr Speaker, this is my first opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to the post of Speaker: well done. Often when we think of Anzac Day, we think of the contribution that RSLs make in helping the wider community remember the service of Defence Force personnel, and they do do a great job. But just as important as the older generation's continued contribution to this important task is that of our children. The Anzac Day Schools' Awards are designed to encourage initiative and creativity in the way that schools commemorate Anzac Day, with an emphasis on inventiveness balanced with tradition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I congratulate three schools in Braddon, which have received an Anzac Day School's Award. In particular, Latrobe Primary School, which received the Anzac Day Schools' Award for the grade 4 to 6 students' 3D poppy display and research into the journeys of the Australian and New Zealand soldiers from Albany to World War One battlefronts. I take the opportunity to congratulate all the teachers and students of that school for ensuring that the contribution of all those who have served our nation will never be forgotten. In recognition of the award, Latrobe Primary School will receive a certificate, a winner's plaque and $2,000 prize money, and I congratulate them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further representing Braddon is St Joseph's Primary School in Rosebery, which was runner up for the Anzac Day Schools' Award for grades 5 and 6, and Marist Regional College, which was awarded a highly commended certificate in the Tasmanian high schools award. St Joseph's is a small school of just 92 students. With the encouragement and support of the entire community, they took a vacant shopfront and turned it into a display for their artwork and research, amongst many other things. It is wonderful to see this young people being engaged in this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move on to another matter: the attitude that mobile phone service is a luxury in our community is long gone. It is one of the most basic telecommunication services, on which most have come to rely, and that is no different in the electorate of Braddon. That is why the 2013 election commitment from the Liberals that they would spend $100 million on boosting mobile phone coverage throughout the country was so warmly welcomed. Many areas in my electorate have been covered by recent announcements, but of course we know that there are more black spots. I am so pleased that the government has announced a further $60 million to address this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have already encouraged communities in my electorate to contact me seeking my support for their local black spot to be fixed. One such community is the residents in Sulphur Creek, Heybridge and Preservation Bay. These areas are some of the most idyllic locations on the north west and residents are immensely proud of their small towns, apart from one small thing—the poor or non-existent mobile phone coverage. Like residents in other small towns throughout the country, they rely on mobile phone coverage to conduct business, to keep in contact with family and friends, and for emergencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank Mr Brian Britt for his work in compiling a lengthy petition of residents. This petition calls on the government to include Sulphur Creek, Heybridge and Preservation Bay in the program. At the end of my contribution, I will table this petition, which has met the requirements of the petitions committee and has been approved for tabling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I again had the privilege to offer the federal government's support to local north-west sporting champions. Local sport is integral to the community and the benefits are felt widely, not only by the sportsmen and sportswomen but by the officials, family and friends. While it is important to focus on the health and community benefit of sport, sometimes people have exceptional gifts in sport and the opportunity to represent their community on the state, national or international stage. This was the case with 16 young men and women that I recently presented with $500 to meet the costs of them competing. In this place, I congratulate publicly: Gabrielle Turley, representing basketball; Caitlin Radford, equestrian; Semra Peach gymnastics; Mia Cooper, hockey; David Gardiner, horse riding; Erin Percy, netball; Mia Luttmer, soccer; Oliver Malley, swimming; Patrick Roberts, swimming; Nicholas Plats, swimming; Ethan Stratton, also swimming; Beau Bramich, touch football; Emily Turner, touch football; Zoe Groves, hockey; and Luis Wilson, canoeing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These young people do us proud. When they speak at these presentations, they speak well. They genuinely appreciate the support of their parents, in particular, for driving them around—as we know and as we do as parents. They are extremely grateful often for the volunteer efforts of the coaches that provide the experience and the support that they need. I congratulate them in this place for the effort they show. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I present that petition. </span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of residents and visitors of Sulphur Creek on the North-West Coast of Tasmania draws to the attention of the House, the lack of mobile phone coverage at Sulphur Creek and the difficulty this causes residents and business owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to consider allocating funding under the next round of the Liberal Coalition's Mobile Phone Black Spot funding programme to the Heybridge, Preservation Bay and Sulphur Creek community to ensure all residents and visitors have access to essential services.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="L6P" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MacTIERNAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I raise serious concerns that we are fighting the war on terror with the wrong weapons and that elements of the proposed changes to the citizenship legislation are actually damaging our ability to deal with radicalisation in our community. During the winter recess, I held in my electorate a community forum on citizenship laws. We were particularly—but not exclusively—focusing on those provisions of the legislation that give ministers the right to: firstly make a determination of fact that a person has engaged in certain behaviour; then, secondly, make a determination that that amounts to an act of terrorism; and, thereafter, advise a person that they have had their citizenship revoked, where they were dual citizens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are deeply concerned about this. In my electorate, some 45 per cent of my constituents are born overseas and there will be many who are—as I was—not aware that they are dual citizens. It was only when I nominated for federal parliament that I discovered that I was automatically an Irish citizen because my father had been born in Ireland. The issue that I want to focus on today is the very disturbing evidence presented there that social cohesion has been breaking down, in part because of these proposed changes. We had a very powerful presentation from Dr Zarrin Siddiqui from Pakistanis in Australia, who have been an absolutely magnificent group in Western Australia, providing very positive role models for women and showing how a modern Islam is completely compatible with Australian culture, values and mores.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Zarrin Siddiqui pointed out that already members in her community have become very hesitant about providing evidence to authorities on odd behaviour, because of the profound consequences that could result from this. Even if this turned out not to be something that was able to be substantiated as being in fact terrorist behaviour, there was that threat that citizenship could be lost. So there is this hesitancy about the traditional dialogue that has been taking place between these communities and the authorities, including the Australian Federal Police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were also told that Muslim families who have traditionally gone to non-Muslims schools are now moving to Muslim schools, because they fear being spied on, every aspect of teenage behaviour will be dwelt on and people making complaints. We have created a culture of fear. We learnt of Muslim families who were deciding that they wanted to move into areas where there were more other Muslim families so that they felt protected. We are ensuring that that great goodwill that has been part of our Australian community is in fact being brought under threat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An extraordinary example was raised at the forum, where Muslim people now feel that they do not have the same political rights. A case was quoted where a man, who was an Australian citizen but of Muslim faith, was seeking a security clearance from work. He was asked in that process if he had attended any political protests and he nominated three peaceful meetings he had been to, including a candlelight vigil in relation to the war in Gaza. He was then denied his security clearance. There is this growing fear within the Islamic community that they are no longer entitled to participate fully in political life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />This is of deep concern. We must, of course, combat home-grown radicalisation; we need to act. But what we are doing with these proposed changes in citizenship laws is indeed creating an us and them. We are inciting, I believe, Islamic people to lose confidence in Australia's commitment to incorporating them into our community as an integral part of the community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241590" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I also commend you and congratulate you on your selection as Speaker. Today in this House stands a single white rose. It is a poignant reminder of a great community leader, the honourable member for Canning, who died of a heart attack doing what he loved. Today, I want to rise to pay tribute to another great community member in my electorate, Mickey Dean, who also recently died of a heart attack while playing football, which was a game that he loved. He was only 47.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He scored the goal of the match in the first half, with some of his family members looking on. His dad told that he was proud of him. At half-time, he came off the field and during the second half of the match he collapsed and died of a heart attack. Even though there was a paramedic there, who was actually playing on the field with him, they were unable to save him. He was another great man taken all too suddenly from his family, his friends and his community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I never knew Mickey, but I really wish I had. He was a coach, an active member of the Southern &amp; Ettalong United Football Club, the deputy captain of the Bays Rural Fire Service, a former surf lifesaver and a man who served in the Army Reserve for 15 years. He was a man who was described at his funeral, held yesterday, as an outstanding role model with an extraordinary legacy of love, compassion, love for life and exuberance. Last Sunday, I joined about 400 people who stood in a minute's silence for Mickey on James Browne Oval at Woy Woy. I was honoured to meet his wife, Peta, and to meet his parents. I extend my deepest sympathy to his parents; his wife, Peta; and to his two teenage sons, Jared and Ethan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard some wonderful stories about this very great man. He was a man who was incredibly generous and who would tip tradies over and above what they ever charged just because. His club president, Gary Fish, had this to say about Mickey. I will read it out:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It was Mickey's 10th year with the club, and for eighth of those he was also a coach of a junior side as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">He did a lot of volunteering around the club – and would never think twice about offering a hand. You'd never have to go looking for him, and he didn't mind getting his hands dirty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As a player Mickey was strong and fit – he once rode a pushbike 200km for charity – so it was a surprise to see this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Everyone loved being around him, and he always had a smile on his face – I'd describe him as a captain's pick, someone you'd always want on your team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The club had a campaign – 'put your boots out for Mickey'. His son Ethan did that, then wore his dad's boots and his Number Eight jersey and scored a goal on Sunday. It was a special moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Mickey' team, the over 45's, a playing on, including at 3pm at James Brown Oval in Woy Woy this Saturday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be joining them. We will be launching a petition in support of seeing defibrillators installed and/or provided to all community clubs on the Central Coast and, indeed, right across New South Wales. Victoria is already leading the way in this important initiative. I am pleased to join Mickey, his club and the community in support of this very, very important initiative. Mickey, I never knew you, but thousands of your fellow committee members did and they loved you. You left a mark on their lives. This week, as I speak in a chamber with a white rose that stands in honour of the member for Canning, in your memory, Mickey, let me also stand alongside your family and your football club in support of this very, very important cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an important cause, because there were five deaths on football fields last year and four this year so far, including Mickey. While it is acknowledged that a defibrillator may not have helped in this particular instance, the facts are—and I know this as a surf lifesaver—that they dramatically increase the chances of survival for a sudden cardiac arrest if are applied quickly. While 30,000 Australians suffer from sudden cardiac arrest, only five per cent survive; but immediate access to this important piece of equipment can lead to a 70 per cent survival rate if applied quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">May I commend Central Coast Football, who are donating $500 to all football clubs on the Central Coast towards a defibrillator, and also the Men of Football on the Central Coast, who are donating $11,500 towards this as well. In honour of Mickey and for Peta, Jared, Ethan and his club, I stand here today to make a commitment to you—in the words of the club's motto—that we will never, ever give up. Vale, Mickey Dean.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  I must comment on the fact that the Federation Chamber is looking fantastic at the moment. Yesterday, a constituent of mine, Georgina Longhurst, called into my office. Georgina had a transplant 12 months ago and reaching this 12-month anniversary is a real milestone after a kidney transplant. She called into my office to let me know that she is supporting a petition protesting the withdrawal of a drug, Sensipar, from the PBS. This is quite an expensive drug—it costs her $400 a month if she has to pay the full amount of money—and it is vital for her to be able to access this drug because without it her life is in jeopardy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The drug helps to control hormones. It decreases levels of the hyperparathyroid hormone—PTH—as well as calcium and phosphorus in the body. It is used to treat hyperparathyroidism, which is an overreaction to the functioning of the parathyroid gland in people who are having long-term dialysis for kidney disease. Georgina had long-term dialysis before her transplant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing this critical drug from the PBS happened recently. I have written to the minister about this as it is something that is vitally important for transplantation recipients. Georgina will not be the only person who has been affected by this. The hormone that is produced by Sensipar is one that really jeopardises her health and the health of tens of thousands of people who have had transplants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue I quickly wanted to raise is one that Georgina raised with my office. The HMRI—the Hunter Medical Research Institute—is having a glow walk on 19 September for the Hunter Transplant Research Foundation. People can register for this at Nobbys surf club. It will take place on Saturday, 19 September. Registration takes place from four o'clock on that day. The first 500 will get a free wristband; T-shirts will be available to purchase on the day. It is a great way for people to get behind and support transplants in the Hunter. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  In August each year the Hervey Bay Seafood Festival attracts about 10,000 people from across Australia. It is the only seafood festival in Australia managed by the men and women who catch it: Australian seafood caught by Australians in Australian waters, processed by Australians, and cooked and served by Australians. You know where it has come from; it is fresh and it is safe. At this year's festival, held just last week, I was joined by Senators Matt Canavan and James McGrath to speak to commercial and recreational fishers. Not only are they concerned about state Labor's proposed net-free fishing zones between Keppel Bay and Fitzroy River, they were anxiously awaiting the results of a review into Commonwealth marine reserves. Prior to our elections in 2013, Senator Canavan and I met with commercial fishers in Hervey Bay who were concerned that the then Labor federal government was planning to lock them out of 1.3 million square kilometres of the Coral Sea. Consultation with the fishing industry was non-existent. Instead, Labor was focused on appeasing the inner-city soy decaf latte-sipping Greens, who have probably never wet a line in their lives, but I bet they have feasted on the spoils of the hard-working fishermen of Queensland. Had Labor been re-elected, their decision would have sent countless family owned businesses broke, cost hundreds of jobs and hurt regional economies. They would have destroyed an industry overnight in much the same fashion as they did with the live cattle trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition committed to set aside and review Labor's management plans for the new Commonwealth marine reserves, and just three months after winning government that is exactly what we did. We are working to restore community confidence. The people in my electorate know better than most how important it is for government to strike a sensible balance that protects the environment, supports a sustainable fishing industry, attracts tourism, and provides cultural, recreational and economic benefits for coastal communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hinkler has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Seafood and tourism are among our biggest employers. We need a management plan which considers the humpback whales that migrate through Hervey Bay each year, the loggerhead turtles that nest at Mon Repos, the families that make a living catching fresh local seafood, the people who eat it as part of a balanced diet and the tourists who visit the region to fish with their mates. What many Greens do not realise is that the commercial fishermen in my electorate want to protect the marine environment just as much as they do. They have spent their lives at sea. It is their home. They rely on its sustainability for their living. They are the great guardians of our oceans and they are the first ones to know when something has gone wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the independent review, five bioregional advisory panels have held over 170 regional public meetings all over the country this year. The review received over 13,000 written submissions and approximately 1,800 responses to the online survey. The feedback has been collated and is being considered by the panel. I look forward to seeing the recommendations to the government. Striking the right balance will require a proposal that is vastly different to Labor's.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  Last month I met with local resident Bret Ramsey, who is the long-term producer and host of a very popular community TV show called <span style="font-style:italic;">In Pit Lane</span>, which is on Melbourne's channel 31. I met with Bret to hear of his concerns about the future of this very important service in Australia—community television.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 10 September 2014 the Minister for Communications announced his proposal to not renew community television operators' apparatus licences beyond 2015. To support this proposal, the minister declared that the currently vacant spectrum would be required to test and trial a new broadcasting compression standard that is more efficient and could have the potential to carry more services. However, the problem with this is that community TV would have to make way for these trials to occur. In his announcement, the minister stated that the best outcome for community TV would be to move the entirety of their services to the internet at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been told by many people that this move to force community TV online would be devastating, especially when community television in Melbourne is watched by over 300,000 people per month and when community television nationally reaches about three million viewers per month in the capital cities in which it broadcasts. After 20 years of providing a valuable training ground in television to thousands of young people across the nation—including many household names such as Hamish and Andy, Waleed Aly and Rove McManus—it is incredibly disappointing for me to know that the Minister for Communications is forcing community TV stations off the air and onto the internet, presuming that you will be able to access the internet, particularly down my way, at the end of 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bret Ramsey has advised that taking <span style="font-style:italic;">In Pit Lane</span> off air would be a massive loss. It would be. Since it debuted on TV in 1996, this incredible program has brought Melbourne television viewers the most diverse international, national and local high-performance motoring and motorsport news ever seen on Australian television. <span style="font-style:italic;">In Pit Lane</span> is screened weekly on Melbourne's Channel 31. It is watched by over 57,000 viewers per week. <span style="font-style:italic;">In Pit Lane</span> is a unique blend of the latest news, interviews and entertainment. It has interviewed people like Mark Webber and Craig Lowndes at the early stages of their careers. It really is something that on a Sunday in particular people will watch, not on the internet but on their televisions. It is a very important program that is basically going to be forced off the air. I think that this is a very retrograde step.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a very proud record of supporting community television. It is grassroots television. We need to continue it, not force it off the air—and not force <span style="font-style:italic;">In Pit Lane</span> off the air—because we need community television to exist in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:39</span>):  The West Coast Eagles football club is a well-known sporting organisation in Western Australia and currently sits second on the AFL ladder. In the week when we paid tribute to our fallen colleague, Don Randall, I would like to mention that the West Coast Eagles were a subject that Don and I often discussed. He enjoyed going to their games and it was one of the highlights of his life. I know that he was really looking forward to the West Coast Eagles participating in the finals this year. Unfortunately, Don will not be around to see that. But, at the same time, I am sure his spirit will be hanging over Subiaco Oval. During those times, I had discussions with Don about the West Coast Eagles relocating to a new $65 million centre at Lathlain in my electorate. I first promoted it way back in 2010 when the new stadium was announced for my electorate, as well, at Burswood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that we need to continue to fight for—and I just need to update the people of my electorate—is getting more funding for the West Coast Eagles. We will continue to do that. The beauty of the West Coast Eagles centre is that it has a lot of community-based facilities. It will have the David Wirrpanda Foundation. We all know about David Wirrpanda and his connection with West Coast, but he also does good work with Aboriginal youth in Western Australia. Also, there will be a community program facility run by the West Coast Eagles. If they move out to Lathlain they will also have a community hub that includes cafes, barbecues, playgrounds and landscaping, as well as a running track. They will also have an aquatic rehabilitation and recovery facility which, under an MoU with the SAS in Western Australia, will help injured soldiers who return from the warfront to recover at this particular facility. They will also have indoor football training facilities, sports science facilities and their administration facilities. The particular highlight, I guess, of the new facility will be two ovals—one the size of the new stadium at Burswood and one the exact same size as the MCG, obviously so that they can use that as a training facility for when they play in the finals. It will be a unique centre. The jewel in the crown is the medical research centre, which will be run as a partnership between Curtin University, UWA and Murdoch University—a partnership which no other facility in Western Australia has had or looks like having.</span>
              </p>

I look forward to continuing to update them. Hopefully, we will be successful in gaining some funding from the state as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:42</span>):  On 20 May 2013, Prime Minister Julia Gillard wrote to then ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher to establish the centre for Quality Teaching and Learning at the University of Canberra. The role of the Centre was to help Australia place in the top five countries globally in reading, maths and science by 2025; to increase teacher effectiveness; and to assist in implementing continuous teacher performance feedback. The contract was signed on 24 July 2013, well before the caretaker period began. It provided for start-up funding of $2 million, plus $4 million per year, making a total payment of $26 million across six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to infrastructure projects, the Abbott government says that it is vital to honour contracts. Indeed, the Prime Minister has criticised the Canberra Liberal opposition for saying they will tear up contracts for ACT light rail. Unfortunately, the Abbott government's love for adhering to contracts does not extend to the contract signed between the Commonwealth of Australia and the University of Canberra on 24 July 2013. After signing the contract, the University of Canberra set about establishing the centre, putting in place management personnel and staff and embarking on the important work of raising teacher quality. In meetings with the University of Canberra after the change of government, the Abbott government gave no sign that it was looking to shut down the centre. It made an initial payment of $1 million. It then refused to nominate a board member or agree to a proposed board chair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 May 2014, nearly a year into the agreement, the government wrote to the University of Canberra, cancelling the contract. It has since refused to pay the university's invoices, totalling $4.4 million to date. The government says it cares about teacher quality and it cares about honouring contracts. Unfortunately, this episode demonstrates that it cares about neither. Moreover, I cannot help wondering whether the University of Canberra is being specifically targeted by Minister Pyne, given that its vice-chancellor has pointed out some of the risks in the government's plans for fee deregulation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on Minister Pyne to stop playing student politics with a great Australian university. If this government really believes in honouring contracts, it should do so in all cases, not merely when it suits its political cause. If the government intends to terminate its contract with the University of Canberra, the least it could do would be to pay them for the invoices that they delivered before cancellation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:45</span>):  Like many in the Limestone Coast community, I was shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Adrian de Bruin AM on Saturday, 16 July. Adrian was a friend and a person I often turned to for wise counsel. He was a man who was respected and listened to by both sides of the political divide, and whose advice was always worth considering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adrian immigrated from Holland to South Australia as a nine-year-old, and his entrepreneurial vision and astute business acumen made him a highly successful businessman. Adrian contributed to the Limestone Coast community by taking risks—investing in building successful businesses from the ground up. He forged his own highly successful career in forestry over many decades, before branching out to focus on a variety of business pursuits including Wagyu beef production. Adrian was amongst the first Australians to recognise the significance of the Wagyu breed and imported 25 full-blood Wagyu to his Mayura Station in the Limestone Coast. Today, the Mayura Wagyu herd numbers 6,000—one of the largest full-blood Wagyu enterprises anywhere in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adrian chose to remain in Mount Gambier, where he has been since arriving in Australia from Holland as a nine-year-old in 1955. Adrian grew his business, South East Afforestation Services, and later Auspine, from one employee in 1978 to hundreds of people over 30 years before the acquisition of Auspine by Gunns. He saw the potential to improve with a focus on driving greater productivity, and his company quadrupled production rates over his tenure. By 2007 the company Adrian headed was regarded as one of the nation's biggest softwood timber companies and, through value-adding and innovation, employed some 1,200 people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The acquisition of Auspine by Gunns allowed him to invest in a series of other businesses, boosting the regional economy. The de Bruin Group, established in 2008, included a series of businesses involving engineering and machining services, property construction and development, aviation maintenance, travel and tourism. Adrian strengthened the wider Limestone Coast economy as well as providing financial security for many local families. His contribution was recognised in this year's Queen's Birthday honours, when he was made a Member of the Order of Australia for significant services to business, particularly to the timber and forestry sector, the beef cattle industry and regional development. His legacy of hard work, prudent risk-taking and commitment to investing his wealth into the community will endure for a very long time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My family and I wish to extend our sympathies to his beautiful wife, Joanne, and his amazing children, Amanda, Joanne, Scott and Alice, as well as to the extended de Bruin family. Adrian will be remembered not only as a giant of the timber industry but, more than that, as one of our nation's great entrepreneurs. In my maiden speech, I said that migrants come to this country not for deliverance but to deliver. Adrian de Bruin delivered.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  There is not a place that I love more in the Fremantle electorate than Native ARC in Bibra Lake, and that is because of what Native ARC represents as an organisation that cares for native animals and does so through community support and volunteer contributions. Having worked and campaigned for better animal welfare throughout my professional life, I find it incredibly uplifting to visit Native ARC and see animals being rescued, cared for and returned to their native habitat. Native ARC and its near neighbour the Cockburn Wetlands Education Centre are places where our community, and particularly our young people, can learn about the importance of local ecosystems not only as habitat for native animals but also as a critical part of the wider environment. For all those reasons, I am honoured to be the patron of Native ARC, and once again I would like to recognise the amazing work of all involved, especially the staff, the board and the incredible band of volunteers and supporters, whose time and energy are essential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was fortunate to take part in the launch of Native ARC's new animal management system, a software program that will greatly reduce the paperwork involved in caring for the more than 2,500 animals admitted to the centre each year. Developed for Native ARC through Volunteering WA's skills-based volunteering program, the animal management system was created by Bankwest staff who volunteered their skills and time for the project. It was fantastic to see the Bankwest's team's eagerness to tour the enclosures and their joy as they took turns holding the band of young joeys, peeking out of their faux pouches. This very useful tool created for Native ARC showed how partnerships which draw on the skills and expertise of people in the corporate world, and not just funding, are key to helping both community groups and the spirit of volunteerism to thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since my first visit back in 2008, Native ARC has continually improved in order to make the biggest possible difference to the wellbeing of our native wildlife. Recent upgrades include air conditioning in the hospital area; a new microscope, which allows for on-site faecal testing; new enclosures; completion of the boundary fence; and the purchase of an industrial washing machine, which helps improve infection control and the capacity to cope with the vast quantity of laundry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Native ARC is obviously going from strength to strength, but its work is now, sadly, threatened by the spectre of Roe Highway Stage 8, sponsored by both the state and federal governments. The proposed six-lane road would tear a massive strip through the middle of the surrounding wetlands and have a negative effect on native animals, directly and in terms of loss of habitat, damage to the ecosystem and loss of connectivity. Roe 8 would impact negatively upon Indigenous heritage, and enjoyment of the local community would be destroyed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have never understood the rationale for this road, because I do not think there is one. The sensible solution involves the proper development of an Outer Harbour in Kwinana, with a supporting road-rail intermodal site that would significantly increase the proportion of freight on rail, keep trucks out of our residential communities to the greatest extent possible and out of our few, precious remnant wetlands altogether.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  I rise to speak about the incredible privilege I have of serving on the boards of four independent public schools. They are East Kenwick Primary School, Gosnells Primary School, Yule Brook College and Sevenoaks Senior College. By being on the board of those schools, I have seen the incredible capacity of teachers in our public schools to deliver not only educational programs and social and pastoral support but guidance to young people, who rely on the teaching profession to enhance their knowledge and skills so that they can become tremendous citizens of this country in the future—not only in the workforce, of course, but in the social fabric of their community and as leaders of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, I was out at Midvale Primary School last week to witness the launch of a strategy by SNAICC. They launched a concept, 'Little people, big futures'. When we think about our children, they are little. And with the guidance of teachers in our public schools they move through their learning stages of life until they reach a point at which they disengage from school. But by being on the boards of all four of my public schools I see incredible compassion, commitment and the use of limited resources to provide the best possible learning environments and programs that build the capability and capacity of young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always remain optimistic about the level of commitment that I see in teachers in schools throughout Australia. There are the little things that they do for an individual, where they see the need to reach out and, in a sense, provide a parenting model. Equally, they provide the level of compassion and guidance that shapes of the life of an individual. I certainly recognise that. I can still see my year 1 primary school teacher, who I referred to in my maiden speech—Miss Abernethy—because she guided me through my first years of formative schooling. I often relate my experience with her to that of the teachers who I engage with across my electorate. Often I become disappointed when I hear criticism of teachers, because they have a challenging task not only in providing the teaching that is required to achieve the outcomes for literacy, numeracy and the subjects in which students are engaged but equally they are in many senses the guiding voice that gives the hopes and aspirations to those who come within their care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to acknowledge the four schools that I am involved with. But, in particular, I want to acknowledge teachers in public education schools whose endeavours and commitments are outstanding.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  On Sunday, 9 August I was pleased to attend Cityhope Church's Day of Honour service in the electorate of Blair. The church is located in Ripley, in Ipswich. The Day of Honour arose from comments made by the former Liberal Deputy Premier Sir Lew Edwards, the former member for Ipswich, to his son, now senior pastor of the church, Mark Edwards, that in 12 years of representing Ipswich in state parliament not once was he thanked by any church for his service to the community. In a moment that is akin to Mahatma Gandhi's comment, 'Be the change you want to see in the world,' Mark decided he would initiate this. This is the 15th year of Cityhope holding this service, a service to, in their words 'encourage, thank, appreciate and honour the tireless commitment and sacrifice of members of the community to the community'. Since it started honouring local, state and federal members in the area, it has rightly extended to the emergency service personnel, including the police, fire, ambulance, SES and rural firefighters, all in orange and various shades of blue uniform. About 100 of them were invited to the stage on Sunday morning.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased and thanked Mark for allowing me the opportunity to address the congregation along with the mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale. Each and every day, these wonderful emergency service personnel make a contribution to the people of Ipswich and its surrounds, often in difficult, dire and dangerous situations. They are always there when we need them. They were there in the floods of 2011 and 2013 and in the 1974 flood when I was a boy. They do not ask for thanks. That said, we do not thank them nearly enough, and that is why Cityhope's Day of Honour service is so special. I said to the congregation there that it is my favourite Sunday of the year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was there along with the mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale; the member for Ipswich, Jennifer Howard; and Jim Madden, the member for Ipswich West. I was touched, along with a lot of other people, to receive framed, handwritten letters of appreciation from children at the service. I met a young girl, Ashley, who actually wrote mine, and I got a photo with her after the service. She had the cutest smile, I can tell you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cityhope said they wanted everyone who attended the day of honour to feel truly honoured, and I can assure you that they did. I congratulate Cityhope's senior pastor, Mark Edwards, for hosting a wonderful and positive welcoming service and for the exceptional contribution the church makes to the Ipswich community. Under Mark's leadership, Cityhope has grown into a vibrant and significant church in the region. Thank you for what you do every day, Cityhope. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  I want to take these few short moments to clarify my position in relation to my own views on same-sex marriage. I can say honestly in this place that I do respect that other people hold a different view to me. Many of them are my closest friends, some are family, but I hold a different view and I seek their tolerance of my view as I tolerate theirs. But that is my personal view. I am the elected member for Braddon, and social media activists would suggest that I should simply take a few polls and cast my vote accordingly. I do not see that as appropriate. I do not believe that my conscience has a higher value than theirs, and I believe that the people's choice should be prevailing, not parliamentarians' choice. I do feel that there are 40 per cent of the population who are quite noisy on this issue: 20 per cent that are actively supporting a yes vote for a change to the definition of marriage and 20 per cent that do not want it. In the middle are, I believe, a very quiet, unassuming 60 per cent that, I believe firmly, need to have the opportunity to have their say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  font-weight:bold;&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;" />It is of concern to me to hear some of the language that is being used by the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other members from the other side, to be quite frank, as they have shifted their focus to personal attacks on the Prime Minister as a man—very unbecoming and nasty name calling, bringing into question, by intimation, his personal values and his faith values. I feel this is very unbecoming. What I say to the people of Braddon is: if you hold the same view as the Prime Minister does, and I would suggest it is at least 50 per cent that do, these comments are directed as much at you as they are at the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I wrap up, I do want to remind the parliament that, in the last parliament, under the leadership of Gillard and Rudd, Stephen Jones, a Labor member, brought in a bill that 26 members of the Labor Party voted against, only two or three years ago. In the Senate there was a motion by the Greens for same-sex marriage that 100 per cent of the Labor Party voted against. They had six years to attend to this matter—and now, suddenly, we are the bigots; we are the homophobes. It is not an acceptable position. I ask the people of Braddon to cast their vote when the time comes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  More than 200 people met at the Broadmeadows Town Hall in my electorate last week. It was a meeting organised by the National Union of Workers to oppose the proposed closure of the Woolworths distribution centre and the subsequent loss of hundreds of local jobs in Broadmeadows in my electorate. Woolworths' decision to leave Broadmeadows will see the potential loss of up to 340 full-time jobs and approximately 400 part-time jobs and casual jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At their proposed new site on the other side of Melbourne, Woolworths will have decreased their full-time roles by about 150 positions. Therefore, if any of the existing employees in my electorate are indeed able to travel to the other side of Melbourne to the new site, and if in fact jobs are on offer, an opportunity for a position will only be available to 190 of the current 340 full-time workers. This suggests that the workload in the new proposed site will be compensated by an increase in casual, contract and hire labour, all of which offer fewer protections for workers. This is a very dangerous and growing reality facing the Australian workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to Woolworths' announcement of their departure from Broadmeadows, the National Union of Workers has launched a campaign to try to save the jobs for our local community. The meeting that I attended last week was organised by the NUW, and its aim was to protect workers' jobs and create new opportunities for workers in Melbourne's northern suburbs. The campaign will centre around a petition, which I have signed. I support their efforts to keep Woolworths jobs in Broadmeadows, and I also support all their efforts to reverse this appalling decision, for my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An important question remains as to why the distribution centre—which is a highly efficient and very productive centre—is being moved from Broadmeadows. No justification, unfortunately, has been given by the Woolworths board. In fact, I think they need to explain the business case that led them to this appalling decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loyalty, dedication and hard work of their workforce is now being repaid by mass sackings—compliments of the very ugly face of Woolworths, the fresh food people. My constituents want to know why they, like the 97 Hutchison Ports workers, were informed by text that they were about to lose their jobs. This is a deeply insensitive means of communicating a life-changing announcement—one that will impact on my constituents' ability to support their families and pay their mortgages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on the Woolworths board to explain what opportunities now exist or will exist for those workers who will become unemployed. Surely it is the very least that they could do for the people who have worked so hard and with such dedication to ensure Woolworths' success and profits. So I condemn the move and I call on Woolworths to change its decision and maintain the distribution centre in Broadmeadows.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  There are four key things that the people who live in the electorate of Mallee really value. They want to be able to drive on a decent road. They want to be able to make a mobile phone call and have good telecommunications services. They want to have education opportunities for their children. And they want to make sure that, when they go to a hospital, they are going to be treated. These are very fundamental parts of our economy and our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really pleased that the federal government has committed significant resources to the Roads to Recovery Program. John Anderson, when he was Deputy Prime Minister, introduced the Roads to Recovery Program, where the federal government gives money direct to local government to build country roads. I am a strong believer that the closer you are to the delivery of the service the more efficient the spend. We, as an administration of federal government, could not even put pink batts in a roof very effectively. It is better that hospitals deliver health. It is better that local councils deliver road services. It has been something that has had bipartisan support for a very long time because the policy works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A little while ago the federal government reintroduced the indexation of fuel and, as part of that reintroduction and the negotiations through the Senate, the decision was made that there would be a top up of Roads to Recovery funding in both the 2015-16 year and the 2016-17 year. In the electorate of Mallee, which has nine large shires—massive geographical areas to cover with roads—that equates to, instead of $10 million a year in Roads to Recovery, nearly $30 million. I want to put on the record here that it is my determination that in the future we should continue that level of funding for our country roads so that in the 2017-18 year, instead of dropping back to $10 million, we continue at that $30 million for our shires and so the triple allocation continues into the 2018-19 year. The indexation of fuel is going to stay, and an investment in country roads is ultimately an investment in the productivity and wealth of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Mallee we produce in a normal year $5.2 billion worth of exports. All of that starts at the farm gate but has to drive down a dirt road before it gets onto the state roads and before it gets onto the national highways. It is my strong determination to fight for better country roads, and I hope that, in the spirit of bipartisanship, both sides of parliament will see the ongoing use of Roads to Recovery and continue to fund that for more into the forward estimates.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="8K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FITZGIBBON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  The incidence of ice addiction in our communities is frightening. While ice addiction may not have passed alcohol problems in number, it appears the drug causes in people responses we have not seen before. The proliferation of ice will not be arrested through public meetings. More often than not, those turning to drugs are facing some form of depression, abuse or marginalisation. A response to the ice scourge must be greater resources—that is, more money for our police and more money for those who support those with mental health problems or those with addictions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, there is no better response to marginalisation than to put a person in a job. Sadly, Australia now has an unemployment rate higher than that experienced during the global financial crisis, and that is particularly true in my own region, the Hunter Valley. Not only has the Abbott government allowed the jobless rate to rise; it has been cutting funding to the many not-for-profit organisations that offer support and counselling to those with problems. The Prime Minister's strategy must change. If it does not change, the epidemic will grow worse and the unemployment rate will grow worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a happier note, I want to acknowledge three high achievers in the Hunter electorate. Kurri Kurri's Dolly Marriott celebrated her 100th birthday in Cessnock's Mountain View Lodge on Tuesday. It is a great achievement, and we wish her the very best in achieving her stated goal of reaching 105. Nineteen-year-old Jordan Fallon became the youngest Rotary Club president in Australia when he was recently inducted to be the leader of the Kurri Kurri club. It is a big achievement for a young man already achieving on many other fronts. Kurri Kurri High School's Ryan Porter has been given a vocational education and training award in recognition of his outstanding achievement in his electrotechnology course at Cessnock TAFE. I wish him all the very best in his future career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jordan and Ryan are reminders of how dangerous and wrong it is to stereotype our youth. Some face challenges, yes, but it has always been thus. Some run off the rails, yes, but it has always been the case. But many more—indeed, the overwhelming majority—are doing things that we could not have imagined when we were their age. We should encourage them while offering a hand up to those who need and deserve it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I have spoken on numerous occasions in this place to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of volunteers in the Dobell community. As I have mentioned before, the noblest aspect of a volunteer's work is their dedication and commitment to a safer, healthier and stronger community. Volunteers do not set about their day for personal gain. They do it to genuinely improve another person's quality of life and, in many cases, to save lives. Each year in Dobell, over 16,000 men and women give their time through volunteering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great joys of being a member of parliament is the opportunity to meet and support these volunteers and the organisations to which they belong. Recently, I was grateful for the opportunity to catch up with volunteers from the Central Coast Volunteer Rescue Association as they celebrated 40 years of service to the Central Coast community. Many people assume that the VRA is part of the New South Wales police or the SES when, in fact, the VRA is a stand-alone rescue association manned by volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales Volunteer Rescue Association was formed in 1969 and has approximately 3,700 members. Last year, volunteers attended 10,803 incidents involving 104,612 operational hours, assisted 5,219 persons, rescued 3,199 persons and, sadly, removed 58 deceased persons. Over and above this, volunteers spent 119,302 hours engaged in other activities including training, meetings, regional exercises, equipment maintenance and fundraising. In total, these amazing men and women gave approximately $5.5 million, in monetary terms, of their own time to assist others. The VRA played a prominent role in the recovery efforts at the Granville train disaster and, more recently, on the Central Coast in the aftermath of the April storms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Central Coast VRA was formed in 1975 in response to the growing need for the Central Coast to have its own rescue unit. Tragically, during the mid-1970s, before the M1 was established, the Central Coast portion of the Pacific Highway was one of the deadliest stretches of road in New South Wales and without a local specialised rescue unit. Today, Central Coast rescue is a volunteer organisation supported by local businesses and community members. As with all New South Wales volunteer rescue associations, the Central Coast VRA provides support to the population of the Central Coast 24 hours a day, seven days a week, helping anyone, anywhere, anytime. Based at Wyong, the unit has two vehicles operated by a squad of 40 volunteers. During the storms, these 40 volunteers were out there every day helping as many people as they could, and I commend them for the work that they did. So, the next time you see your VRA at your local shopping centre raising money, please be assured that the money is going to a good cause to help and save others, and please give generously.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  This Sunday morning, at 10 am, we will have our annual Welcoming the Babies ceremony. It is a terrific day with plenty of entertainment and plenty of community groups coming along to talk to local families. So I invite all the young families in the area to come down to the ceremony. We will have Peebo and Dagwood there to provide the entertainment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, two Sundays ago, on what was a really spectacular winter's day in Sandgate, we had our Einbunpin Festival. The festival was a celebration by and for the community about everything that makes Sandgate so special. It is really one of those exceptional events that makes the north side of Brisbane one of the best places to live in Australia. After 24 years, the festival is as strong as ever. It is a wonderful opportunity for local schools, artists and community groups to showcase their talents and, of course, especially their cooking skills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make particular mention of a couple of strong community groups—first of all, SANDBAG. Since the launch of the Einbunpin Festival in 1992, SANDBAG has hosted the event, and its continuing support makes it a great success. The second is the Sandgate Men's Shed, who have done an amazing job turning the wood from the old Shorncliffe Pier into pens and clocks. For any history buff or someone who simply wants a piece of north-side history to call their own, purchasing one of these is certainly a good thing to do. Congratulations to the Einbunpin committee chairperson, Victoria Newton, Secretary Anika Vines, Avalon MacKellar, who organised the stalls, Beth Wild, who organised the entertainment, Jen Henderson and the rest of the committee for coordinating this year's event. Particular congratulations should go to the chairperson, Councillor Victoria Newton, whose stewardship over the past 15 years has made the festival what it is today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to mention that Councillor Newton announced her immediate retirement as Councillor of the Deagon Ward earlier this week. Over the past 15½ years, she has been an extraordinary advocate for the community and a very good personal friend. We certainly wish her well for the future. I would like to extend my congratulations to her replacement, Jared Cassidy. He has big shoes to fill, but I am sure he is more than capable of doing that and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also with great sadness that I inform the House that the Australian Labor Party lost another titan of the movement over the winter break, Kev O'Leary. Kev was 100 years of age and had been a member of the Australian Labor Party continuously for 85 years—the longest serving member in our party's history—a truly remarkable feat. To me Kev was a mentor, an inspiration and, above all, a mate. I liked nothing more than having a few beers with Kev and his mate Les at the Aspley Leagues Club, watching the footy. Of course, he could still drink pretty well, even at 100.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has endured over the years because there have been tens of thousands like Kev who have been active and doing what they do not because of what the party could do for them but because of what they could do for the party. His contribution to our party and our nation cannot be underestimated. Kev's spirit will always live on and will always remain as an inspiration to a new generation dedicated to making Australia a better place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  Madam Deputy Speaker Landry, you would know better than most that the Royal Flying Doctor Service is the lifeline of our communities. They provide the vital emergency help we need when things go wrong out in the regions. But, if you are unlucky enough to need the RFDS near Norseman, their job becomes a whole lot harder. Norseman is the major town in the Shire of Dundas, situated 726 kilometres from Perth. It is the eastern gateway to WA and is a major stopping point for travellers to and from the eastern states. The nearest city is Kalgoorlie-Boulder, a two-hour drive away, and there is frequent travel between Kalgoorlie and Esperance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Norseman has an airstrip that lies on Lake Cowan and, in its current condition, after only a few millimetres of rain the runways are rendered unfit for landing and take-off. This means that, if there is a requirement for aero-medical services, planes cannot land. Access to the RFDS is critical not only for Norseman residents but also for mining and industrial accidents and severe road trauma that occurs across the Nullarbor and between Kalgoorlie and Esperance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accidents are not uncommon in the regions, with more than 56 per cent of fatalities occurring in regional WA despite just 22 per cent of the population living there. Single vehicle run-off is the dominant crash type across the state, at 54 per cent, and even higher in the regions, at 64 per cent. According to an RAC analysis, there were 16 fatalities in the Goldfields-Esperance region in 2014. This is nearly four times the state fatality rate and 6.5 times the metropolitan rate. According to Main Roads data, there were 120 crashes on the Coolgardie-Esperance Highway from 2010 to 2014, and five of these were fatal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get this issue fixed as quickly as we can. But, as with all infrastructure projects, it is a funding issue. The Shire of Dundas have come to the party by committing to the project. They recently moved a motion in a council meeting to raise a $1.5 million loan to accompany any government funding secured. But they need another $1.5 million to complete the all-weather airstrip, and that is where I come in. I am working with the Dundas shire to make sure they apply for funding through the right channels. I have spoken to the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development to make sure he knows how important this issue is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why today I am launching the Norseman airstrip social media campaign. If we can demonstrate that people care about this issue and feel strongly enough about it, that gives us a better chance of getting the funding. I have started a petition in support of the upgrade of the Norseman airstrip and you can find it on my website: www.rickwilson.com.au.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make sure that Canberra understands how important this issue is to our community, so I urge all Goldfields residents to support our campaign to upgrade the airstrip. You never know when you or a family member, a friend or even a complete stranger might need the RFDS to come to help near Norseman. It could literally be a matter of life and death. Together we can fight for this vital infrastructure project for our local community.</span>

Sadly, she passed away on Thursday, 30 July this year. Paula was a young woman dedicated to helping others. Whether through local schools, church groups or community organisations or indeed through her political involvement, Paula was always and constantly advocating for those less fortunate—for abused children, victims of domestic violence and families living with disabilities. She mounted a campaign to prevent the closure of a community based library so it could continue to provide educational programs and assistance to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You could always count on Paula to take a stand. She was a woman of high principles, a very religious woman devoted to her church, serving on the council of the Good Shepherd Catholic parish in Hoxton Park. But Paula was also the vice-president of the Hinchinbrook branch of the Labor Party. Paula always made her presence felt. She was a tireless campaigner for the Labor Party. During elections she would work day and night to support the Labor team. Day after day she would volunteer in the party's office, working in the phone bank. Paula was the first volunteer to make 1,000 calls to residents on behalf of the campaign, and she went on to make many thousands more. The member for Greenway and I were just two of the MPs who benefited from Paula's dedication, commitment and unshakable belief in the Labor cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

This reward is reserved for those in the Labor Party who have made a long and distinguished contribution. We were then, and remain now, very proud of our friend. Paula was an extremely dedicated teacher, as well as being a passionate advocate for women and children in need. She took it upon herself only last year to organise and host a domestic violence forum in Liverpool, involving police, local community leaders and a cross-section of our community. Paula was a remarkable young woman. She will be sorely missed by everybody who knew her. I offer my sincere condolences to Paula's family, particularly her mother, Patricia. May she rest in peace.</span>

I know that many of us have had dreams of having a crack at sport at a higher level, but it is often difficult for families to meet the significant financial costs and demands that it entails. I am really pleased to say that, through the government's Local Sporting Champions program, we are enabling young 'coasties' aged 12 to 18 to kick-start their dreams. These grants deliver assistance towards the cost of things like travel, accommodation, uniforms and equipment, whether they are competing, coaching or officiating at an official state, national or even international sporting event. It really helps people travelling more than 125 kilometres, as well, with grants up to $500.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a number of worthy recipients. But in this round there are a number of people from my electorate. We should remember these names, because I dare say they could be people you will see in green and gold in years to come. Among them are three basketball stars: Matthew Kenyon, from Avoca Beach, who has had the opportunity to compete in the under-18 national basketball championships, in Ballarat; Terrigal's Charlie Evans; and Luke Cassidy, from the great Gosford City Rebels, who had a similar opportunity in the under-16 national championships, in Tasmania. Thirteen-year-old Hannah Murray recently competed, as the only girl in her team, at the Australian Little League Championships for baseball, while Jacob Curcio, from East Gosford, received a grant to represent his state in hockey. He has a dream to one day play for the Kookaburras. Mackenzie Penn, from Avoca Beach, represented the Coast in China last month. She will receive a grant for her outstanding efforts in track and field. In November, 12-year-old Ashton Hurley, from Terrigal, will fly to Adelaide for the Pacific School Games football tournament. Ashton is a striker—and, who knows, maybe he will be hitting the back of the net for our Central Coast Mariners in seasons to come.</span>

Jemma Smith achieved nomination to represent Umina Surf Life Saving Club at the Pool Rescue Championships in Queensland. She trains 12 sessions a week. She is a passionate local who deserves this support—support which could one day save a life on one of our Central Coast beaches. Kincumber residents can rightly be proud of Justin Lenkovic after his recent achievements at the National Karate Championships in Adelaide. His grant will help him get a new tracksuit and uniform. Sam Hutchinson, from Avoca, will receive a grant to help with costs after the junior Canoe Sprint World Championships. Finally, we have the brothers Thomas and Paulo Baingan-Cruise, who are boxers from Umina Beach. Next week, they will have the opportunity to go toe-to-toe at the national Golden Gloves event in Queensland. These are fantastic achievements from young sporties on the Central Coast. We are proud of them all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Following on from the member for Fowler's comments, I want to record my deep sympathy to the family of Paula Keyes. Paula was an outstanding individual. An educator, she was someone who was passionate about education. She held multiple degrees and was held in very high esteem for the assistance she provided to children and adults alike in their learning. I was honoured to give one of the speeches at her funeral last week, which was a very fitting send-off for someone who left us far too early.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that vein, I want to mention some of the outstanding schools in my electorate, which I had the pleasure to visit during the recess. In late July we had Education Week in New South Wales, the theme of which was 'Celebrating local heroes'. I thought that was particularly apt for our local school communities in Greenway. I had the privilege of attending a number of events. Vardy's Road Public School, a great local school, held an assembly, which is always a delight. There was a family there who live in the street that I grew up in. Their children were attending a private school in the local area and they decided to move their children into the public system. They moved them to Vardy's Road Public School. I was surprised to see them there, but they said they could not be happier with the quality of education that their children were receiving at Vardy's Road, which was a great testament to that school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Toongabbie Public School I had the privilege of handing over a plaque and a shrub for their Anzac Centenary Garden, courtesy of Blacktown RSL and the Centenary of Anzac grant process in Greenway. There is amazing teacher-parent engagement going on at Toongabbie. We had a film of a class showing new methods of teaching to parents who were in attendance on this particular morning that I was there. It was an absolute tribute to that school. The assembly was also really interesting. I asked some of the children if they wanted to name who their local heroes were and just about every child put up their hand and named their individual class teachers, which I think was just lovely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a pleasure to visit Caddies Creek Public School in my electorate of Greenway and also the William Rose School, excellence in sensory and special education. They had their fun run, and I want to commend Blacktown Local Area Command for the care and dedication they took in participating. Lastly, just outside my electorate is the Chifley College Shalvey Campus. It hosted a special guest speaker, Michael Chaaya, who is the most inspirational person I know. He also happens to be my husband! He is a graduate of Shalvey high school. He has gone from student to partner at law, and he continues to inspire to this day.</span>

Last Tuesday was the official launch of jobactive at MAX Employment at Beenleigh, and I would like to thank Minister Luke Hartsuyker for coming to our region for the event. It was a great opportunity to show off the hard-working people and community organisations in Forde who are achieving tremendous things when it comes to assisting our most vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Forde electorate is a unique part of South-East Queensland. Our region has some of the most passionate people I have met—people who are volunteers, people who are part of hard-working community organisations and people who are savvy and innovative business leaders. We live in a community where people are proud to put up their hands and offer help to those who need it most. Like many parts of Australia, Forde has its challenges when it comes to creating opportunities and reducing the number of people relying on government assistance. Each and every day we are kicking goals when it comes to improving services and creating opportunities for businesses to thrive, grow and prosper and, through that, add new staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, welcoming the jobactive service to help more of our job seekers find and keep jobs was another goal in helping to improve the opportunities for job seekers and break that cycle of long-term unemployment. One of the ways this is being achieved is through our government's $1.2 billion wage subsidy pool, offering employers incentives to hire and train new staff. The rollout for Work for the Dole in Forde has also been a great achievement for our region. Forde was one of the national trial sites for Work for the Dole, and it was incredibly effective courtesy of the support of the many community organisations in our area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program will not only see job seekers gain new skills while looking for work but community organisations will also benefit from the help provided, with participants working on projects that will benefit the broader community. It was great to meet with the hardworking team at MAX Employment, which is one of several organisations in Forde rolling out the new jobactive system. While providing a quality service that will improve the employment prospects of our residents is a big part of jobactive, it is also important that we encourage our residents to seek out and utilise those services to the best of their abilities. We need to be actively engaging with these people to provide them with the confidence they need not only to ask for help but to know they will receive the help they need. I look forward to working with the new jobactive providers in our region to help connect job seekers and employers. Our government is 100 per cent committed to helping job seekers find employment, and I would like to thank everyone involved for making jobactive a reality.</span>

                    </a>  for over 20 years, and knows how difficult this can be. I think every MP and senator has had someone arrive in their office—a mum or a dad—who has told that story of the problems that come with child support when it goes wrong. The terms of reference for this inquiry were to look at a number of aspects of the child support system, including assessing the methodology for calculating payments and the adequacy of current compliance and enforcement powers for the management of child support payments, the effectiveness of mediation and counselling arrangements as part of family assistance frameworks, and ensuring that children in high-conflict families are best provided for under the child support scheme—because when all is said and done this is the focus of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-bottom:4pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee made 25 recommendations in the report, some quite adventurous, and I commend the committee for that. These are very sensible recommendations that will bring the child support system in line with approaches used in other streams of family support services. Several of the recommendations refer to the 'best interests of the child', which, as every family law practitioner would know, underpins part VII of the Family Law Act, governing parenting arrangements. Some of the recommendations also reflect the best practice approach when family violence is present, for example in those situations where mediation is not appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-bottom:4pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Child Support Program has been operating for over 25 years. During that time, more than $45 billion in payments has been transferred from one parent to another—hopefully, always to the benefit of children. The system is designed to assist parents continuing to support their children after a relationship breakdown by providing administrative support, advice and financial adjudication. I do, of course, acknowledge the fact that many parents who separate and divorce and go through that process do not have to involve the child support system at all. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-bottom:4pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 25 years that the child support system has been in existence there have been many changes in the structure of the average family. For instance, 25 years ago the number of women in the workforce was significantly lower. Twenty-five years ago we knew far less about the impact of family violence on children. Many of those stories were not told. So it is sensible to revisit these systems that have been in place for many decades. It is sensible to apply knowledge that was not available when the systems were set up and to update those systems accordingly. That is what this report has recommended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-bottom:4pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the recommendations address the modern scourge of domestic violence. In particular, the committee recommends that a dedicated family violence response unit within the Department of Human Services be established. This unit would be responsible for ensuring that the safety and wellbeing of the child are paramount. These are important recommendations, and I am sure that the Attorney-General will take notice. Children should not be put in danger by parents arguing about who is paying for their care. Children should not be forced to live in poverty with a parent too afraid to ask for child support from an abusive ex-partner. The system needs to address these problems. These recommendations will go some way to doing just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-bottom:4pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this year, with Rosie Batty as our Australian of the Year, there is no issue more in the public spotlight than domestic violence—and so it should be. It is shameful that so far this year more than one woman a week has been murdered by a partner or former partner. These recommendations reflect the gravity of the domestic violence epidemic, and while they are obviously no answer, or no magic answer, to the problem, I hope they will offer some protection to these vulnerable families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-bottom:4pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that long-standing institutions are revisited with a view to addressing problems that have developed over time, in particular with a view to protecting the vulnerable. Child support, although a separate system entirely, goes hand in hand with the family law system in Australia. Both systems assist, in different ways, families that have separated or are separating. Our current family law system has been in existence for 40 years, with some amendments along the way. By and large, it is a system that supports families well. It does have its problems, however, not least of which is that it is underresourced. Practitioners that I have spoken to all over Australia say that there are lengthy delays both in getting before a judge to have a matter heard and then getting the final judgement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-bottom:4pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that the judges are working as hard as they can to get through the incredibly long list of matters they have to deal with. Obviously, more judges would help; obviously, replacing those judges that have already retired and those about to retire would help too. Remember, when a judge is appointed we know when they will definitely retire, ill-health aside. It is amazing that someone like Justice Bell—we knew 40 years ago when he was going to retire, and he still has not been replaced! Maybe it is time to have a fresh look at the family law system and see if improvements can also be made to that system. Delays are not good for families in distress. High-conflict families would be much better served having their matters dealt with in a timely manner so that stress triggers can be reduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is particularly important for children in those families that there are not delays, that children can be cared for by parents not continually in conflict. We sometimes just need to say: 'How can we do this better? What will reduce the stress for these families? What will reduce the delays in resolving family disputes? How can these disputes be dealt with in a more timely way? Most importantly, how can we protect the vulnerable children of these high-conflict families?' I do not have all of the answers, but these are issues the government and the parliament need to consider. I am proud that, with respect to the child support system, the committee has answered the question: how can we do this better? These recommendations, if implemented by the government, will reduce stress for families after separation, will see child support disputes dealt with in a more timely way and will protect the children of high-conflict families. I commend the report to the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I speak in relation to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Alcohol, hurting people and harming communities</span> report inquiring into the harmful use of alcohol in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. This report was handed down in June 2015. I congratulate the member for Murray, the chair of the committee, and the member for Lingiari, the deputy chair, and note that this was a bipartisan report with very strong recommendations. It is one of the best reports I have seen in my three terms in federal parliament. It contains a way forward to deal with the challenge of excessive consumption of alcohol in Indigenous communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that sly grogging, humbugging and other challenges exist in Indigenous communities, but excessive use of alcohol remains a big challenge. This is a serious report, and it contains a number of important recommendations. One relates to recommendation 7 of the report, which deals with alcohol management plans. These are community agreements to tackle harm caused by alcohol abuse. They are developed in partnership with communities, with the support of local organisations and governments. They have proved to be successful, but there has been a lack of responsiveness by the government in relation to alcohol management plans. We know, according to conclusion 3.105 of the report, that the committee heard that alcohol management plans had been sitting on the minister's desk 'for years', with the goodwill and momentum of the community slowly dissipating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this report there has been no response from the government, but we do know that there have been answers to questions on notice. On 10 July 2015 the minister gave an answer to a question on notice that deals with these alcohol management plans—the very subject of this report. It said that the last alcohol management plan the minister actually approved was on 26 May 2014, in relation to the Titjikala community, in the Northern Territory. It said there are no alcohol management plans with the minister for consideration. Why? The report actually recommends, in recommendation 7, that the backlog of alcohol management plans be cleared by the minister by January 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen in the last couple of days in relation to these alcohol management plans, the very subject of this report? The minister initiated this inquiry of the House of Representatives Indigenous Affairs Committee into dealing with the serious issues of alcohol management in the Northern Territory and alcohol abuse in Indigenous communities, yet over the weekend we heard the minister allege that in some remote communities—some of which we attended for the proposes of this report—they were using Vegemite to brew bathtubs full of moonshine, calling the popular spread a 'precursor to misery'. The minister went as far as to say that vegemite is an increasingly common factor in domestic violence cases, and that children were failing to turn up to school because they were too hung-over. Where was the evidence he gave to this inquiry, to this report? That was not given in this report. He called for the sale of Vegemite to be restricted in 'dry' remote Indigenous communities. Then, and since, he has not referred to one remote community—some of which we attended for this the purposes of this report—to identify where this was happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shortly after, the Prime Minister came out to reassure Australians that there would be no 'Vegemite watch' in Australia, 'because Vegemite, quite properly, is for most people a reasonably nutritious spread on your morning toast or on your sandwiches'. So this very serious issue, the purpose of this inquiry that the minister initiated, has turned into a ridiculous sideshow that has served to peddle negative stereotypes of Aboriginal people. The Abbott government is bickering about whether to police Vegemite, rather than addressing the serious issue of alcohol abuse and responding to this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this sideshow—it is a sideshow because we have a report with many recommendations here—enters its fifth day, I call on the minister to explain why, in the more than 700 days since the Abbott government came to office, he has implemented just one of the 23 community alcohol management plans, which we recommended he approve in order to get rid of the backlog by January 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that on 10 July 2015 the answers to questions on notice came back. Why didn't the minister give this information to the inquiry? Why did the minister hold back this information? He then says he is going to refer it to the Northern Territory for some practical actions. I will tell you what the Northern Territory did for us during the course of this inquiry. There was a complete lack of cooperation from the CLP government, led by Adam Giles, in the Northern Territory. We say in the report, at paragraph 3.103:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee notes with concern the lack of cooperation from the Northern Territory government to this inquiry. The committee was prevented from obtaining any direct evidence from hospital staff and police in the Northern Territory on their experience of alcohol-related harm. Although the Northern Territory Government provided an aggregated submission, this did not address many of the concerns of those dealing with alcohol-related harm on a daily basis in the territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Northern Territory government did when they came to power was to get rid of the banned drinkers register, which we found, during the course of this inquiry, had been successful. The evidence in the report shows that the then Northern Territory Labor government's response to the banned drinkers register was that it was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… working effectively to reduce the supply of alcohol to problem drinkers, and that its abolition was associated with increases in alcohol-related harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what we found. That is what the report says. Minister Scullion thinks the Northern Territory government is going to take practical actions, because he is going to get rid of the AMPs and hand the issue off to the Northern Territory so they can deal with it themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we found no cooperation from the Northern Territory government. They got rid of the banned drinkers register. We recommended in this inquiry, in recommendation 8, that the Northern Territory government reintroduce the banned drinkers register and set up a comprehensive data collection and evaluation program that monitors criminal justice, hospital and health data. The Northern Territory government has done nothing about that—no response to that recommendation in the report. Instead, the Northern Territory government criminalised public drunkenness. They brought in this alcohol mandatory treatment scheme, which effectively puts people in the criminal justice system who should not be there. Criminalising alcohol consumption, in the view of the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, is a failed strategy. The evidence during the course of the inquiry revealed that it is a failed strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These people in the NT government are the people Minister Scullion, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, thinks can cope with this stuff. We recommended getting rid of alcohol mandatory treatment and bringing back a voluntary scheme—and properly resourcing it. Minister Scullion needs to have a look at this, because his colleagues and comrades in the Northern Territory do not know what they are doing. Where are the alcohol management plans, Minister Scullion? He has approved just one of 23. Where are the other 22 from the community?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bring back the banned drinkers register in the Northern Territory. Get rid of the alcohol mandatory treatment programs, with punitive measures that punish and criminalise people when this should be thought of as a health issue. The Abbott government should stop shirking its responsibility in this area. That is what this report says. It is a disgrace. The minister has a vegemite watch on this thing; he is pursuing 'vegemite gate'. He should not be doing this whatsoever. There is no transparency, no accountability and no preventive community-driven measures about this issue in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory government did not cooperate one little bit with the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CLP government has failed monumentally in the Northern Territory, because we know excessive alcohol consumption results in abuse, neglect and family violence for women and children. This same CLP government, in league with this minister in the Abbott government, is failing the people in the Northern Territory and failing the people of Australia. I urge the government—I implore the government, I exhort the government—to look at the recommendations in this bipartisan report, led by the member for Murray and the member for Lingiari, and follow the recommendations. They provide a pathway forward. Stop shirking your responsibility and do your job, Minister Scullion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In my eight years in this place, that was the most political, shrill and shallow speech I have ever heard—a disgusting effort. I actually had trouble containing my anger while listening to the member for Blair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great tradition in this place of putting together reports that are bipartisan, that take a great deal of the effort and the resources of the House—of the members of all parties involved in putting this report together. And this is a good report. The member for Blair acknowledged that in the first 10 seconds of his speech and then went on some shallow rant of a political nature. I ask you: do you think the communities in Cape York and northern Australia and in the western part of my electorate who are battling with the effects of alcohol in their communities would be impressed by a political speech like the one we just heard?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an attempt to bring a bit of bipartisanship and sense to this, I will continue on to the report. Minister Scullion, I have to say, is a great friend of the Aboriginal people of Australia. He has a great affinity with them and he lives his life through the way he speaks. The member for Blair may have peaked in his political climb to the top if that is all he can come up with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alcohol and drugs are a scourge in Aboriginal Australia, remote Australia and more urban areas such as the area I represent. This is not something that has just become apparent in the last couple of years or the last decade. This is an issue that has been a scourge for our First Australians for a long time. This report highlights and reinforces a lot of issues that we are aware of, but this report has formally put them together in order. I believe this report can be a road map towards addressing many of these problems. I am a relative newcomer to this committee. I replaced the member for Capricornia late last year. I was not present for many of the hearings and evidence, but I was present at three or four of those hearings. In South Australia, we went to Coober Pedy, Ceduna and Adelaide. I was very impressed with the will of the communities in those towns, particularly in Ceduna where we met with Mayor Allan Suter from the District Council of Ceduna, Mrs Miller from the Ceduna Koonibba Aboriginal Health Service and other members of the Miller family, who are very strong community leaders in the town of Ceduna. They have some real issues with being accessible to some of the remote communities in South Australia where there are alcohol bans. People come to Ceduna basically to drink. Those people live rough. We saw them sleeping in the grass. In Australia in 2015, it is indeed a great blight on our society. In Ceduna they have a room for sobering up and it is filled to capacity nearly every night. The community of Ceduna have made a decision. They agreed last week that they will be part of a trial—one of two or three communities around Australia—to try the welfare card. I really wish them well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought that the town of Moree in my electorate would be an ideal location to trial the welfare card. The population of Aboriginal people in Moree stands at about 22 per cent and the welfare recipients are about 50-50, Indigenous to non-Indigenous. We had some very positive discussions with community leaders, but unfortunately the community leadership did not, in the end, embrace the concept. Sadly, some of the influences that were placed on that came from the hoteliers, where their cash flow is reliant on people on welfare, with takeaway sales and poker machines. It is basically my home town and I am terribly saddened that it is not going ahead. I said to the people of Moree that this was not going to be imposed; I thought it would be an opportunity to try to address some of the issues that are no worse in Moree than anywhere else. I thought they might be prepared to have a go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the things that we heard during our hearings just show that this is a very complex issue, and that is why the member for Blair's contribution was so irritating. We heard from health workers working in the communities of Cape York, where alcohol bans have been in place. An illicit bottle of Scotch is $200 or $300 in some of those communities. A hit of ice is $15. This is not just a matter of banning grog or having registers with drinkers on it; it is probably a combination of all these things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe this report is a good one. A lot of soul-searching and a lot of thought went into this report and I certainly hope that it will be used as it was intended: as a tool whereby we can continue to address the blight of alcohol and the long-term effects of foetal alcohol syndrome—it not only has short-term effects; it is intergenerational. Quite frankly, after hearing some of the evidence on this, I would say to all mothers and fathers who are intending to conceive and have children: for God's sake, do not drink. This is not an issue just for remote Aboriginal communities; this is a blight on the entire Australian community. The alcohol culture that we have in this country is not only affecting the health of Australians now; it is actually impacting on the potential of our offspring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some very sobering recommendations in this report. I commend the report to the House. I remind House that this report was put together in the spirit of bipartisanship—the one element that I am so proud that we have in this House. I tell my constituents that this place, basically, is a place of cooperation, where people of goodwill do their best for the people of Australia. Let us not see another episode like we have just seen from the member for Blair, which put a blight on the system that we have.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  This was a very informative inquiry and the report highlights some very important issues in relation to hepatitis C. Hep C is one of those silent conditions that people do not know whether a person is suffering from and living with. It is a disease that has a lot of stigma attached to it, and that stigma really impacts on so many different aspects of treatment and the lives of people living with hep C. The terms of reference for the inquiry including examining the prevalence of the disease and the testing and treatment options available through primary care, acute care, Aboriginal medical services and prisons—and I will spend a fair amount of my contribution to this debate talking about prisons. The inquiry looked at the cost of treatment of the short-term and long-term impacts of hep C, and methods to improve prevention. Public health awareness and prevention and non-government organisations were also addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of recommendations that were made in relation to this inquiry. Of course, as with all recommendations of the health committee, they were unanimous. This was a report and an issue that everybody embraced and, at the end of the day, we came up with 10 very strong and good recommendations. They covered things like the overview of hep C in Australia, living with hep C, testing and treatment, and reaching populations at high risk. This was one of the areas that the committee really homed in—looking at people coming from migrant backgrounds, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations and, of course, corrections centres and how you handle hep C and prevent the spread of hep C within the prison population. Recommendation 10 is that the Australian government raise the issue of hep C in prisons and establish a national standard in prison health delivery as part of the COAG and health council processes. I think that is a recommendation that is of vital importance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to people in custodial settings, Professor Michael Levy AM, Clinical Director of Justice Health Services ACT, describes the prison environment as a perfect storm for hep C because of a number of factors. There is a concentration of hep C individuals within those institutions. There is fighting. There is barbering, tattooing and body piercing. There is boredom and, of course, illicit drugs are available in those jails.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An issue that I found particularly troubling is that, when people serve a custodial sentence and are put into a jail, the testing of that individual and the knowledge of whether a person has hep C is very ad hoc. They are asked, 'Do you have hep C?' If a person identifies as having hep C then they are taken into a little group and given a little bit of counselling and some special treatments. To my way of thinking, that is not good enough, because you have a population within a very confined area where a number of people have hep C. In the report it was noted that there is no national surveillance system for hep C infection in prison facilities, and I find that very troubling because, once a person has served their custodial sentence, they go out into the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a study of 114 prisoners with a history of injecting drugs who tested negative to hep C at the start of their sentence; that was upon entering the prison. Thirteen of those prisoners subsequently tested positive. During the time that they were in prison, they contracted hep C. To my way of thinking, that is not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty-three per cent of prisoners continue to use injecting drugs whilst incarcerated, 90 per cent of whom are sharing injecting equipment. That is really unsafe behaviour. I do not think our present system is addressing it properly. I think we need to get more data. There is a lack of data and a lack of any consistent data around this. There is a lack of national surveillance data. I mentioned the small sample of 114 with the 13, but that is unique. That does not happen all the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember what I said a moment ago: people are asked when they enter a jail whether or not they have hep C and it is left to that. As the member for Calwell said, 'How would they know?' Well, a lot of people do not know, and if they do they do not feel inclined to disclose the fact that they have hep C.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that Australian prisoners who are injecting are at least eight times more likely to contract hep C while they are in prison than non-injecting prisoners—eight times more likely! The Kirby Institute reported that 31 per cent of prison entrants were hep C antibody positive, and this represented an increase of 22 per cent since 2010. So it is increasing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A very significant proportion of the population in jails have hep C, and I do not think the system is actually working properly to keep and follow the data. Then, when a person is released from prison, I do not think that the proper plans and processes are put in place so that they do not subsequently infect other people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of strategies that were talked about. The most controversial is the needle exchange program within prisons. I can understand why that is quite controversial for prison officers: (a) they feel at risk, because prisoners would have needles; and (b) as prison officers, they are supposed to make sure that illegal behaviour does not take place, and injecting illegal drugs is an illegal behaviour. There are only 60 prisons around the world that use needle exchange programs. In Spain, there was a decrease from 40 per cent to 26 per cent of prevalence in jails because of that program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are other ways, too. The Prison Officers Association talked about education, and about making sure that tattooing could be made available within jails because data indicated that 39 per cent of men and 20 per cent of women in prison get tattoos and 14 per cent of women reportedly have piercing done whilst they are in prison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really complex situation. It is a very good report that I would recommend to everybody. It is an issue that is of great importance. It is an issue not only about prison populations; it is about people in the community, it is about containing the spread of the hep C infection and it is also about putting in place proper education so that the spread of hep C stops. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MacTIERNAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I am pleased to be participating in the discussion on this report because I very strongly support the recommendations. I have been discussing these matters for quite some time with my good friend the member for Lingiari, who unfortunately cannot be here today to participate in this. I have had the great pleasure of travelling to Christmas Island on several occasions over the last few decades; I think I first went there in 1985 and have been back, I guess, once a decade since then.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a truly fantastic place. I would highly recommend Australians to take the opportunity to go to Christmas Island and see its truly extraordinary natural wonders, it being a great volcanic island in the middle of a vastly beautiful ocean. It is very isolated and very expensive to get to, which is why, if it is to have a future, it really needs to be able to lift its tourism product. I am very pleased to have noted over the period of my four visits to Christmas Island that, each time I have gone back, particularly last year to celebrate the extension of the mine lease, the tourism product has individuated. There are now small private accommodation facilities emerging. There are smaller hotels, cafes and shops that are servicing the tourism industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is very expensive to get to this remote island, so you really need to develop the economies of scale in tourism in order to make this a viable and sustainable operation and to provide that feedstock of work on the island. We know that, due to the stopping of the asylum seeker vessels arriving on the island, there has been a reduction, obviously, in the number of immigration staff coming to the island and therefore a very considerable reduction in flight schedules. That again puts pressure on the tourism industry, so we really have to be very focused about what it is that we can do to rebuild that industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not a great supporter of casinos. But I do think that, given all of the challenges of the island because of its remoteness, it is only by allowing and fast-tracking the reopening of the casino at the hotel that we can build that tourism package and product and that we can once again generate low-cost flights from Indonesia. In the 1980s and 1990s you were able to fly to Christmas Island really much cheaper via Indonesia than via Australia. There were many, many Indonesians coming over to Christmas Island to enjoy the pleasures of the hotel and casino, in a way that perhaps they were not able to do, because of various religious restrictions, within their own country. It really did give life, vitality and some diversity to the economy on the island. The casino eventually closed down in 1998 for financial reasons, but the hotel has now been in a phase of rebuilding. It is ready and the new owners are in a position to reopen the casino, but this does require federal government action in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has recommended that the government commit to reopening this casino and to putting in place the necessary policy, legislative and regulatory frameworks to allow that to be done without delay. I am not in any way being critical of the government in this regard, but it is important to understand that there has been quite a cataclysmic effect on employment on the island and on the use of the tourism facilities on the island from the absence or the removal of asylum seeker vessels and all of the supporting accommodation needs that they generated. So this has had a very dramatic impact on the island, and so it is really important that we act with some urgency to enable this casino to be reopened and to give substantial employment to local people on the island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased that last year, as I said—after I think these negotiations had taken place under both governments—the phosphate mine had its lease extended until 2034. That was great, and that also has provided employment. But I note that I believe strongly, as I understand the member for Lingiari does, that really we can have a cohabitation of the mine and the national park. That is not in any way to suggest that there would ever be any proposal for mining in the national park. We certainly would reject that, but there is other unallocated crown land that could be accessed without impacting on the national park envelope. I think that, in order to keep a minimum level of employment activity going on the island, we need to seriously consider how we provide for the extension of the phosphate mine life, and that would require, it would seem, some expansion of the mining envelope. I have seen some of the regeneration that has been done on the island of areas where mining has finished, and it seems to me to have been done well and to a high standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These very sudden changes that have occurred in the last year with the winding down of the detention centre really are impacting on the flight schedules and on mail deliveries, really putting a lot of pressure on the people on that island and putting enormous pressure on the viability of the tourism industry. So I think it is really critical that we get moving on this quickly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I notice one of the other recommendations, which I think is a very sound one, is to ensure that we allow the educational facilities on the island to provide educational services to full-fee-paying students. That seems to me to be an absolutely fantastic opportunity for Christmas Island to be able to provide educational opportunities for foreign fee-paying students who may wish to come to the island and have the benefit of an Australian education. I note that Christmas Island is only about an hour's flight from Indonesia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I am very pleased to be able to support the interim report, and I urge the government to get on with the job of facilitating the reopening of the casino. You will certainly have bipartisan support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  A letter to Alby Schultz: Dear Alby. When I arrived back in this place in 2004 after a six-year sabbatical, one of two since 1990, you caused quite a stir when you rolled the captain's pick for the agricultural committee chair. It seems you didn't care for the rural expertise of the PM's pick. You, along with Wilson Tuckey and Simon Crean, engineered a coup. This coup was unheard of in these contemporary times, when the PM's choice is an automatic untouchable. There was outrage and much gnashing of teeth in the corridors of power. It seems that nothing could be done; the deal was sealed by the standing orders of the parliament. To some, this was a career limiting move. To many, it was a show of absolute disregard for orders from on high. It was a decision fired by your passion for the importance of the parliamentary agricultural committee to regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that one act of defiance was not enough, you, Alby Schultz, welded yourself to my heart when you stood in the parliament and said that you did not agree with the stance I was taking in regard to the excision of the Australian mainland from the migration zone, but you applauded my bravery and upheld my right to speak my mind. Then you did so again, after a senior journalist told me that the reason they dropped a policy the night before instead of bringing it into the party room as was normal was to stop the party room tearing me limb from limb. My words to the party room were: 'I woke this morning trying to think, "Is there anybody who could tear me limb from limb?" and you know, I couldn't think of one person!' Then I said, 'There's only one person in this room who could tear me limb from limb, and that's Alby Schultz.' Alby, you said, 'No chance of that; I'll be right beside you.' I remember standing and saying to the room, in the words of an old song, 'Hit me with your best shot—fire away.' Not a sound was heard from one person—no attack speech; not a boo out of anybody. Job done, Alby. How I loved you that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, when, in the party room one morning, you were about to knock another member's block off after he made a smart alec remark, I was the first around to your office to see if you were all right. I need not have worried. You were fine—absolutely fine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am just writing to tell you I miss you, Alby. You were a real character with a capital C—a one-off, like Petro and Wilson. You just do not come across larger-than-life members of parliament who are utterly unafraid, who take life, policy and politics to the limit, and passionately pursue their purpose with pride and unending perseverance—individuals who are prepared to champion a cause, at any cost.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know that little coffee shop in Cootamundra where you and Glo used to have coffee? Well, Bron and I ended up there having breakfast. We looked a bit funny to the girls in the shop, in dark suit and black dress, so they asked if we were there for your funeral. They said they were closing for the day for your service, and put a sign on the door. They reckon the IGA sold out of black stockings. There were more dark suits and black dresses roaming around Coota that day than the locals had ever seen—quite a lark; they had never seen anything like it before!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, the girls in the coffee shop said: 'Around there, you're like everybody's other father'. Not bad for a politician, Alby, when the rest of us are looking a bit battered at the moment. I met one of your sisters-in-law and her husband from Melbourne. They really loved you, Alby. They came over and greeted us at the funeral. We felt very special.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, Alby, I'll miss you. Love to Gloria, the boys and those daughters-in-law you used to skite about. Hooroo, Alby.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  Can I commend the member for that wonderful tribute to his friend and former colleague.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise on a more traditionally political matter. I want to talk a little bit about the cone of silence that is surrounding a project known as the Perth Freight Link, and I want to address some of the nonsense we heard in the state parliament yesterday. As many members will know, the Perth Freight Link emerged like a UFO in the May 2014 budget—a $1.6 billion project which has an unusual quality in that it actually has not been planned; it was not planned prior to it being announced. We now find the governments, both federal and state, hurtling towards entering into contracts but refusing to release any documentation, on the grounds that it is going to damage contractual negotiations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a small victory in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal earlier this week. The department has been fighting releasing any documents—even traffic counts and traffic forecasts, apparently, as if these are high state secrets! They wanted $2½ thousand for some 88 documents. But, fortunately, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal rejected the government's argument that I just wanted these for my own personal interest, and said, 'No, these are clearly of interest to the public,' and waived those charges entirely. It was quite an extraordinary case. With the black letter law firm that they engaged, it probably cost them at least $10,000 to try to pursue a charge of $2,500. I think that is pretty typical of Minister Briggs's concept of value for money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week the minister refused to release the documents to the Senate. There was an order from the Senate for the release of documents in relation to basic traffic projections and traffic count cost estimates—that sort of thing—and the minister refused to do so. Interestingly, yesterday in the state parliament we saw a series of questions asked by the shadow minister for planning and transport, Rita Saffioti. She asked the hapless transport minister, Minister Nalder: the federal government was claiming that the state government did not want the documents released; was this why the state government was not releasing them? His response was that they were just taking the same approach that I—that is, me personally—took when I was Minister for Planning and Infrastructure when I would not release documents in relation to the Perth-Mandurah rail line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I have just gone through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> and double-checked and it is absolutely, completely and utterly incorrect. We went through a very extensive master-planning phase for that project. We released that. I released that master plan and all its supporting appendices to parliament. It was released to the parliament in August 2002, a good year-and-a-half before any contracts were entered into. There was the ability of the community to have a look at this project, at our projections and at our cost estimates so that we could have a proper debate on this before we committed to that project. We certainly are seeing anything but that here. The governments are desperately trying to enter into these contracts before a single document is released supporting this absurd project. I think the government will be condemned for that. We will continue the fight to lift the cone of silence on this absurd project.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROAD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  It is very important that when the government puts out some communication and non-government political advertising that it reaches those whom it needs to reach. There are often times that the Australian Commonwealth does need to communicate to the general population. It does concern me that, for quite a while, many of our small newspapers have not been eligible or have been missing out on receiving that communication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that unites small, local communities is a newspaper and that sense of community that comes from having their story told, and a lot of these little newspapers run on a shoestring. One time I added up over 30 newspapers in the electorate of Mallee, which is fantastic. Some of those are weeklies, where the person who is the photographer is also the owner of the business and the editor and the person who prints the paper. They might only have a circulation of 4,000 or 5,000 people weekly, but every single page, every single word, is read by those 4,000 or 5,000 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It does concern me that those papers are not able to access government advertising at the moment. If we truly believe in community, if we truly believe that these little businesses count, if we truly believe that we need to reach every Australian with our government advertising, I think we do need to consider how we disseminate our advertising so it is not just in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span>, it is not just in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, it is not just in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian Financial Review</span>. A journalist from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> once asked me for some comment and I said, 'Well, you can't buy <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> in the electorate of Mallee, and those who do probably won't vote for me anyway.' That just goes to show the importance of the small to medium outlet that local newspapers provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have actually written to Christopher Pyne because he is Leader of the House and leader of House business and it comes under his portfolio, surprisingly enough. I was a little bit disappointed with the reply. I will be writing to him again to put this case because I think it is essential that country people have that sense of community that comes from local papers. This also comes into a broader discussion when it comes to broadcasting. Recently, Mildura lost its WIN news. When you look at the act that was made in the Hawke era, back in the eighties, north-west Victoria does not have to have local content as part of the licence conditions; it is a kind of quirk in the act. There is a push on at the moment, through a campaign running on television called Save Our Voices, being run by Prime, WIN, Southern Cross Austereo and Imparja, to try and remove the reach laws restricting their broadcasting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand their argument. Their argument is essentially that, with the internet, there has come to be a more multimedia platform, and so the reach laws are perhaps antiquated. I have written to the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, saying that in principle I give conditional support to have that reach law removed from the Broadcasting Services Act, on the condition that north-west Victoria is re-written into the local content laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important, not only for my local community but also for all Australians, that, when we think about broadcasting, we ensure that we draw the links between what is going on in regional Australia to what is going on in our coastal towns and our cities. I have a strong belief that we have much to be proud of as Australians, that there are great stories to tell and that good news is the best news. Ultimately, as we look at changes to broadcasting, we should ensure that that link is drawn so that regional voices are heard in the city and city voices are heard in the regions. I also have a strong belief that, when governments think about where they spend their advertising dollars, they should make sure that every Australian has an opportunity to hear the stories of what is going on. So, for those reasons, I will once again write to Christopher Pyne, the minister responsible for government business, and put the case for our local papers being able to access our non-political government communication advertising.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  Near midnight on Thursday, 6 August, 97 workers who work with Hutchison Ports were informed by text and email that they had been sacked. Forty-one of those people were in Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                  </a>  I will take that interjection from those opposite; I particularly appreciate that, and I will pass that on. On Saturday at Curlew Street in Fisherman Islands, I met some of these people; some were from my electorate, and others from all over Brisbane. Some of you may have seen Aaron, who was on the news on Saturday night, standing there with his two-year-old. He is a father of four, with a wife. These employees were told by text that they had been sacked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, the company—and, admittedly, it is a foreign company, and so maybe does not understand Australian values and how we do things here in Australia—has not apologised for texting the 41 Brisbane workers or the 56 Sydney workers about their sacking. But, having walked among the workers and the community people who were out there as part of this peaceful community protest on Saturday, I know that people were heartbroken. Obviously losing their job is heartbreaking, but the way in which it was done compounded the anguish that they were feeling and the uncertainty. I heard, yesterday in parliament, Parliamentary Secretary Michael McCormack make the same statement that it was un-Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I take the interjections from the member for Mallee and the member for Leichhardt, and I do appreciate those comments. I am sure that you will make comments to the federal employment minister, Eric Abetz, who said that it was entirely appropriate that the company text workers to inform them of their sacking. This is the employment minister, who sets the tone for how employers think they can treat their employees. How could anyone in their right mind think they could do that! I hope they will take back to the party room the anguish that was visited on the workers at Hutchison, who are now getting support from the community. It was Ekka show holiday in Brisbane yesterday. Obviously these families, with their uncertainty, would not be able to take their kids to the Ekka, and so the people pitched in and put a jumping castle and a few other things on the docks so that the kids could at least have some sort of an Ekka holiday treat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the uncertainty hanging over these workers, there is more to be done. I know that they have gone back to the Fair Work Commission and that there are currently hearings in place where they are trying to work out what is best to do. Obviously the officials from this company need to understand Australian culture and that we value our workers. They are not just tools or widgets; we value our workers. We invest in them. They are skilled. Irrespective of the side of the chamber, as I heard from the speech of the member for Mallee earlier on, we value the local input, the sweat and the dignity that comes with work. Obviously this foreign company does not have all of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who have been sacked are abiding by the advice of the Fair Work Commission and working with Hutchison to get the best outcome for these workers. I understand that there is a little bit of competition because Hutchison had Sydney and Brisbane but did not have Melbourne and there are certainly efficiencies with having all three. But I know that the Australian people will be watching closely to see how this is sorted out. The Fair Work Commission can do good work, and obviously the MUA, representing the workers, is currently putting forward that case in the Fair Work Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I return again to the comments of our minister of the Crown, the federal employment minister. While I was wandering around the docks at Curlew Street, Fisherman Island on Saturday, talking to the workers, talking to people like Aaron, talking to some people from my electorate about how they were going to respond, at that same time we had a minister of the Crown saying it was entirely appropriate that the company text workers to inform them of their sacking. I have not heard the Prime Minister condemn his minister for saying that. I am sure he is a little bit busy with a few other things at the moment such as marriage equality, and I do commend those taking that forward—the member for Leichhardt particularly—but I would hope that the Prime Minister will condemn Minister Abetz for this horrible comment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  In many ways taxi drivers are the face of Cairns. They are often the first interaction that visitors have when they arrive in our beautiful airport and are driven to their destination. They are also generally the last person they see as they are driven from our beautiful city back to the airport to go back to their homes. In Queensland taxi licences are strictly managed by the Department of Transport and Main Roads, which determines the number of plates or licences that can operate in any given area. There are 137 taxi licences in Cairns alone and an additional 20 or so across my electorate. Each of these plates is individually owned. In many cases it may have been bought decades ago by a husband and wife team where one manages the bookings and the other one spends a lot of time behind the wheel. These microbusinesses may well represent their life-long income and retirement plan, and they certainly perform a vital role in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a massive threat looming over their livelihoods, and it is called Uber. The Uber mobile app allows consumers with smartphones to submit a trip request, which is then routed to Uber drivers, who can use their own cars. It is a cashless system with fixed price fares. It sounds absolutely wonderful until you dig a little deeper. Local taxi owners, drivers and operators Robyn and Nic Bakker from Total Taxi Management Cairns have alerted me to some of the pitfalls to this service and the threat to their financial viability. I am certainly not against innovation and competition in the market, but entities should compete on a relatively level playing field under similar rules.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland our Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994 makes sure that operators are accredited, taxi drivers are authorised and accountability for responsibility and reliability is of a high standard. It makes sure taxis maintain public confidence and a reputation for safety, whether you are a single female heading home after a night out or a local getting a ride home with your shopping. The same quality framework is not in place for Uber. Uber drivers only need to be aged 24-plus and have a driver's licence, an ABN, a smartphone and no criminal record. They need a car that is less than 10 years old and covered by comprehensive insurance. That is it—there is nothing else. The website whosdrivingyou.org has compiled a list of incidents involving Uber passengers being assaulted or kidnapped and drivers being found to be felons or driving under the influence. Unlike taxis, Uber do not have those common-sense safety measures such as a duress alarm, GPS tracking and security cameras. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a massive difference in the level of regulations. Robyn and Nic Bakker own two taxis, lease another taxi and manage 14 others. Each year the individual taxi owners pay $7,000 for their registration, licensing and CTP and $4,000 for insurance, and then there is the public liability and driver insurance. The cars are serviced every two weeks, they go over the pits every six months and they cannot be more than seven years old. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no wonder that many international governments are already taking action against Uber's tax avoidance measures and safety concerns. Robyn Bakker wrote to me and said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I wonder how it is that a federal government could seriously consider condoning an illegal entity who does not pay any tax in Australia, is not registered for GST and therefore pays none?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Please insist that Uber operates in the same business environment as the Cairns taxi owners, operators and drivers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The livelihood of not just the taxi owners and drivers is at stake, but every ancillary business associated with taxis, as well as the tax revenue that will fail to be collected if we all go out of business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, Uber competes directly with the taxi industry and I cannot see any reason why its tax treatment should be any different. I asked our finance minister for an update on Uber and have been assured that the department supports the Australian Taxation Office's move to collect GST on the first dollar earned. This is currently being tested in the courts, but the government stands behind the approach of the tax commissioner. To Robyn, Nic and many hundreds of other people in the business who rely on and support the local taxi industry: I will continue to actively advocate on your behalf, and I certainly look forward to catching up with you at your annual dinner at the Queensland taxi conference in Cairns later this month.</span>

For the last 28 years residents have benefited from the services of the Mount Druitt-based Aboriginal Medical Service Western Sydney. I have previously spoken within parliament about the important need for AMS to continue to provide culturally appropriate primary health care and coordinated allied health care, but for some time there have been concerns about the threat posed to the AMS by a combination of financial, taxation and administrative challenges. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interaction of these challenges led to two events. First, the federal government announced in late June that it would not provide continued funding to the AMS beyond an advised period of three months, which then triggered the second event, a decision by the AMS board to place themselves into voluntary administration. Both the Howard and Rudd governments had previously intervened to extend financial assistance to the service. In light of the current financial circumstances in which AMS finds itself, the question was asked: would a third wave of assistance provide a sustainable solution to the organisation's situation? The Abbott government decided not to proceed down that path. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The easiest thing for me, as an opposition representative, is to criticise and campaign against the decision. But I am not interested in politicking. I want a service to remain in our area for our Aboriginal community and I want solutions. I am taking this opportunity to report to the parliament and my community about the steps I have taken to achieve this. I have represented the concerns of our community directly with the health minister. I have spoken with her and with advisers to her office and the offices of the assistant health minister and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. In July, the member for Lindsay and I—as we share a conviction about maintaining the service in this area—met in my office in Mount Druitt with representatives of the assistant health minister and the federal health department about what could be done to maintain the service in our area. At all times, I have strongly urged the federal government to acknowledge three critical priorities relating to the service. These priorities reflect the concerns of senior members of our local Aboriginal community. The priorities are, firstly, that there be a continuity of service and, as much as possible, minimum disruption, and that our local community continues to access health care while a longer term service is being provided. It has been estimated that there are about 11,000 people who have used, or are using, the service. They need to be able to continually access that type of assistance. Secondly, I have indicated that the front-line people employed by the AMS should be maintained in their positions or that the same number of people continue to provide service to our local community. Thirdly, in the interim and into the long-term the voices of the local community should be represented in an advisory committee and there should be local control, and the maintenance of that control, by the Aboriginal community in relation to healthcare services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At all times the government have indicated their willingness to observe those three priorities. To their credit, they have worked within the federal and the state jurisdiction to see what can be done. I am particularly grateful for the involvement of a Medicare Local—now renamed WentWest—through the leadership of Walter Kmet. He is providing a degree of assistance in the transition period and I thank him. I understand that the member for Lindsay has coordinated within her area an equal service to also provide some assistance in the short term. The only criticism I have is that I have asked a number of times that all the patients of the service be either emailed or written to and be advised about what is happening with the service and the fact that the service will be maintained. I do not believe that an adequate communications strategy has been employed and I remain hopeful that there will be appropriate actions taken in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to the point: it looks like there will be a maintenance of service. If the Abbott government is maintaining service within the existing funding envelope, then that is good and that is proper and I will support that. If this is a mechanism to shut down the service, I will be one of the most vocal opponents of what is being done, but I see very little evidence at this point that this is what is happening. It is clear that both sides of politics are working together very actively to ensure that our local community maintains a health service in an appropriate and quality way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I rise to talk about what is a very significant issue for more than half of the globe's population—women. The issue is family planning. We know that, if women do not have access to family planning, they cannot hope to space the births of their children in a way that gives each child a chance to grow and be properly nourished, especially if they are in a developing and impoverished nation. Women without family planning support or contraception access cannot manage the number of children they give birth to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, we have a focus on women and girls in our foreign aid program. I am so proud that now, when funds—which are, of course, taxpayer funds—are directed to aid projects, some 80 per cent of those projects must reflect the needs of women and children, particularly women and girls. This is the first time our government has stated this priority and emphasis and I am proud that it has. In particular, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which has only recently opened a branch office in Australia and has long been supported through the Australian aid program, in very recent times has launched an online campaign calling on the Australian community to pledge their support to maintain Australia's longstanding and generous commitment to sexual and reproductive health and rights. There was an extraordinary response to this online campaign. They gathered more than 9,950 signatures from across Australia. This is, in fact, a powerful statement that Australians understand that sexual and reproductive health and rights are critical to empowering and supporting women and girls and promoting economic growth. I want to table this report, and I understand that that can be done, so that it is placed on the parliamentary record for all time. There are numbers of comments that go along with the signatures, which come from all states. I seek leave to present this document so that it is placed on the parliamentary record for all time.</span>

                  </a>  I also want to say that, of course, two-thirds of all people living in extreme poverty are women. Family planning or reproductive health services are key to creating that more equal environment for women, helping them to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. Therefore I was very disappointed when I saw the final 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These are the new sustainable development goals which replace the Millennium Development Goals, which are a major part of the architecture of the United Nations now. We have some 17 goals, and they are all commendable of course. But when you get to goal 5, which is to 'achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls', it is the only goal amongst the 17 which has no dates or targets for when the outcomes are to be achieved. Therefore, real measurement is going to be extremely difficult for the outcomes. For example, goal 5.1 is 'end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere'. We need a date, a target. By when? By the next century? By the next 30 years? There is no date. The next one is 'eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation'—an admirable goal. I wholeheartedly support it, as would most women on the planet, but again there is no reference to a time frame for when this elimination of all forms of violence should be achieved. It goes on: 'eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilations'. No targets, no goals, no dates. Yet throughout the rest of the 17 goals—for example, 'ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all'—before every target there is a date—by 2020 or by 2030. There is date upon date upon date. If you cannot have a proper measurement of an outcome, because there has been no understanding of when that outcome could be achieved, I think that really does suggest that there was less overarching and genuine support for this goal 5. I am saddened by that. I spent a number of weeks working in the United Nations in New York at the end of last year, and we were concerned that there might have been a watering down of this goal. I really hope that that was not behind the elimination of targets, but there we have it—there are no targets for goal 5.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):     I rise to congratulate the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, ASCIA, and Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia, on the successful launch of the National Allergy Strategy last week. I really commend this document to all of my colleagues in this parliament, because there is somebody in your electorate, somebody in your family, who is afflicted by an allergy that could be serious and life threatening. The launch of the strategy is the culmination of years of research, extensive consultation and hard work, and it offers a comprehensive set of solutions to the problems of managing the serious risks to health and life that allergic diseases pose.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than four million Australians are currently affected by allergic disease. It is one of the fastest growing diseases in Australia, although we do not entirely know why. Almost 20 per cent of the Australian population has a confirmed allergic disease, hospital admissions for anaphylaxis have increased fivefold in the last 20 years and 10 per cent of infants have an immediate food allergy. That is one in 10 babies with a potentially life threatening food allergy. For new parents it is often difficult to navigate the sometimes conflicting advice about what food to introduce, and when, in their child's first year—conflicting advice that has developed through a lack of proper awareness of what is actually best practice, and unclear and inconsistent clinical guidelines across jurisdictions. Many parents may still be told to hold back on foods that are likely to cause allergic reactions until after their child is older than 12 months, when in fact the most up-to-date research suggests that the later those foods are introduced, the more likely it is that the child will develop an allergy to them. The National Allergy Strategy brings together all of the evidence about what is known to work and offers governments vital tools, such as a consistent approach to allergy prevention and more effective ways of organising care, so that expertise is more available to patients and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to be joined this week by leading paediatric allergy specialist Associate Professor Richard Loh and Maria Said, President of Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia, who together chaired the National Allergy Strategy steering committee along with Dr Melanie Wong, president of ASCIA, and a significant number of other colleagues from across the parliament for our launch of the Parliamentary Allergy Alliance on Monday. I would like to thank the co-chairs, Senator Richard Di Natale and the member for Boothby. Richard and Maria have been driving forces for change in the way we approach allergy and I want to put on record my thanks to them and to everyone in the organisations they represent for their advocacy and persistence. It is hard work and they do it with passion and expertise. They do it on top of everything in their busy lives. It is also work that is helping to change lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Chiu Lam and his daughter told us about the tragedy of their experience with anaphylaxis. Dr Lam told us about his two beautiful daughters, Penelope and Isobelle, who both developed serious allergies when they were very young. Among their many food allergies—and they are numerous—was a milk allergy. A milk allergy is one of the most serious allergies and, sadly, many people confuse it with being lactose intolerant, which it is not. A milk allergy causes an anaphylactic reaction to particular milk proteins. The family were always extremely careful about the food their children ate. One night, a friend brought a dessert to their home. They discussed what the ingredients were, they itemised everything and they thought that it would be safe for the girls to eat. They were assured that it was a particular dessert containing only flour, sugar and water. It did not; it also contained milk. The two girls, Isobelle and Penelope, had anaphylactic reactions. Tragically, later that night Penelope, just eight years old, died. Isobelle, fortunately, went on to make a full recovery. She is now a gorgeous seven-year-old girl—eight in October, she tells us. She desperately misses her sister, a sister she loved more than anything. On Monday, this brave seven—soon to be eight—year-old stood in front of a room of members and senators in this place and told us in her own words how she does not want this to happen to anybody else ever again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is exactly the kind of tragedy that the National Allergy Strategy can help us prevent through a consistent national approach and through formal recognition of allergic disease, a chronic condition that requires treatment and proper management. It is a disease that can kill people and we need to understand this tragedy. It is excellent news that the Minister for Health has asked the department to provide funding to ASCIA to assist in consulting with the states and territories on the strategy—and I thank her—but I encourage the minister and future health ministers to seriously consider the genuine merits of the National Allergy Strategy and become the health minister who ensures it is implemented across the country and that allergic disease is listed alongside diseases like asthma and diabetes as a chronic condition—a life-threatening condition that can take the life of a beautiful child who will not get to grow and see even year 7.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  Recently, this parliament established the Australian-Azerbaijani Parliamentary Friendship Group, and I am very pleased that the Chief Government Whip endorsed my request to chair this group. The Republic of Azerbaijan is not a nation that many Australians know much about. It is situated in the south Caucasus, bordering Russia to the north, Georgia, Armenia and Turkey to the west, Iran to the south and the Caspian Sea to the east. Azerbaijan has experienced high economic growth due to its vast reserves of Caspian Sea oil and gas. Although Azerbaijan's economy is heavily reliant on oil and gas production, they are seeking to diversify their economy given the challenges of lower oil prices. With regard to oil exports, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline extends over 1,770 kilometres from Baku via Georgia and into the Mediterranean Turkish port of Ceyhan, where the oil is loaded onto tankers for Europe. Just last year in September, BP began construction of the Southern Gas Corridor. By 2019, it will link reserves from the Shah Deniz field to Europe via Turkey.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The capital city is the very modern and advanced city of Baku. Azerbaijan itself has a population of around 9.5 million. Australia recognised Azerbaijan's independence on 26 December 1991, after Azerbaijan regained independence from the Soviet Union. Our diplomatic contact is via our ambassador in Ankara. Azerbaijan established an embassy in Australia in June 2013, and I acknowledge the efforts of the ambassador, His Excellency Mr Rovshan Jamshidov, and his staff here in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the opportunity to visit Azerbaijan at the invitation of the Chairman of the Australian-Azerbaijani Parliamentary Friendship Group, Mr Khanlar Fatiyev MP. I acknowledge the efforts in Perth of great friends of Azerbaijan Mr John Hammond of Hammond Legal and Ms Aida Rzaeva. They worked and continue to work with Mr Fatiyev to promote the relationship between Australia and Azerbaijan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With my colleagues in the federal parliament and, in particular, the deputy chair, Alan Griffin MP, we are now looking to advance that relationship—at the political level, yes, but also through so many other facets of a potentially very good trade relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we recently had a chance to visit Azerbaijan, and it was a most interesting visit. As I also said, Baku is a modern and impressive city. The nation itself is clearly a very good example of a democracy at work, where there is great respect for different religions and even ethnicities. We should certainly acknowledge the location of Azerbaijan and the challenges that it has as a result. Russia, to the north, is unhappy with Azerbaijan's involvement with the European Union. Iran, to the south, is also a Shiah Muslim country but with much different views on the observance of religion, and they frequently show their views to Azerbaijan. To the west, there is Armenia, closely allied with Russia and the illegal occupiers of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. This is a challenging geopolitical landscape and the way in which they have established a functioning democracy and a nation with great respect for different faiths should be an example to others in the region. The Republic of Azerbaijan is a Shiah Muslim country, but it was interesting to visit a Jewish synagogue in Quba and see churches and mosques all allowing worshippers to observe their respective faiths without fear of persecution. I met several people who were Muslim but married Jewish people. Also, despite the ongoing issues with Armenia, I met people who were part Armenian, and that was no problem in Azerbaijan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year Azerbaijan hosted the first European Games, in Baku, and a few years ago the Eurovision Song Contest was held in the city. These events were an endorsement of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and a close look at that nation demonstrates its success as a nation and the success of all of its people, and we should acknowledge these matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  font-weight:bold;&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:11.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  color:gray;" />I know that the United Nations has raised human rights issues about Azerbaijan. As the chair of the friendship group, I plan for the members of the group to examine these matters more closely. The ambassador of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Mr Jamshidov, and Mr Fatiyev have offered their full support for us to look at these issues. I note as well that, on 1 November 2015, a general election will take place in Azerbaijan. This is the moment when the state of the Azerbaijan democracy can be assessed. I have great confidence that observers will see that the elections are fair and that alternative political viewpoints will be heard. I think that the world should be objective on Azerbaijan. Yes, look at the nation critically, but also be prepared to acknowledge that, in comparison to its neighbours and, in fact, most nations in the world, it is a modern and stable country. It is an economic and political success. It is a good democracy where religious rights and the rights of minorities are protected. As the Chair of the Australian-Azerbaijani Parliamentary Friendship Group, I will do my duty to see that the relationship between our nations is strengthened and that the Australian view on Azerbaijan is fair and, above all, accurate. I look forward to an ever-improving relationship of mutual benefit for the people of Australia and the people of Azerbaijan.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  Just after 11 am on 9 August 1945, the United States detonated the second atomic bomb, on the city of Nagasaki. Estimates of the death toll ranged between 40,000 and 80,000. Consider for a moment the scale of this event. Imagine if, for example, the entire 44,000 people who live in Port Macquarie disappeared in one blinding flash; or, if you look at the higher estimates of the death toll at Nagasaki, imagine if the entire 80,000 people who live in Rockhampton ceased to exist in instant. This is the scale of destruction that stemmed from man's decision to use the atomic bomb.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must not forget that most of the victims were noncombatants—workers, mothers, children. Military historians have examined at length the issue of whether the American decision to unleash the most devastating weapon in human history caused Emperor Hirohito to surrender on behalf of Japan on 15 August 1945. I will leave that to the historians, but, on the 70th anniversary of the bombing last Sunday, my mind moved quickly to the only person I have known who actually saw the detonation of the so-called 'fat bomb' after it was dropped from a B29 aircraft known to its crew as 'Bockscar'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just after the bomb detonated, Australian prisoners of war on the island of Omuta, about 80 kilometres away, noticed a discolouration on the horizon in the direction of Nagasaki. Decades later, one of those prisoners described the sight. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It reminded me of those beautiful crimson skies of sunsets in Central Australia, but magnified about 10 times stronger, and it's vividly … it's never left me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That POW was Tommy Uren, who later went on to serve in this parliament for more than three decades and was one of this nation's most energetic campaigners for nuclear disarmament. In interviews later in his life, Tom noted that in 1945 he was glad the bomb had been dropped because it meant that the war was about to end and he could go home after years of oppression, including the time that he spent on the infamous Burma railway. He also said that, later, the more he thought about witnessing the explosion the more he came to realise that nothing could justify the use of nuclear weapons. He later told a journalist: 'As I evolved and understood nuclear war, I found that it was a crime against humanity.' It says a lot about Tom Uren that, despite losing his youth to the war and undergoing unimaginable hardships at the hands of his Japanese captors, he was able to disconnect his own experience from the broader issue of nuclear weapons and their impact on humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He came to understand that the world would be a better place without nuclear weapons and was happy to stand up and argue the point—anywhere, any time and at any cost. When he retired from parliament in 1990, Tom left us all in no doubt on what he saw as unfinished business. Tom said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… for the rest of my life, I will commit myself to the people. I believe the issue of nuclear disarmament is the most important struggle for the human race.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although Tom passed away on Australia Day this year, his comment is as important today as it was when it was made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a responsibility to our children and to the generations to come to promote a nuclear-free world. According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, there are 15,000 such weapons in the world today, spread across nine nuclear-armed nations. Even if global politics is no longer an intractable battle of ideologies as it was during the Cold War, too many nations possess nuclear weapons. We must work together to disarm, so that, when nations have disputes, there is no chance that their arguments will get out of hand and lead to nuclear conflict. This requires common sense and good will. In the words of British songwriter and activist Billy Bragg, in his song <span style="font-style:italic;">The Warmest Room</span>, the only way to disarm is to disarm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1959, Tom gave one of his first speeches in parliament in which he expressed his dismay that when conservative politicians debated issues to do with nuclear weapons their comments were laced with paranoid Cold War rhetoric about the evil of Russia and China. Tom said of this:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We on this side of the House do not want a hate session with anybody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We must do our utmost to stop nuclear tests. … Problems can no longer be solved by wars. We must solve them by peaceful negotiation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming from him, that had incredible power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the recent ALP National Conference in Melbourne, I was proud to be asked to launch the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons Tom Uren Memorial Fund. The fund supports ICAN's important work in Australia to raise public awareness about nuclear dangers and support for disarmament. I urge the community to get behind the fund for the good of humanity and to recognise the lifetime of peaceful activism of my dear friend the late Tom Uren. Nuclear weapons are part of the history of our world. At the moment, we are stuck with them. But, as Tom Uren always told me, it does not need to be that way.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:07</span>):  This afternoon I would like to raise the issue of air pollution in Sydney's West. I want to refer not to what is often referred to as air pollution—we often hear this as carbon dioxide. I want to refer to particulate matter, because particulate matter is killing people in Western Sydney today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particulate matter is a pollutant. It is the fine, microscopic dust that we see in the atmosphere. It comes from diesel trucks, it comes from wood fires and it comes from our industry. Particulate matter is measured in two specific ways. One is what is called PM<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">10</span>, which is the coarse particulate matter; the other is called PM<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2.5</span>, which is fine particulate matter. That fine particulate matter, PM<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2.5</span>, is considered more hazardous to health. The World Health Organization has actually classified this as a carcinogen. We know that it causes lung disease. It causes lung cancer. We know that it causes heart disease. We know that it causes children's asthma. We also know that the World Health Organization tells us that there is no safe threshold for this and we should be doing everything we possibly can to lower the levels of particulate matter in our cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great concerns about Western Sydney is its specific topographical nature, as it is built in a basin and so the air pollution collects for many days. Over the last few years we have seen mistaken policies such as the carbon tax. People think, 'Oh, I am doing this wonderful thing for the environment,' when all they have actually done with those types of taxes is to push up electricity prices. This has caused people in Western Sydney to substitute turning on their electric heater at night for going out and burning wood. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time ever I can remember, there are ads on Sydney radio from companies advertising to sell wood. If you drive around Western Sydney, every petrol station has piles of wood for sale. It is simple. If people cannot afford to heat their homes because we have driven electricity prices so high—and there were some 30,000 people in New South Wales who had their power cut off because electricity has been driven so high—they look for alternatives to heat their homes. We are seeing more and more wood burned in Western Sydney. It is that wood smoke that is actually the biggest source of PM<span style="text-decoration:none underline;">2.5</span>—the fine particulate matter. In fact, residential wood heating, according to government studies, is almost 50 per cent of that particulate matter. What we see if we look at the monitoring stations that we have—even though they have been inadequately spread and not covering enough territory—is that our monitoring stations in Liverpool have shown a sharp and remarkable increase in fine particulate matter in Western Sydney and Liverpool. The question is what we are doing about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on all sides of the parliament should make sure that we get electricity prices low. Any so-called renewable energy policy that drives up the price of electricity actually worsens air pollution in our cities. And, when I say it worsens our pollution, it worsens air pollution that kills people. It is that serious. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this government are taking action to try to resolve this issue of air pollution in Western Sydney. Our government has put forward $8.88 million to carry out research into air quality, green spaces and biodiversity. We are running a thing called the Clean Air and Urban Landscapes Hub.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next Thursday, 20 August, at 5.30 pm at the Hilda M Davis Senior Citizens Centre in Liverpool, I will be hosting a forum with clean air champion Professor Peter Raynor where we will look at the role that air quality monitoring can play in Western Sydney. This research will help to identify the best policy options for reducing atmospheric particulate matter. We will do this in collaboration with experts, the industry and community. This forum is open to all the public in Western Sydney. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think about the unintended consequences of our policies. Policies that the Labor Party is proposing, such as a 50 per cent renewable energy target, although they might fill some hearts with warmth and joy, will push up electricity prices. They will result in more people burning wood in Western Sydney, result in greater pollution and result in death. It is that serious. We need to do everything we can to lower electricity prices in Western Sydney, and we need to keep a close eye on our air pollution levels.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  This week in this parliament and in this House there has been a lot of debate both in party rooms and on the floor about marriage equality, and all of us have been engaged on that issue. It is also an issue that people in our communities have been engaging with and debating, whether it be through social media or whether it be through talkback radio. I myself, in my office, have received a number of emails from people calling on this parliament to act, to say it is time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the emails that I received is from Josh, and I asked Josh if I could read his email out to the parliament so that they could understand how personal this issue is and how important this issue is to people in my electorate and in other electorates around the country. Josh agreed. He believed it would be important for his friends that these thoughts were placed on the record:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Dear ms chesters. Yesterday a dear friend of mine died yesterday. In the midst of my sadness at her loss of life, I am angry and frustrated that she never had the chance to do something I had the chance of doing......marrying the person she loved. I don't know your personal opinions on the issue but thank you for publicly standing up for the wishes of the people you serve. Marriage is a social construct and society is saying its definition needs to change and be more inclusive. Thank you for continuing to represent me and the people of central Victoria. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Josh sent me some other words that he would also like to be placed on the record:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My friend was in her early 30s. She got engaged last year to her partner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I think that if the Australian government is going to recognize marriage, it should be for all citizens. This is not about changing marriage "in the eyes of God". At my wedding it was all about the love between me and my wife. My marriage certificate was not issued after having a fertility examination. This is about allowing my friends and family from partaking in this universal right. I think if you change to scenario from two men, to two people from different religious or ethnic backgrounds, the objections become absurd. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As I said, thanks for doing your job in representing you electorate and it will be an honor for you to share my thoughts in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Best wishes</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Josh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Josh's emails are just two of the many that I have received—personal reflections and stories about how people in my electorate, in my community, believe it is time for this parliament to get on with the job of correcting this issue and allowing marriage equality. It is an issue of equity before the law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the government and government ministers are trying to distract, talking about expensive referendums and plebiscites—plebiscites which we do not know will have any binding effect on this parliament, because my understanding of the rules is they will not—to try and delay and stall what is a very simple issue that this parliament could deal with right now. We have two private members' bills on the books. It is time. It is time for Australia and it is time for this parliament to get on with marriage equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Marriage Act is an act of this parliament and it is up to all of us as parliamentarians to consider the bills before us and allow a vote to occur. I call on the Prime Minister to respect the wishes of Josh, respect the wishes of so many in our community and allow a vote to occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago 85 small businesses took out two full-page ads in my local paper. These small businesses were calling for marriage equality, putting on the record their support for marriage equality. This is not just a niche issue or an inner-city issue; this is an issue that unites Australians around the country. They are saying: let's end the discrimination before the law. Let's make sure that all people can marry for love—not gender but love. It is about two consenting adults having the opportunity and the choice. It is time that the Prime Minister got out of the way and allowed there to be a vote of this parliament in the coming weeks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) What was the process by which Mr Shannon Farmer was selected as an independent consumer advocate by the National Blood Authority on the Expert Working Group and Clinical/Consumer Reference Group for Modules 1 and 2 of the Patient Blood Management Guidelines.(2) How and when was Mr Farmer appointed as a Patient Blood Management advocate and researcher by the National Blood Authority on the Expert Working Group and Clinical/Consumer Reference Group for Modules 3 and 4 of the Patient Blood Management Guidelines.(3) At the time that Mr Farmer was appointed as an independent consumer advocate, did he declare that (a) he was engaged as a consultant to a business promoting Patient Blood Management programs, and, as required by the National Health and Medical Research Council, (b) he had a religious affiliation that may have constituted a conflict of interest.(4) If Mr Farmer had not declared his commercial and religious interests in his role as consumer representative, why was he considered a fit person for subsequent appointment.(5) Given Mr Farmer has, following media revelations, now declared 27 potential conflicts of interest, many of a commercial nature, does she accept that his appointment as a "consumer advocate" calls into question the National Blood Authority's objectivity on the Patient Blood Management Guidelines.</span>
