The topics of these petitions encompass community concerns about issues including electricity prices, same-sex marriage, family violence and tertiary education. To demonstrate the spectrum of views presented in petitions put before the Petitions Committee, I present petitions today which reflect both sides of the climate change debate.</span>

These petitions are identical, except that they originate from different electorates around Australia. The committee has received 15 of these petitions to date, containing a total of over 13,000 signatures, which will all be referred to the environment minister for response.</span>

Falun Gong practitioners in China have been subjected to the most brutal and relentless persecution by the Chines Communist regime since July 1999, causing thousands to lose their lives from illegal detention and systemic torture. According to investigative reports published by human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific David Kilgour, tens of thousands of imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to forced organ harvesting for China's transplant market and lost their lives (www.organharvestinvestigation.net). </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition is from those that suffer from Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, their families carers and friends. I draw the House's attention to the situation of this disease. Treatment for this disease has been available overseas for 30 years and has been clinically proven. There are two products for this disease registered on the ARTG, however they are not funded or readily available in Australia and people continue to die waiting. This disease is caused by a lack of the protective protein "Alpha 1 Antitrypsin" circulating in our bodies. This deficiency causes our own body enzymes to eat away at the lung tissue - causing early on-set emphysema. The Commonwealth of Australia had the opportunity to provide treatment to the citizens of Australia in 1987, this did not happen and people have been dying in their 30s, 40s and 50s needlessly for 30 years. In other countries sufferers of this disease are receiving augmentation therapy which clinically has been shown to slow down the progress of the disease, this allowing people to live, work and survive for their children. </span>

Please show the same level of compassion that has been given to sufferers of Cystic Fibrosis and rare cancers.</span>

I draw the attention of the House to: Funding for the therapy for Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency may become difficult to make effective immediately as the therapy must go through the National Blood Authority which is funded by both the States and the Federal Governments. The additional time taken between all funding parties and the lack of time constraints on the National Blood Authority to act in a timely manner, will result in may people dying and becoming much worse. In the past the ACT OF GRACE PAYMENTS has been used to provide lifesaving treatments to suffers of rare diseases. This can prevent unnecessary lung transplants ($800,000 each) and improve the quality and longevity of life, maintain vital lung tissue and allow people to continue employment and be there for their children.</span>

We understand the need for the RRMA classification (Rural, Remote, Metropolitan Area), but in this case it has had a detrimental affect on the Bundaberg community. The effects of classifying areas almost identical to Bundaberg (Maryborough/Hervey Bay) as RRMA4 when Bundaberg is classified as RRMA3 and also by completely surrounding Bundaberg with RRMA5 areas, has caused at least 8 GP's to leave Bundaberg in the last few weeks; who cannot be replaced. Two Bulk Billing medical centres have already closed and One Bulk Billing Medical Centre performing more than 40,000 Consultations per year may soon be forced to close unless YOU support our fight to have Bundaberg reclassified.

While no offense is intended to any religious group with this petition, a foundational principle of our society is the separation of church and state. It is a notion expected from any person sitting the Australian citizenship test.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 1989 the Australian government has required university students to pay or pay back a large proportion of the cost of their education. It is not unreasonable to extend a similar requirement to refugees who are resettled in Australia and do not return to their homeland within 3 years. While no immigrant should be a burden on the Australian taxpayer our current system allows immigrants to receive a variety of taxpayer funded benefits. This is unfair to Australia's citizens and negatively impacts people's view of our immigration system. A pay-back scheme for refugees and immigrants would allow current citizens to benefit from financial contributions which can be used to support existing programs like Medicare and future citizens would be more invested in a country they have contributed to.</span>

It is deliberately designed to subconsciously, or otherwise, convince people that the item is $9 plus, rather than the $10 they must legally pay unless buying 5 or more items.

Here are just some facts of how terrible Air Pollution is; there has been 2.4 million deaths each year that's 1 death every 13 seconds because of what we created, Air Pollution is responsible for nearly 5 percent of the global burden of disease and is also the world's 4th most lethal killer. These are just some of the things that will cause the world to become unlivable.</span>

We can never fully remove use of fossil fuels and even if we did it would take hundreds of years. We would like to ask you to invest more money in cleaning air pollution and also find better ways to keep the air cleaner. Although you are trying to find cleaner and healthier energy sources we feel that it isn't top priority, which it should be.</span>

It is known that dangerous extremism is being preached in some mosques in Australia. Those mosques that have nothing to hide will have nothing to fear. As a government's first responsibility is to protect its citizens it is time that the government acts to oversee and monitor what is being preached to prevent any advocacy for beliefs that are against Australian laws. In the interests of national security and as a precautionary measure it would make sense to regulate mosques and monitor sermons to ensure radical jihadism is not being preached. We need to send a strong message that this kind of extremist preaching and behaviour is totally unacceptable in Australia. There are a number of countries on which Australia could model a monitoring system including UAE, Egypt, Japan and Saudi Arabia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Since the 1990s a citizen of Australia has been subjected to an illegal conspiracy to breach her common law rights by assault and battery and unlawful imprisonment and defamation in her access to Medicare Australia diagnostic services. This occurred after she realised medical practitioners discovered she had been medically battered by insertion of unlawful human implants but secreted that discovery from her. The illegal implants cause her to constantly suffer devastating physical and psychological harmful effects of sound vibrations perpetually emitting from the illegal implants inside her. Defamations involved trespass to the person including unlawful imprisonment under the South Australia Mental Health Act. Multiple other linked assault and battery common law breaches on this same Australian citizen include, denying her access to other medical services for nerve damage and dislocation of bones, and denying her all police protection intended under statute by Australian criminal laws. State Legal Aid refused to represent her in associated civil suits on the grounds the defendant would be the Crown, the State of South Australia.</span>

South Australia now has the world's most expensive electricity. Australia's Chief Scientist has publicly stated that if Australia completely removed all CO2 emissions, it would have effectively no impact on Global Warming USA has withdrawn from the so called Paris Climate accord. China is adding an additional 360GW of additional coal fired power between end 2016 and end 2020 (Sydney Morning Herald 14 May 2017). India has an additional 65GW coal fired power stations under construction, and a further 178GW in planning stages. (phys.org 25 April 2017) Australia's total coal fired power capacity is 4.9GW (Climate Council of Australia) Australia is implementing expensive CO2 mitigation strategies that will have no impact on Global Warming, and which are causing grave harm to the Australian Economy, to Australian Companies, and to the Australian people.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Education is a central pillar of Australian economy. Not only does the education sector employ nearly 8% of Australian workers (in CRICOS Sector alone), it is our fourth largest export earner, after coal, iron ore and natural gas, bringing in around A$16 billion in 2013/14. International Students pay high university fees to get quality education together with a quality life. During their stay in Australia as a student, they work in temporary job roles and play a significant role in national development. They work as per the visa conditions , earn money for basic living and pay taxes as responsible residents. To support themselves during their stay, they do minor jobs by completing short courses, such as RSA, Construction Induction White Card, First Aid Application, Food Safety Programme, RSG, Cleaning operations, Taxi Courses, and Security Operations etc. Because these courses are not relevant to their ultimate goal of study and had no impact on their educational plans or visa conditions, therefore hundreds and thousands of students have completed these courses from non CRICOS providers (Domestic RTOs). . However in the recent weeks, ASQA has enforced its one of 2016 decision on all non CRICOS RTOs to stop training international students.</span>

Even polyamorous relationships are able to have their property and parenting matters decided under the Family Law Act if it is proved they were in a relationship. In addition we specifically accept Polygamous marriages, and they are specifically mentioned in the FLA 1975 Section 6, from the stance of allowing them to be divorced under Australian Law although polygamous marriages are not a valid marriage under the Marriage Act . Yet we do not allow our gay brothers and sisters to divorce under Australian Law and specifically deny them this right even though their marriage may be valid under another jurisdiction just as Polygamous marriages are.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I ask that the Marriage Act 1961 and the Family Law Act 1975 be changed to allow same-sex couples, legally married in another jurisdiction, to be divorced in Australia if their marriage has ended, just as for their straight brothers and sisters. In addition, for the Family Law Act 1975 to be amended to unambiguously allow for any party legally married under another jurisdiction to be divorced under Australia Law. This change should not wait for the review of the Family Law Act.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair,</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter of 8 February 2017 regarding a petition recently presented in the House by the Member of McMillian (PN0038) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Medicare-eligibility for Baw Baw Radiology in Drouin, Victoria. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">MRI is a sophisticated and expensive technology. Successive governments have had to ensure that the provision of public funding for MRI is both fair and financially responsible. Accordingly, since its introduction on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), MRI has been carefully managed through the granting of Medicare eligibility to MRI units at specified locations. These controls help support the provision of high quality, safe and cost-effective health care for all Australians both as patients and taxpayers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Typically, MRI has been carefully managed through a series of formal expansion processes to ensure that health expenditure is sustainable and appropriately targeted towards patient care, whilst ensuring the long-term viability of Medicare. Policy priorities will be considered within this context and additional expenditure considered when it is responsible to do so. This would include any consideration of expanding Medicare eligibility for MRI units.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are currently no application processes open for MRI Medicare eligibility, however</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">should an opportunity arise to apply for MRI eligibility, my Department will notify the relevant radiology industry groups.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Mr Vasta</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence dated 22 May 2017 concerning petition number EN0159 regarding parliamentarians' work expenses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition called for parliamentarians' salaries and benefits to be reduced to be permanently put onto the 'minimum wage'. Parliamentarians' salaries are not determined by the Parliament. Rather, they are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, an independent statutory authority established under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also calls for a reduction in travel expenses for parliamentarians and for all expenses incurred by parliamentarians to be made public. I note that there has been ongoing community debate about parliamentarians' work expenses, which is why the Turnbull Government is undertaking the most comprehensive reform in a generation to Federal Parliamentarians' work expenses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In February 2017, the Turnbull Government abolished the life gold travel pass for all parliamentarians, except former prime ministers. Further, on 3 April 2017 responsibility for the monitoring and auditing of parliamentarians' work expenses transferred to the new Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (IPEA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Details of parliamentarians' expenses, including their travel costs, are currently published on the Department of Finance website every six months and IPEA will move toward more frequent reporting, to contribute to a more transparent system.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter of 22 May 2017 requesting a written response to Petition EN0171 which requests that the Australian Defence Force (ADF) respond to all domestic terrorist incidents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Terrorism in Australia remains of significant concern and is a persistent and evolving threat globally, as witnessed by recent attacks in Manchester, London, Jakarta, Marawi and Melbourne.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, the states and territories are responsible for responding to terrorist incidents within their jurisdiction. State and territory police forces are the best first response to terrorist attacks, given how quickly such attacks can occur and need to be resolved.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence's primary role in counter-terrorism is in offshore operations and capacity-building engagement with regional armed forces to disrupt terrorism at its source. Defence can also provide support to states and territories within Australia in response to a domestic terrorist incident.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 17 July 2017, the Prime Minister announced that Defence will expand its role in assisting the states and territories to respond to terrorist incidents. Under the proposed changes, Defence will offer state and territory governments specialised training and placement of ADF officers within law enforcement agencies to assist with liaison and engagement. This strengthened engagement will assist with consultation and pre-positioning of the ADF in response to a possible terrorist incident.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also strengthen Part IIIAAA of the Defence Act 1903 (Cth) to remove some constraints in the provisions to "call out" the ADF to assist states and territories. This will include the removal of the provision that currently limits states and territories to asking for ADF support and specialist military skills only when their capability or capacity have been exceeded. The Government will also make changes to the Defence Act 1903 (Cth} to make it easier for Defence to support the police response, such as by being able to prevent suspected terrorists from leaving the scene of an incident.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have enclosed a copy of the media release announcing the changes, which are intended to provide increased Commonwealth support to states and territories in their role as first responders to a domestic terrorist incident.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance to you. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr O'DOWD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth, I wish to make a statement concerning the committee's inquiry into the trade system and the digital economy. Trade drives economic growth and is now being done in different ways. The digital economy is an important part of how our business will operate into the future, yet Australia is losing digital innovators to overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new economy poses new challenges for market access restrictions, intellectual property rights, cybersecurity and data privacy. Australians now live and trade in a digital world and a global economy. This means that our trade system needs to both enable and protect Australians online in a way that it did not need to 10 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry is also turning to digital solutions to modernise their supply chain. For example, blockchain tools are digitising shipping, providing end-to-end supply-chain transparency, and our trade systems need to be forward-thinking enough to cope with these new technologies. It is a paddock-to-the-plate approach to trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry will look at whether our trade system is meeting the needs of the digital economy and if there are any changes we need to make and how we are to undertake trade negotiations to make sure we drive growth in this sector. We are keen to hear from digital innovators—from start-ups and digital disrupters to established online platforms. We want to hear what the barriers to trade are that the government needs to address. What are the challenges they face and how can we keep them working for Australia? We also want to hear from the business sector on cyber-resilience and what more needs to be done to support them.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say: without any hint of bias, we have some of the most spectacular coastlines along Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be a common perception that Australia's western boundary is the beautiful coast of Western Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In actual fact, the westernmost reaches of Australia are the boundaries created by the Indian Ocean Territories, that are closer to our Indonesian neighbours than they are to the Australian mainland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the distance, the small sun-drenched communities of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands remain uniquely Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deep connection of the local communities to their diverse ethnic and cultural heritage complements their Australian way of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the inquiry, I was fortunate to join my committee colleagues meeting with local communities on Christmas Island, West Island and Home Island to see this beautiful corner of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While many Australians may associate the region as a key plank of Australia's defence and border protection activities, the committee's inquiry also highlighted vibrant communities, deeply committed to Australian values.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The present inquiry and report is quite different to those carried out previously by this committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While several previous inquiries have examined economic and governance issues in the Indian Ocean Territories, the purpose of our inquiry has been to take a step back and to consider these territories from a broader, strategic perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this process, the committee has affirmed that the recommendations of previous reports remain as relevant as ever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The present inquiry reinforces and builds on the work of earlier committees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This inquiry, referred by the Minister for Local Government and Territories in November last year, considered a number of issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry canvassed the changing regional security environment and security contingencies in the Indian Ocean region—home to growing economies and an important trade route for Australia. The region is witnessing growing competition among major powers and these rapidly expanding interests in the region require a deeper understanding of this dynamic strategic environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Heightened activity in the region brings both opportunities and challenges for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In hearing evidence, the committee concluded that Australia's Indian Ocean Territories play a vital role in Australia's engagement with the broader Indo-Pacific region, extending our strategic reach well beyond the Australian mainland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard that this dynamic region is undergoing significant changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that the parliament continues to engage with the Indian Ocean Territories from a strategic perspective, the committee has been keen to ensure that this committee conducts a similar inquiry on a regular basis—and in our report we have suggested five years as an appropriate time frame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee considered Australia's strategic infrastructure assets on the islands, particularly those that further Australia's defence capabilities. In particular, the upgrade of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport runway, and the development of medium- and long-term solutions for the Christmas Island Warf.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report also recognises the importance of continued and strengthened engagement with regional partners through bilateral and multilateral exercises with regional partners. Such operations will ensure Australia continues to contribute to broader regional stability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting the strategic importance of the islands, the committee recommended that the Australian government consider extending these capabilities in the Indian Ocean Territories, potentially through activities including surveillance, naval patrols, a military reserve or cadet unit, and training exercises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommended that, where possible, the Australian government and its agencies engage with the local community, businesses and suppliers of goods and services, considering proposals for funding and planning on the islands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through its inquiry, the committee had the opportunity to hear from a wide variety of stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These included Australian government agencies and analysts with a deep understanding of the defence and strategic considerations that underpin Australia's commitment to the Indian Ocean Territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I thank all organisations and individuals who contributed to the inquiry by making written submissions or appearing at our hearings and roundtable discussions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to also thank my committee colleagues, who in engaging with the inquiry brought a range of perspectives and experiences to the report and the inquiry process more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I would like to thank the member for Berowra and Senator McCarthy who also took part in the committee's visit to the Indian Ocean Territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee thanks the residents of the Indian Ocean Territories who provided an important local perspective to this inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their warm hospitality and candour provided the committee with a vital understanding of the region along with the challenges and opportunities that it presents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has a renewed understanding of the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean Territories, which we convey to the parliament and to the Australian government through this report.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  Firstly, can I thank the member for Tangney for chairing the committee in the latter stages and for taking the committee to visit the Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Can I also thank his predecessor, the member for Canning, who initiated the inquiry and terms of reference and who left to go to a another committee. The member for Tangney replaced him and did it very adequately, and I thank him for the work he has done. I also thank the committee secretariat, who are sitting here in the parliament, for the work they have done. I also thank my committee colleagues, including my comrade to my left, the member for Canberra—she is not always on my left, but in this particular instance she is on my left. I want to thank her for her encouragement and engagement with the process, as a person with long-term and longstanding interests in territory matters generally, but particularly, of course, in the ACT. She has a longstanding interest in the Indian Ocean Territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indian Ocean Territories I'm familiar very familiar with, having been their member in this place since I first got elected here in 1987. I'm very familiar with the issues raised in this report. Of course, it is not the first time that issues to do with strategic matters relating to the Indian Ocean Territories have been discussed—not in this place but elsewhere. There have been elements of white papers previously, of course. We know that, historically, the First World War saw the sinking of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Emden</span> by the mighty Australian <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> off the Cocos Islands. The remains of that magnificent ship, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Emden</span>, rest on the bottom near North Keeling Island in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. We know that both territories were occupied by the Japanese during the last war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have been places where those we have fought have seen opportunity, and they are important to us now because we've used them, for some time now, as transit points. During the respective Gulf Wars we had our major heavy lift aircraft fly through Cocos Islands on a regular basis. We know that the P-3 Orions fly through Cocos and, to a lesser extent, Christmas Island, and are stationed at Cocos regularly. So they are seen as important in terms of our strategic interests, and that will be the case in the future. When we went through this inquiry, we heard a great deal from people with expertise in the areas of strategic and defence matters—including the Department of Defence—all of whom said that these island territories were of importance to Australia's strategic interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations of the report bear some consideration—and I'm sure they will be considered by the government and, hopefully, adopted—but I want to make a point about a couple of them, one of which concerns the development of infrastructure on the island territories. Certainly, in the case of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, there is a need to extend the runway and harden the runway. That needs to be done, but it needs to be done in consultation with the local communities. As other investment, where it happens, needs to be done on Christmas Island for similar purposes, there needs to be contemplation of engagement with the local community, where possible providing local community members with job opportunities and small-business opportunities. There's clearly a need for significant investment on the Cocos islands in particular, and to a lesser extent on Christmas Island.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that they are both important for Australia's surveillance of its territories. We now have naval vessels in and around those territories on a regular basis for our own border protection purposes. The people on the islands are very receptive to Defence Force personnel and to engaging with Defence Force personnel. Indeed, some argued for the development of a cadet unit on Christmas Island and on the Cocos islands. That's potentially going to be difficult, I suspect, but nevertheless it shows the level of interest from people on the island territories around accepting their role as part of the broader Australian community and as Australian citizens, and they need to be commended for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are a wonderful people, and it's in our strategic interests to make sure that those two communities remain viable in the long term. That means that other investments, not directly to do with defence, are undertaken. We need to make sure that the long-term economic interests and economic development of those two island communities are at the forefront of our thinking when we're talking about our strategic interest, because, if we don't invest and don't continue to invest in their economic and social development, then we'll soon lose the vision which they have for themselves and we currently have for them also.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of highly automated vehicles will have wide-ranging and significant effects, and it is important that the general public is on board with these changes. One of the main things that the committee was told throughout this inquiry was that public engagement is vital if we want the expected benefits of automated vehicles to happen in Australia. As the technological and regulatory barriers to automated vehicles are solved, it becomes more and more important that the social issues which will come from the introduction of automated vehicles are considered. The committee heard that the availability of automated vehicles should bring some great benefits to Australians: better road safety, improved mobility and quality of life for people with disability and older Australians, decreased traffic congestion and pollution, and changes to the way land is used, particularly in cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, automated vehicles will bring with them a series of challenges, too. Before Australians can be entirely comfortable in highly automated vehicles, they will want to know that the legal and insurance questions have been settled, that their personal data and their privacy are secure and that their concerns about safety have been resolved in a transparent way. The committee is also strongly committed to the idea that people in regional and rural Australia should not be disadvantaged by a lack of access to the benefits of automated vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's report makes 10 recommendations and, while I don't intend to read all of them out now, I would like to highlight some of them. In recommendation 2, the committee recommends that, noting the range of benefits automated vehicles are likely to bring and the need for public acceptance of the technology, the Commonwealth government facilitate and encourage trials of automated vehicles in Australia, with a particular focus on trials that enable members of the public to experience automated vehicles on public roads. The committee made this recommendation because one of the main barriers to the public acceptance of automated vehicles is that most people have never been in one. Studies have shown that people are much more comfortable with the technology once they have experienced it firsthand, and so the committee believes that more people should have that opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recommendation 3, the committee recommends that the national cyber security strategy specifically investigate automated vehicles and associated transport systems to address potential vulnerabilities relating to automation. Another significant barrier, as I mentioned above, is that highly automated vehicles will generate enormous amounts of data, some of which will be quite personal to individual passengers. It is vital that this data is secure, private and trustworthy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recommendation 6, the committee recommends that the Commonwealth government's preparation for autonomous vehicles includes consideration of how the needs of people with disability, older Australians and those in regional and rural areas can be met via automated vehicles. One of the major benefits of automated vehicles is that they have the chance to improve quality of life for people who are unable to drive, particularly people with disability and older people. The committee thinks it is important that there are no barriers preventing these benefits from being available to those who need them most. Similarly, the committee believes it is vital that a divide in access to these benefits between those in Australia's major cities and those in regional, rural areas does not develop. The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government consider the merits of establishing either a dedicated national body or a cross-agency task force in conjunction with state and territory jurisdictions and working with vehicle and software manufacturers to coordinate Australia's preparation for the introduction of land based automated vehicles and the associated social issues that the committee has heard about during the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, there will be many changes brought about by the widespread availability of automated vehicles in Australia. Our report discusses some of those. The committee believes it is important that this work continues. If Australians are to reap the undoubted benefits of automated vehicles, we need to ensure we are prepared for these changes, including how the impact on employment is managed, how people in rural and regional Australia can better access these benefits, how legal and safety dilemmas are answered and many more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee received nearly 50 written submissions and held 10 public hearings, with a total of over 30 witnesses, over the course of the inquiry. We also conducted four inspections, including riding on an automated bus in Perth and in a highly automated car here in Canberra. I would like to thank those individuals and organisations who took the time to contribute to this inquiry and help the committee to identify some of the key issues and solutions. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I thank madam chair for her work on this committee. I rise to speak to the tabling of this report, a very important report for our time, for our days, a report on the social issues relating to land based automated vehicles in Australia. I was very pleased to be the deputy chair of this committee; and I had the chance to chair one of the hearings, which was a great experience, down in Melbourne. The chair has already outlined some of the committee's main findings and recommendations. I want to speak to some of the other recommendations because they're important themes for this inquiry. In recommendation 4, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth government further investigate the issue of data rights for consumers, vehicle manufacturers and third parties such as insurers and relevant government agencies. I would like to thank the member for Lyons, who had a particular interest in this area and provided some great thinking for the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair has already discussed some of these data and privacy issues. They are incredibly important for us to consider. There is going to be an incredible amount of data produced. A benefit of that is that it could explain to us how and why an accident between two automated vehicles may have occurred. Hopefully, automated vehicles won't crash into each other. But if any vehicles do come into contact with each other, that data will help to ascertain how that may have occurred and will reduce the amount of accidents on our roads overall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ownership issue that we've spoken about is important to work through. Recommendation 5 is that the Commonwealth government establish a working party with industry and academic stakeholders to identify those industry needs and to look at support services and a strategy—how we can best exploit emerging opportunities and also how as seamlessly as possible we can move into this new future not only for public transport but for private transport as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the inquiry's main themes was the impact of automated vehicles on employment, and obviously a lot of drivers out there may be a little bit nervous about what this automated future looks like. It's important that we look at the skill sets that are going to be involved and have a clear understanding of where the jobs may be lost, but there are also opportunities for future jobs. As these new technologies develop in the coming years and decades, we need to be well placed to contribute to the opportunities of those emerging technologies but also clear eyed about those that are going to be affected by the change in employment circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 7 went to the Commonwealth government in association with the state and territory governments and local councils—the three levels of government—considering trials. When it comes to trials in my own electorate, I'm very proud to say that we've been trialling automated vehicles in Darwin for some time. First, we had a trial down at Stokes Hill Wharf in our tourism precinct down at the waterfront. It was a very short distance travelled by a semi-autonomous vehicle. Then it was a longer stretch of road down by the waterfront. This month we are running stage 3 of the automated vehicle trial in Darwin city, where we will have people actually driving down the Esplanade in Darwin. Almost 5,000 people have taken part in those trials so far, and it went to what the chair mentioned before about more opportunities for Australians to be involve in these trials. That will give the general public a bit more of an understanding about the issues involved in this transition but also a little bit more trust in this technology and the transition. I think those experiences are important for the Australian people to get an understanding of how these technologies operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to remember—and I know the chair does, as I do, as we are from regional areas of Australia—that we need to continually look at how these technologies are going to improve life in regional areas of Australia. I join the chair in thanking all those who contributed to the inquiry, in particular the secretariat. We've had a number of people working on the secretariat. Thank you for your work. I also thank the other members of the committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 to narrow the circumstances under which an enterprise agreement can be terminated when it has passed its nominal expiry date. Under the current act, an expired agreement that is still in force can be terminated unilaterally by the employer if the Fair Work Commission considers it appropriate and not contrary to the public interest. This bill would simply prevent the commission from terminating any agreement if it would result in less favourable terms and conditions for any employee covered by the agreement. It would also invalidate any decision of the Fair Work Commission to terminate an agreement since 22 April 2015 if the decision would not have met the new requirements in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill responds to significant concern about expired agreements being terminated by employers in order to force employees on to lower wages and conditions. The bill is necessary because the practice has become more common in recent years, particularly since the Fair Work Commission decision in Aurizon Operations Limited; Aurizon Network Pty Ltd; and Australia Eastern Railroad Pty Ltd on 22 April 2015. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aurizon decision—which is how I will summarise it—more than two years ago is credited with creating a troubling precedent that has led to some employers resorting to what has been described as the 'nuclear option' of industrial tactics. In short, employers threaten to, and indeed do, go to the Fair Work Commission to terminate expired workplace agreements and return workers to less generous awards rates. Faced with this, workers are forced onto less favourable enterprise agreements, thereby losing the wages and conditions they and others had fought for over many decades. As far as negotiating tactics go, they don't come any stronger or more potent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, transport, power and mining businesses have wholeheartedly embraced this nuclear option. And in the fallout workers have lost thousands of dollars in pay and had their leave cut, and in some cases regional communities and towns have been left devastated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2015 Aurizon decision, the full bench of the Fair Work Commission ordered that a number of expired enterprise agreements covering Aurizon and its employees would terminate the following month. The commission found that the termination of the agreements was not contrary to the public interest and said that, 'the bargaining parties needed to set their attention on appropriate terms and conditions of employment that focussed, not on the past, but on the circumstances that prevail in 2015 and those which are foreseeable beyond'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, this decision significantly shifted the commission's approach to the termination of agreements that have reached their nominal expiry date but are still in force. As a result, a string of cases have followed where employers have successfully applied to the Fair Work Commission to rip up expired enterprise agreements despite justified protests from unions and workers. These include the high-profile case of Griffin Coal. In that instance, wages were slashed by 43 per cent and this cut retrospectively applied to accrued annual leave and long-service leave. As you can imagine, the impact of this decision on the town of Collie in Western Australia has been devastating. It's not just individuals, but whole communities, who are suffering due to this loophole which must be closed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, sadly, the termination of agreements in the Fair Work Commission is commonplace. Hard-won wages and conditions are being driven down and employers enjoy a massive unfair advantage in negotiations for new agreements. Indeed the Aurizon precedent has been blamed for a reported explosion of enterprise agreement terminations from 156 in 2014, to 517 in 2016.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are obviously troubling statistics, in a time of record low-wages growth, particularly when you consider that each of the hundreds of terminated agreements potentially represent entire workforces, or communities as in the case of Collie, driven onto lower wages and conditions. We can't allow this to go on. We can't have workers going backwards. We don't want nuclear warfare in our enterprise bargaining. This is not the path to productivity. This is not the path to fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Which brings me back to the bill I present today, because the simplest approach to stopping employers from using the nuclear option, is for this parliament to change the law as it applies to termination of expired enterprise bargaining agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would create a level playing field for employees and employers because it would prevent the Fair Work Commission from terminating an agreement if it would result in employees going backwards. It would also invalidate any decision of the commission to terminate an agreement since the Aurizon decision in 2015 if the subsequent decisions would not have met the new requirements in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last month, in a landmark decision that sent shockwaves across the country, Murdoch University became the first public institution to use the nuclear option, when the Fair Work Commission ended the enterprise agreement covering staff at that Western Australian university. Of course this was a devastating and shocking move by Murdoch University for the individual workers who now face the real possibility of lessened conditions including significant cuts to salaries, super contributions and leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is also a decision with wider ramifications and one that will send a shiver down the spine of staff at universities around the country—including at the University of Tasmania where staff are working under the shadow of an expired enterprise agreement. Yes, Murdoch University has agreed to maintain some workplace conditions for six months, but the National Tertiary Education Union is predicting dire consequences for staff including cuts to salaries of between 20 and 30 per cent; cuts to superannuation contributions of up to 17 per cent; reductions of redundancy payments of up to 80 per cent; the withdrawal of paid parental leave; and the loss of two days of personal leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How are staff at Murdoch University supposed to negotiate a new enterprise agreement in this situation when the employer has its finger ready at the trigger? Frankly it's a terrible power imbalance that gives employers a most formidable weapon and puts staff between a rock and a hard place. Of course there will be enormous pressure on workers, trying to bargain in this unfair environment, to sign onto new agreements with lesser conditions than they would have accepted had they been negotiating on a level playing field. No wonder the NTEU has been inundated with emails from concerned staff from Murdoch since the decision a few weeks ago. No wonder staff at other universities, including at UTAS in my electorate, are watching on in fear. What a terrible situation to put workers in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shamefully, sitting on the sidelines cheering on Murdoch University is Education Minister Simon Birmingham, who is cutting the teaching budgets of universities nationally. He would be relishing the prospect of up to 30 universities across the country cutting staff costs using the threat of terminated enterprise agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely this is an unintended consequence of the Fair Work Act, one that is being used as a weapon against employees. The rules of fair play have been broken and it's just too easy at the moment for employers to undercut their workers' wages and conditions. Frankly the Aurizon precedent has opened a door that must be shut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of the Fair Work Act is to achieve productivity, and fairness, through an emphasis on enterprise bargaining. The bill I present to the parliament this morning would help achieve that because it would simply return us to the original aim of the act. In other words it would help recreate a more level playing field for workers, and their employers, by returning the emphasis to fairness and productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's nothing complicated about any of this. The bill would simply prevent the Fair Work Commission from terminating an agreement if it would result in less favourable terms and conditions for any employee covered by the agreement. It would also invalidate any decision of the Fair Work Commission to terminate an agreement since 22 April 2015 if the decision would not have met the new requirements in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I thank the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the National Tertiary Education Union for their advice on this bill as well as their support and advocacy on behalf of workers. It's my hope now that the government, and the opposition, will put their political self-interest aside and focus on the public interest and get behind this bill that we have before the parliament today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank the member for Melbourne for seconding this bill, and for his tireless efforts fighting for workers' rights. Once again it's left to the crossbench to stand up for sensible reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time the Fair Work Act lived up to its name, and intent, and I urge the parliament to support this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation has long been considered a great Australian public success story. It aligns and achieves multiple public policy goals simultaneously. Superannuation helps Australians to achieve greater financial independence in their retirement; it also aggregates financial capital, making it available for large-scale investment in Australian infrastructure and enterprise; and it reduces the cost upon taxpayers by reducing the need for age pensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet, despite strident successes, superannuation is not currently working for all Australians. Industry Super Australia and Cbus estimate that there are at least 2.4 million workers in this country who have been underpaid their super, creating a $3.6 billion shortfall in retirement savings. This is further estimated to balloon out to $66 billion by the year 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Mayo there were accounted for more than 12,000 employees who had been underpaid their super last year, missing out on an average of $1,748 each.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amounts to a staggering 28 per cent of all employees in my electorate who are entitled to employer-paid superannuation contributions, but they are underpaid on those entitlements.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">September last year, as a newly elected member, I met with two men, one young and one in retirement, who asked for my assistance to recover their unpaid super from their employer, a transport business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Travis initially contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman, who directed him to the ATO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Travis came to me with a mountain of paperwork, which was his considerable efforts in trying to recover his unpaid super for several years through the Taxation Office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 2009—Travis lodged several investigations with the ATO. For each quarter the ATO would find an 'employer debt established' but debt after debt never progressed to actual debt collection. Despite being owed thousands of dollars over a near eight-year period of unpaid super, Travis received just two small amounts from the ATO, and one of those 'payments' was a letter stating he had been paid just one cent. It would have cost the ATO more in postage than what Travis received—and really makes a mockery of this situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Travis liked his job; it is hard to find work close to home in my electorate. He just wanted his super paid. In March this year, after all those years, his employer went into bankruptcy. Travis, with his two young children and wife, is owed thousands from eight years of unpaid super. He has effectively been robbed of his money, and nobody is in trouble for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Terry worked with Travis until he retired. Terry is now 71. He needs to keep his superannuation account open, costing him money every year on the slim chance that perhaps, after several years of waiting for payment, he will see what is owed to him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I immediately raised this issue with the Treasurer and then with the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, I have been approached by many constituents who have been robbed of their super.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some employers simply evade their obligation to pay superannuation to their employees, and manage to do so with relative impunity. All too often, employees are either unaware that their superannuation is not being paid, or unwilling to pursue unscrupulous employers for fear of retribution or possibly losing their jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And for those employees both brave and well informed enough to lodge claims to recover their unpaid superannuation, the main avenue of recovery via the Australian Taxation Office, I believe, is woefully inadequate. I believe there could be a better way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill offers real solutions to the problems, whilst simultaneously also enabling employees to get a fairer deal on super.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to constitutional limitations, the superannuation guarantee charge currently operates as a potential charge that is only owed by the employers to the Australian Taxation Office in lieu of payment of superannuation contributions to employees. The effect of this is that the only legislative avenue for employees to recover their unpaid superannuation is by entreating the ATO to recover it on their behalf.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill includes superannuation within the National Employment Standards. This gives the Fair Work Ombudsman the authority to pursue the recovery of unpaid superannuation on an employee's behalf, but it also gives employees the legal standing and a direct legal avenue to recover their superannuation directly themselves, rather than being forced to rely on only the efforts of third parties—that being the ATO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, an employee's pay slip tells them how much superannuation they are owed by their employer, but does not tell them how much is actually paid. Even the vast majority of scrupulous employers only pay super once a quarter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would enable employees to track if and when superannuation contributions are actually paid to them by their employers, by requiring employers to provide employees with notice, such as via their pay slip, of when contributions are actually paid—or are not paid—for each pay period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To further augment this greater transparency, superannuation funds will be required to notify their members within 28 days from when a superannuation payment to a superannuation company that is reasonably expected, remains unpaid. This could be as simple as an email or text to the employee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill removes a loophole in the law which allows employers to claim salary-sacrificed super as if it was an employer superannuation contribution, thus reducing an employer's obligation to pay an employee's super themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also removes an exemption which allows employers to not make superannuation contributions to employees when those employees are paid less than $450 in wages in a calendar month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill removes the remaining restrictions on choice of superannuation fund, as effected via workplace agreements and determinations. For example, no longer would an enterprise agreement be able to force employees into a particular superannuation fund against their will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As soon as practicable after 12 months of operation, the bill requires the Commissioner of Taxation to conduct a review of employer compliance with superannuation payment obligations, and must include recommendations on how to further improve compliance.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I am very pleased to second this motion and, in doing so, I congratulate my colleague the member for Mayo and draw the attention of the House to how well the crossbench work together. There is clearly a problem—the minister recognising it, the parliament recognising it—and what we have seen today is a really strong demonstration to all in the community of the really good work that happens in cooperation here on the crossbench. So, congratulations on this bill, Member for Mayo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Amendment (Recovering Unpaid Superannuation) Bill 2017 really brings together many of the solutions that we know need to take place. In saying that, I call on the government to actually consider bringing on for debate, and a vote, many of these very sensible, very practical solutions that are coming from the crossbench. I will be working with the Clerk, with the Leader of the House and with the opposition on how we can bring this particular legislation to the House so that it can be voted on, and then we can have what this parliament does really well: the give and take so that we get better legislation through debate. I want to acknowledge your work, Member for Mayo, and say thank you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following a similar private members' motion that came through the House last week, when this topic was debated, I took an opportunity to speak to the minister and to ask for her commitment to follow through on this work. There are 32 recommendations made by the Senate Economics References Committee, and only some of them have been addressed—good to have some. I will invite my colleagues of the parliament to come with me and meet with the minister and her advisers as she explains some of her thinking. And some of the other areas I am particularly keen to work on include the impact of superannuation for women. We all know they are particularly disadvantaged in the workforce and their superannuation is so important, so I will look forward to my colleagues joining me in doing that.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I really want to say to the government is: come and walk with us on this next step. Bring some of this really sensible private members' legislation to the parliament and let us have the debate, as we know we need to do. Let's do something about it. Let's not just leave it on the table. Let's have the legislation that we need and that is so well proposed by the member for Mayo. Let's actually take action on this really important topic.</span>

It doesn't seem to have worried successive governments in this place.

He was later appointed a director of Santos; he stepped down this year. He made the decision against ethanol and then he was appointed a director of an oil, gas and minerals company. Mark Vaile was the second minister who rejected ethanol. He later became a director of Santos, another oil, gas and minerals company. The next one was Martin Ferguson. The next one was Martin Ferguson. For those in this place who think that I'm making a partisan point, the first two were in the National Party and Martin Ferguson is in the Labor Party. He is on WesTrac, he is the chair of an advisory board at Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Associations and he is a non-executive director of British Gas, the biggest gas-producing company in the world. The last one was Ian Macfarlane. He is the non-executive director of Woodside and head of the Queensland Resources Council, which is oil, gas and minerals. This is an exercise in impropriety. It's extraordinary and it's very, very sad, for the reason that people, about 600 or 700 people, die in Sydney each year as a result of this country not going into ethanol.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to move on and say that Treasury says that they have taxed ethanol. We're the only country on earth that taxes ethanol. Most countries subsidise ethanol, but we tax it! When those trucks roll out of the Dalby plant, or out of the Sarina plant or out of the Manildra plant, the ethanol coming out of those plants carries a 40 per cent tax burden. The petrol coming in from overseas carries a four or six per cent tax burden. I don't have time today to go into the reasons why, but the tax department believes that ethanol should be taxed twice but that foreign oil should only be taxed at the bowser.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety-three per cent of Australia's motor vehicle fuel is now imported. In total, we only have two weeks' storage capacity. So, if a couple of dozen tankers are blown up then in Australia we will walk, quite literally. There is no conveyance by which we can move from point A to B. All of our conveyances, except for the odd tramway here and there, are run on petrol. For those who don't know much about their history, they will recall that the European war was about Hitler trying to get to the oilfields. Stalingrad, being a great battle, was the gateway to the oilfields in Russia. And, of course, he was fighting across the Libyan desert. What was he doing in the Libyan desert? He was trying to get to the oilfields.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that most people in this place know that the Japanese went to war because America cut off their oil supply. But, of course, successive governments in Australia—ALP and LNP in this place—are quite happy that we rest upon the mercies of the Middle East for our oil supply. Twenty-five billion dollars a per year now goes out of Australia to the oil-producing countries, principally in the Middle East—$25 billion a year. On the Brazilian experience, half of that would be going into rural and regional Australia—into the electorates that I and the member for Indi and the other members on the crossbench here represent, with the exception of the member for Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Brazilian experience is that they've moved to and average of around 50 per cent, but all it had was a 20 per cent mandate. You start with a 10 per cent or a six per cent mandate, as they did in America, because the price is attractive and the price drives the ethanol. And so we have America on maybe 12 per cent today and we have Brazil on about 60 per cent, because they've been doing it for 30 years. We hear debates in this place and maybe a tenth of them are about CO2. Well, here lies the answer! People like myself have to say that the ALP and the LNP indulge in some towering hypocrisy here. They could introduce ethanol tomorrow, but of course they'd upset their rich donors from the oil companies and the gas companies if they did. And the proof of the cake is where each of these ministers is now receiving income—from the oil companies and the gas companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be quite technical about this. If you grow sugar cane to produce ethanol—and most of it would probably be coming from grain in Australia from electorates like the member for Indi's, I know the figures here—you would produce about 1,000 litres of ethanol from every hectare of cane. That would put about three tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Each hectare of sugar cane pulls 73 tonnes a year out of the atmosphere. So three tonnes are going up into the atmosphere and 73 tonnes are being pulled down every year. Whilst it is not as simple as the rather crude analysis that I'm using here, still, you've got the idea that ethanol is burnt the same as petrol, with the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but the difference is that, in the member for Indi's electorate, growing grain pulls it back down again. So it's simply going up and down. With fossil fuels, it goes up and it stays up. </span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />In the greenies' bible—it's not a bad book, even I have to admit that—<span style="font-style:italic;">An Inconvenient Truth : The Crisis of Global Warming </span>by Al Gore, what does he name as the first solution to the CO2 problems to the world? What is the first solution? Ethanol. But we haven't heard one single word from either the ALP or the LNP about ethanol and not even from their backbenchers. They've been remarkably silent, and yet we stand on the crossbenches, once again, united, asking what all of the world is doing at the present moment. Those of us on the crossbench the four of us represent regional and rural electorates. There are jobs for our people in the struggling agriculture of Australia and there is a benefit for the grains industry. The lot feeders are almost all foreign-owned, I might add. They are squealing blue bloody murder, because it puts the price of grain up 16 per cent. Where would the Victorian wheat farmers be if they were getting an extra 16 per cent? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many people in this place, I'm fairly sick of buying my grandchildren—although, for a lot of you, it would be your children—woomeras that won't throw a spear, boomerangs that won't come back and bullroarers that don't roar. So, firstly, we would like to give our tourists, whether they are Australian tourists or overseas tourists, a bit of genuineness in the product that we sell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Infinitely more importantly, First Australians—and I often identify, so I will here: we First Australians—might argue that the land was taken from us by the settlers and the people that came from overseas, and they might well say, 'Well, you're the most land-rich people on Earth, you blackfellas; you're the most land-rich people on Earth,' which, I suppose, if you look at the map, you'd say we were. But there is just a little problem here: we're not allowed to use any of that land. We can't get a title deed off any federal or state government in Australia. It's not hard to do; I issued 800 in 2½ years when I was minister. But that's far from addressing the problem. And there have been no title deeds in Queensland issued, effectively, it's a fair thing to say, since 1990, when the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government collapsed. So we can't get any income from that source.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as it turns out, we've been remarkably good at some of the most magnificent art, and it's a school of art. When the impressionists came in, there was a group of artists, and when people began to appreciate the great beauty of what they were doing, their art became very, very valuable indeed, and that style of art went throughout the world. In this case, we have styles of painting, whether dot paintings or Namatjira-style landscape art, which are very, very culturally identifiable as First Australian artwork. Well, that has been copied in China, in India and in Indonesia and replicated a million times and then sent into Australia and sold as genuine, authentic First Australian art. Well, of course it's not genuine and authentic; it's simply a copy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this matter first arose and was brought to our attention, a senior staffer in my office went down to three outlets for tourist souvenirs in Cairns, and 23 of the items—in fact, almost every single item, but there were 23 separate items in those stores—were imported from Indonesia, China or India. So here we go: 'Australian Indigenous art' is being produced in, and marketed and sold from, foreign countries—once again, sending all the jobs overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what this bill will achieve is that no longer will those jobs go overseas—they will remain here in Australia—and Indigenous art will remain the property of the First Peoples. Whether one wants to talk about whether land was taken off the original people or whether it wasn't, one thing is for certain: if this bill goes through, they will no longer take our art and our culture away from us, and I think every single Australian would agree with that proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We pay our thanks, our gratitude and our appreciation to the minister for setting up an inquiry. But, in this place—for example, on water development—all we get is inquiries. Nothing ever happens. On the issue of CO2, all we get is inquiries; nothing seems to ever happen in this place. So we want action on this, and I thank very much my colleague on the crossbenches for her support in this matter and her very great commitment to what is a cause of fairness for our First Australian peoples.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The road to peace for Israel is long and it's hard and it shouldn't be. Israel is the only free democracy in the Middle East. It's the only country that guarantees, respects and lives by the great liberal democratic principles of freedom of speech, of expression of gathering, of protests and all the norms we take for granted. Israel is the light in, at times, a dark place. You would think that peace would flow seamlessly from this. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and there remains too much opposition and oppression against Israel, not only in parts of Australia but also across elements of the international community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, as the chairman of the Australian Parliamentary Israel Allies Caucus, I place this motion unequivocally before the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament to affirm that we in this parliament support the right of Israel to defend its citizens against terrorist attacks by organisations or by individuals. We call on the Palestinian Authority to cease incitement of its population to attack Israel and Israelis. We further call on the Palestinian Authority to take seriously the task of educating its people on the options, process and potential for peace. We urge the Palestinian Authority to abide by the Oslo accords and, specifically, to cease attacking Israel in an unfounded manner in international forums. We urge the Israeli and Palestinian Authorities to return to negotiations in good faith and without preconditions. We acknowledge and affirm the Jewish connection to the Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem and elsewhere in Israel, we condemn unequivocally and unilaterally the Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions movement as inherently anti-Semitic, and we call on all Australian political parties and institutions to disavow it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My considered view is that peace could be achieved relatively quickly if goodwill prevailed across the Middle East, but I fear that there are many obstacles to peace remaining, and the main obstacle is Palestinian intransience, an intransience I have witnessed firsthand and can speak to with some authority. The last 17 years have seen numerous efforts at peace. It's a matter of historical fact that in 2008 then Israeli PM Ehud Olmert made Palestinian Authority President Abbas a generous offer of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and most of West Bank with land from inside Israel's pre-1967 borders to compensate for the rest so that ,after the land swaps, the Palestinians would receive the equivalent of 100 per cent of West Bank. There was to be a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, shared sovereignty over the city's holy sites, and compensation for Palestinian refugees and their descendants with a very limited right for some of them to settle in Israel. As Abbas has recently confirmed, he rejected this offer out of hand. This was a far more generous offer than the one in 2000-01 where, with the involvement of Bill Clinton, peace offers to the Palestinians were again refused without even a counter-offer. Instead, Yasser Arafat launched his Intifada which saw a wave of terrorism take the lives of over 1,000 Israelis, and was only ended by Israeli security measures including checkpoints and the security barrier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, in 2005 Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip as a continuance of the process of engagement. Since then, Palestinians in Gaza have fired more than 10,000 rockets and mortars into Israel and have used vast amounts of international aid to construct elaborate tunnels from Gaza into Israel to facilitate planned mass terrorist attacks on the Israeli community. Israel has been forced to fight three wars to temporarily stop the rockets and destroy the tunnels. If the Palestinian Authority believe this is a road to peace, they are sorely mistaken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as Israeli Prime Minister, Israel's effort for peace continued. In 2009, he instituted a 10-month total moratorium on the building of houses in the settlements. This would mean, of course, that young adults in settlements who wanted to move out of home were forced to move right away from their communities, from their families. It was, however, a confidence-building measure designed to encourage negotiations. Again, Abbas refused to talk for nine months and then only agreed in the last month to continue the moratorium.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 and 2014, Netanyahu yet again tried again with further confidence-building measure. He agreed to release in four quarterly instalments Palestinian prisoners who were in Israeli jails for murdering Israelis. Unfortunately, the talks did not prove fruitful. Martin Indyk, the US negotiator, said: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Netanyahu moved to the zone of possible agreement. I saw him sweating bullets to find a way to reach an agreement.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We tried to get Abu Mazen to the zone of possible agreement but we were surprised to learn he had shut down. We were ready to go beyond policy positions the U.S. had taken on the core issues to bridge the gaps and resolve it, and therefore there was something in it for him – and he didn’t answer us. Abbas [effectively] checked out of the talks in mid-February.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The talks ultimately failed when Abbas decided that he would instead seek a unity government with the terror organisation Hamas, something which is not acceptable to Israel and much of the international community. Netanyahu has continued on several occasions to re-affirm his support for a Palestinian state and offered to meet and negotiate anywhere, at any time, without pre-conditions. Abbas, unfortunately, has failed to take up the offer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question has to be asked: why is there this intransigence by the Palestinian Authority? There are many reasons. Could it be that a peace deal would actually mean a genuine acceptance of Israel's right to exist, including an undertaking that there would be no further claims against Israel and that the refugees and millions of their descendants—also regarded as refugees, under a definition unique only to Palestinians—could settle in the new Palestinian state but there would be no right of return to Israel?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we as legislators have to accept is that governments have a responsibility to deliver peace, security and the basis for prosperity for their people. This is what this motion calls on the Palestinian Authority to do; it calls on them to responsibly govern. Since negotiations last broke down, in 2014, the Palestinians have now pursued a strategy of using various international organisations, from the UN down, to put pressure on Israel and have sought to gain recognition of their state from as many governments and bodies as possible. In this way, they hope to avoid having to make the compromise necessary for a genuine peace and to be awarded their state in a way that enables them to continue to make claims against Israel, including the right to return. This is recipe not for peace but for continuing conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, the Palestinian Authority has continued to incite and encourage terrorism against Israel. This has included the Palestinians calling for Israeli blood to be shed to defend the Temple Mount from non-existent Israeli plans to, apparently, change the status quo. This particular call led to the car and knife attacks which have killed over 40 Israelis since late 2015 and wounded hundreds of others. At other times, the incitement and encouragement is more general but just as pernicious—such as awarding generous lifetime pensions to terrorists captured by Israel or to the families of terrorists who are killed, and naming streets, facilities and even children's soccer tournaments after terrorists. I have personally witnessed the faces of suicide bombers displayed from multiple streetlights within the Palestinian territory as a form of acknowledgement—in the same way that we acknowledge events or amazing achievements in Australia by hanging faces or flags from our streetlights. This is not taking the Palestinian people on a journey to accepting peace. This is entrenching the intransigence and the horrible status quo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state just encourages these destructive Palestinian tactics. As long as they are able to believe that they just need to keep doing more of the same to achieve a state, without any concession of Israel's right to exist, they will continue to do so. What is needed for peace is for the international community to make it clear to the Palestinians that they must cease their intransigence and support for terrorism if they wish to advance their cause, whilst making it clear also to Israel that it will be supported as long as it continues to negotiate in good faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some cite settlements as a main obstacle to peace. While the settlements are certainly one of the more important issues that need to be resolved, they are not an obstacle. Even Palestinian leaders have admitted they occupy less than two per cent of the land in the West Bank. Since 2003 there have not been any new settlements established, although a new one has recently been announced to replace one that's being dismantled, and those that exist have not been expanded beyond their existing geographic boundaries. Furthermore, most growth in the settlement populations have been in settlements that it is generally accepted Israel will keep as part of land swaps in any peace agreement. Thus, it is simply incorrect to say that the growth in settlements is in any way compromising the chance of a two-state peace. The settlements did not prevent Israel making its generous offers of Palestinian statehood in 2000 and 2001 and again in 2008.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The so-called boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is completely and utterly condemned as inherently anti-Semitic, and I call on all Australian political parties and institutions to disavow it immediately. There are challenges all over the world, but it's only to Israel that such racist hatred is directed. Charles Krauthammer writes well when he says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And don't tell me this is merely about Zionism. The ruse is transparent. Israel is the world's only Jewish state. To apply to the state of the Jews a double standard that you apply to none other, to judge one people in a way you judge no other, to single out that one people for condemnation and isolation — is to engage in a gross act of discrimination.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion calls on all parties to return to the negotiating table, and I encourage them to do so.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I second the motion and I congratulate the member for Fadden on moving this resolution. The issue of Israel defending its citizens against terrorist attacks by individuals or organisations would seem to be self-evidently sensible, but it affects the safety of people around the world because, of course, we all know that defending our populations against terrorism is indivisible in these days. The jihadist threat that is around the world doesn't exist just in Marseille or in parts of Marawi in the Philippines. It exists all over the world, and we need to confront it wherever it exists. Of course, from the point of view of equality and fairness, if a third of car rammings in the world are in Israel, we need to know this. It's a shame we don't, but the pioneering of jihadist violence against publics around the world often begins in Israel. What happens there is of great relevance all around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the Palestinian Authority continue inciting its population over the last 10 years, a period where there should have been negotiations. Most people don't understand what that means. These jihadists terrorists are not unique in their methods. The car rammings, the stabbings et cetera that we've seen—we saw a terrible one recently where at a Sabbath Friday evening meal an 18-year-old terrorist came into the house of a person who was having a ceremony for the welcoming of their grandson and stabbed three of the family to death. The odious thing about this, as the member for Fadden pointed out, is that the Palestinian Authority pays incentives, usually from international relief funds that they get, to people and their families who are involved in these things. If they get killed, the family gets the pension. If not, they do. It's estimated that a third of the PA's budget is spent on these odious pensions to terrorists or their families. And of course this only encourages—incentivises—people to do these kinds of things. It's an absolute shame. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This resolution also has an important point about acknowledging the Jewish connection with the holy sites in Jerusalem and elsewhere in Israel. Recently UNESCO, to its eternal shame, classified the Old City of Jerusalem as a Muslim site only. For the great city of Jerusalem we have to respect all of the great Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. History doesn't change because of a bunch of countries that make these ridiculous decisions in Geneva. The Temple Mount in Jerusalem existed 600 years before the forming of Islam. So it's absolutely and self-evidently crazy for UNESCO to decree the city which Christianity and Judaism have as their holy city as a solely Islamic city without acknowledging the affinity which that place existed with long before those days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me conclude with some points on the BDS. The founder of the BDS, Omar Barghouti, makes it very clear that the aim of this program is not—not—to change this or that Israeli policy. He makes it clear that the aim of the BDS is to replace, to eliminate, Israel 'from the river to the sea', as the extremists say. So this is not only aesthetically revolting and politically revolting; we have in the leaflets of this BDS movement that Estee Lauder and Vidal Sassoon should be boycotted. What do Estee Lauder and Vidal Sassoon have in common with a political campaign against Israel? They don't have anything in common with it. They're Jewish firms that are international. Both happen to be in the cosmetic area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's outrageous. It's a perpetuation of the 1930s for this movement to continue that kind of behaviour. I pay tribute to some of my colleagues, Wayne Swan, Kevin Rudd, Premier Andrews and David Feeney, who all joined me at anti-BDS sit-ins at the chocolate shops all around Australia, and Max Brenner. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I would like to begin by thanking Stuart Robert, the member for Fadden, for bringing this motion to the attention of the House, and particularly for standing up for the rights and freedoms of the state of Israel, which have too often been ignored in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that as a nation we have allies: allies who stand with us through thick and thin and whom we should reciprocate with. Israel is one of those states that should continue to enjoy the support of this country and this government and will continue to do so. My only hope is that we can say the same at some future point, should there be another government of a different political persuasion, because the reality is that we know there is not the same commitment as often sits on this side of the House. Every member of this side of the House believes strongly in the right of Israel to exist, to exist freely, to exist without threat or intimidation and to be able to provide a homeland for the Jewish people. I can say, as a member of this House with an electorate which has a very high percentage of the Jewish community in Melbourne, that my position is resolute and uncompromising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, the heart of this debate and this issue is whether we, as a nation, stand for enlarging the freedom of all people to live their lives in safety and peace. There are many other debates where we take a very similar position and should continue to do so. Having visited Jerusalem myself, I have seen the consequences firsthand of what happens when some people seek to deny that liberty and that peace—particularly some of the efforts of the Palestinian authorities and those who support them to deceive the public, or to make misrepresentations or to create misunderstanding about what actually occurs, particularly under the state of Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, on one of my visits to Israel many years ago, we were given a briefing about the activities of Palestinian Media Watch. This organisation scrutinised Palestinian media in particular and how they sought to misrepresent information to build a perception of victimhood that was not always in accordance with reality. Sometimes these examples can bring a certain degree of scepticism. I myself, being a first-time visitor, brought scepticism to some of the claims that were presented to me until we went to Bethlehem. We went to a refugee camp to speak directly to Palestinians about some of the challenges that they faced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we were there, we saw a group of young children throwing rocks at IDF soldiers. This eventually escalated to the point where the IDF tear gassed. I can say that I can tick off being tear gassed by the IDF on my bucket list. That's not a point of humour: it's just a point of reality, and anybody else who has been tear gassed will know that it's not a particularly pleasant experience. But the critical point came afterwards. What we saw were misrepresentations in the Palestinian media that we were attacked by the IDF. That was not true. In fact, they were provoked by those who were encouraged to throw rocks and commit violence against IDF soldiers, who then acted to defend themselves. This is just one of many examples where we see misrepresentations to try to build a sense of sympathy with the Palestinian cause—which I think many people have, but it should be rooted in facts and reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously spoken in this chamber about my frustration with the conduct of UNESCO in trying to deny and erase from history the connection between Jewish people and the Temple Mount. If you look at the effort made by some people who want to disconnect that relationship, it amounts to a cultural genocide of people's past and their connection, and we should not be ashamed or afraid to call it out. I acknowledge the select number of members opposite who are prepared to do that for making the same principle. As somebody who has Armenian heritage and knows exactly what it means to have had not just an actual genocide but a cultural genocide against their people, I say we must remain determined always to stand up against these measures, because it's not just about erasing people; the intention is to erase people's memory and legacy and the culture and traditions that inform them and continue to inform their future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in giving my support very strongly to this motion, I want to reflect on the ongoing discussion about whether our embassy should be based in Jerusalem. As a proud supporter of Israel, a proud supporter of recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and a proud Australian, I can see no reason that we should not be able to relocate our embassy to Jerusalem, on the basis that it is safe for Australians..</span>

Israel and Australia as we know, have had warm relations and strong economic ties due to our strong people-to-people links and our commercial relationship. The trade between our two nations is worth around $1.2 billion. We cooperate internationally with Israel in many fields, including international development assistance.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year represents the 100th anniversary since British politician Arthur Balfour, later Lord Balfour, presented a declaration of the British government stating the case for the Jewish homeland. 2017 is also the 90th anniversary of the Zionist Federation of Australia, and I'd like to welcome and acknowledge those with us today in the gallery, including ZFA President Dr Danny Lamm, Secretary Mr Sam Tatarka, former President Dr Ron Weiser, and my good friend the President of the State Zionist Council of Queensland chair, Mr Tony Leverton, who are with us today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people in our party and indeed across this chamber, like many people across the world, care deeply about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and are concerned about the ongoing conflict. The starting point of the conflict between Israel and Palestine is self-determination for Jews in Israel and for Palestinians in Palestine. Acceptance of the rights of both peoples, indigenous to the same land, means the only way forward must be for the two parties to negotiate an agreed outcome, recognising both peoples' links to the land and especially the Jewish people's 3,000-year ties to Jerusalem. In my opinion, unilateral recognition does nothing to aid negotiation. Indeed, it only hardens the positions of those in conflict. For all those of us who hold true to the values of the rule of law and negotiated resolution of disputes, there can no place for terrorism in achieving statehood for the Palestinians. The march to statehood for Palestinians, as it does for Israeli Jews, includes preparing their population for peace, acceptance of the two states living side by side in peace and recognition of the holy places of Jewish, Christian and Islamic history in the area. It means free trade unions in the region, a free media and free speech, and the rights of people of all genders and religious persuasions to live freely and without fear. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member for Fadden spoke of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement. Labor rejects the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign against Israel, and I add my voice to rejecting the BDS campaign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that both Israelis and Palestinians will need to make hard concessions, but conflict is not winner take all. Those who seek Israel's destruction give terrible, false hope to Palestinians. That is the lesson of so many years of wars fought between Israel and its neighbours. We seek the day when the legitimate rights and aspirations of both Jews and Palestinians to live side by side in peace will come. That can and must come from both sides negotiating directly. Two peoples in one land takes discussion and dialogue. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, whether in government or in opposition, will continue to work with the parties within the conflicts, our allies and the wider international community to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Alongside my Labor colleagues, we remain committed to peace in that region. I particularly acknowledge the good work and advocacy, over many years, of my good friend the member for Melbourne Ports, Michael Danby. I salute all of the work he has done for many years, and I welcome the opportunity to enter the debate today. </span>

I am reminded that Australia has had a long involvement with Israel. On 31 October, it will be the 100th anniversary of the charge of the Light Horse Brigade which led to the liberation of Jerusalem in December 1917. It shows that Australia has had a long involvement. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a pleasure to support the member for Fadden and the work he has done in this space for a very long time. Ever since we entered the parliament in 2007—and I am sure he did it before that—he has been a strong supporter of the state of Israel and very vocal and committed in his beliefs. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Melbourne Ports, who has been a consistent advocate and supporter for the state of Israel. I know that during the time I have been in parliament he has never shied away from making his thoughts and ideas known about that particular issue. I would also like to thank the member for Fadden for his passionate speech on this issue, which I know he holds very close to his heart. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like all conflicts, the issues surrounding that of Palestine and Israel are complex. I strongly support the member for Fadden's calls for Israeli and Palestinian authorities to return to negotiations in good faith and without preconditions. Peace is the goal. I'm sure the member for Fadden and the member for Eden-Monaro, both of whom have served in our military forces, more than anyone, understand the pursuit of peace because they know how bad war can be. Congratulations to those two gentlemen. I am guessing the member for Eden-Monaro will be speaking on this? </span>

                  </a>  Thank you. In 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip with the intention that Palestinians would be able to set-up a peaceful autonomous region within Israel. The expected flow-on effects of this were that it would lead to further withdrawal from the West Bank. Instead, the Palestinians retaliated with rocket and mortar fire, and the situation was further exacerbated when Hamas took over the Gaza Strip after a coup in 2007. Ten years on, Palestine has sought to use international organisations such as the United Nations to put pressure on Israel and to gain recognition of their state from as many government and non-governmental bodies as possible. In doing so, Palestine has avoided the need to compromise in the path to long-term and genuine peace whilst continuing to voice claims against Israel, particularly the claim to the right of return. As the member for Fadden has noted, this is not a recipe for peace but has continued to cause friction and encourage further conflict. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that, in the preceding 12 months, the General Assembly had adopted 20 resolutions critical of Israel compared to just one in response to the war in Syria, which has resulted in more than 250,000 people killed or driven from their homes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to expand on this for the benefit of the chamber: the world has been shocked by the number of people displaced because of the conflict in Syria and Iraq. The brutality of the Assad regime and the Islamic extremists are an enormous threat to security within the region and to the safety of civilian populations. We have heard of indiscriminate violence, slaughter of innocent and unarmed civilians and continued persecutions of religious groups. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of the world, the decisions of the North Korean military regime are deeply concerning. I encourage all states to consider their paths and move towards a peaceful future, which is what this motion that the member for Fadden has brought to the House is about. I echo the sentiments of the Prime Minister, from earlier this year, in saying that the coalition government will not support one-sided resolutions criticising Israel of the kind recently adopted by the UN Security Council. We deplore the boycott campaigns designed to delegitimise the Jewish state. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions—BDS—movement encourages conflict, allows for the persecution of civilians and is in no way an effective strategy to achieve peace within the region. In an article attacking the BDS campaign, Charles Krauthammer writes:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">And don't tell me this is merely about Zionism. The ruse is transparent. Israel is the world's only Jewish state. To apply to the state of the Jews a double standard that you apply to none other, to judge one people in a way you judge no other, to single out that one people for condemnation and isolation—is to engage in a gross act of discrimination.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I'm proud to be able speak in support of this motion, because it does reflect the unwavering support of both the coalition and Labor for the survival of Israel and its ability to live within secure and peaceful borders and for the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own. The honourable member referred to the centenary of Beersheba coming up. A number of us, from both sides of parliament, will be attending that ceremony. It will be a chance to, once again, highlight the relationship in two world wars between our soldiers and the Jewish community, who carefully looked after them. They provided welfare services, and members of my own family, in both world wars, benefited greatly from that. And it helped inform the policy of the Labor government, post-Second World War, to be a midwife to the creation of the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Creating the two-state solution requires being open-minded and keeping open eyes about the issues involved here. We have to acknowledge the issues and the impediments to achieving that outcome that exist on the Palestinian side. When I had the Middle East desk in strategy group, when I was still in the Army, I convinced the Howard government to send an Australian Army officer over to the Palestinian Authority to help build its security sector, as part of US General Ward's team. That was coming along reasonably well, until the 2006 elections when Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip. In 2007, as was mentioned, Hamas totally ousted any democratic form of institution that we were working on there or that existed, and we had to end that relationship because of our problems with Hamas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This really highlights what is at the heart of those impediments. No democratic government in the Western world should have any business supporting an entity like Hamas, who routinely execute gay and lesbian men and women by throwing them off buildings, who have not had an election since 2006—in fact, we're 11 years into the four-year term of Mahmoud Abbas at the present time—and who repress free trade unions, routinely execute opponents and really oppress women in the Gaza Strip. No woman in Australia would have a good time living in the Gaza Strip as it exists at the present time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have widespread corruption in the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which is really corrosive and undermining of their ability to set up governance institutions. So, when we talk about whether or not we should recognise a Palestinian state, we should understand that, under international law, their ability to do that does not exist at the present time because of the division between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. There's no ability for them to enter into international agreements that will be binding on the territories. Obviously, we need to have fresh elections. We need to maintain leverage in affording recognition to ensure that those key areas that we have grievances with over their human rights abuses should be addressed. These are genuine and real impediments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there could have been a Palestinian state if the Arab leadership of the region had accepted the Partition Plan in 1947, all the way through to 1967. After 1967 it would have been possible had the surrounding neighbours accepted Israel's offer to hand back the territories, but, of course, the famous three noes—no peace, no recognition, no negotiation—were issued. There could have been a Palestinian state, as the member for Fadden highlighted, had there been acceptance of the offers on the table by Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert and, as has come to light most recently, by Senator John Kerry even.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it has been the Palestinian leadership that has really done a disservice to the long-suffering Palestinian people. Our efforts should be directed at helping to build their capability to become a state, to overcome these impediments and to govern and to overcome their human rights issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also fully endorse the Labor Party and coalition stance against the BDS campaign. It is, essentially, an anti-Semitic campaign. It carries dark resonance of the thirties, when they were out there daubing stars of David on business shopfront windows and the numerus clausus era in the universities of the age, when the number of Jews was limited or Jews were excluded from university education altogether. Universities, of all places, should be places where open and free debate should be conducted. It's been quite disgusting how many activities have been conducted to prevent free speech and to prevent the engagement, discussion and dialogue that should be essential to moving the peace process in the Middle East forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge support for this motion. I urge support for the state of Israel in its ongoing battle against the forces of evil and terrorism. We're engaged in the very same struggle. We are locked in those same trenches with our friends of Israel. We need also to advance the cause of peace.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  To resume my speech: with respect to the state-by-state modelling for unmet demand, I understand that my colleague Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore has sought the production of the documents. It is quite unacceptable for this parliament to be expected to vote on such reforms when such critical information is not available. However, the evidence before us does tell us that there is possibly a more meaningful way to address addiction. Experts also tell us that income management as a first step when a person reports that they need help would drive away participants and recipients from self-reporting. In turn, this will make it more difficult to do what I believe the government does want to do—that is, better assist every person receiving the jobseeker payment to be free of addiction and to be job ready.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 no longer provides for drug or alcohol addiction as a reasonable excuse. This can only be a reasonable excuse if we accept that drug or alcohol addiction is a barrier to employment, and then ensure that we provide the pathways to rehabilitation for the participant. As I have previously said, it is reasonable to expect a jobseeker to look for work or to take steps to address the barriers that stop jobseekers participating in looking for work or employment activities. Equally, we as a society must provide as many supports and pathways as possible to assist people to beat their addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 15 provides for targeted compliance. I accept that we should place expectations on jobseekers to be activated and engaged. I do believe, though, that the compliance framework should include income management as a last resort after all demerit points have been exhausted and before the cutting of payments. There is a fine balance with mutual obligations, and I would like to see debate to consider what recipients' further chances should be before payments are removed, as this would cause detrimental financial impact and possibly adverse or unintended consequences, such as a person turning to crime as they see no other option. I think we must look at this legislation and at these clauses from the point of view not just of the individual recipient but of families, and many of these recipients do have families. As this clause stands, ultimately we could possibly be depriving children of food in the cupboard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I cannot support this bill in its entirety as it currently stands. I and my colleagues will continue discussions with the government in good faith, and my Senate colleagues will examine this bill in greater detail. We all want every Australian jobseeker to have every opportunity to address barriers, find employment and achieve happiness and prosperity. This goal is not beyond being realised.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 implements a range of complex measures across the portfolios of Social Services, Employment and Human Services. Labor is committed to ensuring that the proposed measures are in the best interests of supporting and empowering Australians, not demonising and isolating them. We believe in fairness, we believe in equality and we believe in justice. Many of the measures proposed in this bill certainly do not promote these principles. In fact, many of the measures in this bill will deliver the exact opposite for Australian jobseekers and people suffering with drug and alcohol dependency. We note that there are measures we could potentially support if they were separated from other measures in the bill, and we will move amendments in the Senate to do just that. That's exactly why Labor referred this bill to a Senate inquiry—to ensure that it's scrutinised and to ensure that all relevant information on the proposed measures is available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, unfortunately, the government has rushed this process through. It has only allowed a short Senate inquiry into the proposed changes and has scheduled the bill for debate in the Senate on the day that the report is released. That's just not good enough. The government wants to shield these proposed changes from the scrutiny of not just the Labor Party but experts in the field being affected by them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak to several schedules in the bill. Schedule 3 concerns the cessation of the wife pension. The wife pension is a non-activity-tested payment. It's been closed to new applicants since 1 July 1995. It's paid to female partners of age pension or disability support pension recipients who are not eligible for pensions in their own right. The wife pension was granted to women solely on the basis of their partner's eligibility for the age pension or disability support pension. As at 2020, it's estimated that there will be around 7,750 wife pension recipients. According to this bill, of these, 2,250 will transfer onto the age pension and around 2,400 onto the carers payment. These women will be no worse off under schedule 3 of this bill. However, 2,900 women will be transferred onto the jobseeker payment. These will be women below pension age who do not meet the activity test for the carer payment. Transitional payments would apply that mean that they will continue to receive the pension rate of payment rather than the lower jobseeker payment rate, but its indexation would cease, meaning that they would be worse off in real terms over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's estimated that around 200 wife pension recipients who reside overseas will no longer be eligible for any social security payment as a result of this measure. These recipients are under age-pension age and would not be eligible for either another payment under an international agreement or a portable payment. So, in actuality, this means that these 200 or so women will up to be $670 worse off per fortnight. The group of low-income women who will be transferred onto the jobseeker payment will suddenly be left with nothing to live on—including the 200 women who are recipients of the wife pension and reside overseas—other than their partner's pension, and they probably have been out of the workforce for many years. It would seem reasonable for this group to be grandfathered to avoid them facing financial crisis, particularly given their small number and, therefore, the minimum cost of doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 9 of this bill proposes changes to the activity tests for persons aged 55 to 59. It removes the ability of Newstart recipients and some special benefits recipients between the ages of 55 and 59 to fulfil the activity test by volunteering for 30 hours per fortnight. The overwhelming evidence provided by experts to the Senate inquiry considering this legislation was that mature jobseekers actually face significant adversity, including ageism, when trying to enter the workforce. The proposal seeks to adjust the obligations of the 55-to-59-year-old cohort by forcing them to enter the workforce, but in actual fact the government hasn't provided any additional support to help them overcome the significant barriers they face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Experts in the volunteering sector are particularly concerned that the changes may reduce the number of people volunteering in Australia. As somebody who works very closely with community organisations and not-for-profit organisations in my electorate, I understand that they rely very strongly on volunteers, and any kind of negative impact on the volunteering sector is also going to negatively impact those organisations that are providing vital services to people within my electorate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also note that the participation and unemployment rate for the 55-to-59-year-old cohort is similar to the population overall but, once out of work, the length of time a person aged 55 to 59 spends looking for work is 73 weeks, compared to averages of 40 and 50 weeks for those of different age groups. A while ago I held a jobs forum in my electorate, and that was overwhelmingly attended by people within that cohort—people over the age of 50 who are unemployed. I was quite astounded to know that these people don't need more training. They aren't unemployed because of a lack of skills or because of a lack of education. In fact, some of them have PhDs and some of them have engineering qualifications, apart from 20 to 30 years of experience in the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has announced a new program targeted at helping people over 50 back into the workforce called the Career Transition Assistance Program, due to be rolled out in 2020. What I'd like to say about that is that it really doesn't recognise those barriers that our older and mature workers face. Those barriers aren't about their level of skill and they aren't about their level of education. As I've said, many of them have a high level of skill and many years of experience in the Australian workforce, and many of them have education qualifications. In fact, one gentleman who attended my jobs forum has an engineering degree and 20 years of experience in the engineering sector. But, because he's over the age of 55, he's been unemployed for five years and is finding it very difficult to get back into employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They don't need retraining. Our older Australians and our mature workforce don't need retraining. What they need is a substantive change in the system to recognise and value the skills, the experience and the education that older and mature workers bring to a workplace. I would suggest that it might be more worthwhile to promote mature workers in workplaces and to incorporate some substantive measures that address the level of ageism that is occurring in our workplaces, because it is those kinds of systemic and substantive barriers that older workers and mature workers, at least in my electorate, are facing. It's not a matter of their not having any skills. It's not a matter of their needing more training. It is a matter of their skills, their experience and their education being undervalued by the employment market, and I think that's where we need to focus our efforts in that space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to move on now to schedule 12 of the proposed bill. The fact is that the government really hasn't provided any evidence to support the establishment of its drug-testing trial. In fact, evidence from overseas actually goes against what the government is proposing. In New Zealand, for example, a drug-testing program for welfare recipients was introduced in 2013. In 2015, only 22 of 8,001 participants returned a positive result for illicit drug use. The detection rate was much lower than that for the general population of New Zealand estimated to be using illicit drugs. So, if there is no evidence for this proposal, what information is available to show that it will work? We simply don't know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government hasn't told us what the cost to the taxpayer of this testing will be, nor what kind of test it will be. Addiction medicine specialists are concerned about the technical aspects of this particular trial, and still no information has been forthcoming. A long-term cannabis user who is trying to address their drug use will still test positive up to six weeks after their last use. But this doesn't tell us if they are using currently. So how can this test, a test that we have no details about, tell us if a person has actually stopped using drugs, if the drugs are still detected in their system six weeks after they've stopped? These are the kinds of concerns that we are raising but that seem to be swept under the carpet by the government. The government wants to pass this bill without asking the substantial questions about exactly how this part of the bill—exactly how this proposed drug trial—is going to operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medical professionals and the drug and alcohol treatment sector have also raised significant concerns about these measures and their impact on the community. These organisations include St Vincent's Health Australia, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, ACOSS and UnitingCare. In fact, no health or community organisations have actually come out publicly in support of the trial. On top of this, the government is claiming that the availability of treatment will be a criterion for selecting trial sites. The Senate estimates revealed that the Commonwealth doesn't actually have access to data on the availability of treatment and has to rely on the states to provide this information. So, again, there is a lot of confusion about how this is actually going to work and, again, no evidence that treatment places will actually be available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The treatment sector tells us that there are long waiting lists for treatment all around the country. At a meeting in Perth about two months ago, the treatment sector said exactly the same thing: huge, long waiting lists for people who are looking for help with their drug addictions and for beds within drug treatment facilities. The trials that are being proposed by a government whipping up a policy on the run will just increase pressure on an already overburdened system. There is no plan for people who are identified as having an actual drug problem and who can't access treatment because it is not available. So what do we do? We identify that somebody has a drug problem, but then there is nowhere to put them because the drug treatment facilities are already overburdened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we see a government that is wanting to pass a bill without the support of the organisations and specialists who know best and without giving us any information on how it will work. We can't simply continue to ignore the advice of experts in the field. The advice that comes from those working at the grassroots—those who are working with people who are drug addicted—is telling us that this drug trial is simply not going to work. In fact, it will have adverse effects on those people who are trying to rehabilitate and discontinue their drug use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know that the kinds of punitive measures like those being proposed do not stop illicit drug use. You cannot stop drug use simply by incorporating a range of punitive measures or by punishing those who are caught up in this illness. Testing like this can actually lead to people simply using less-traceable but more-harmful drugs like, for example, synthetic cannabis. It can also encourage people to turn to other drugs that aren't being tested for as part of the trial, such as alcohol. What we can see is that the proposed measures do not promote fairness or justice or compassion for jobseekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />I know that receiving welfare and looking for work is stressful and difficult enough as it is. I've been there. I know what it's like and I've lived through it. It's not something that a lot of people are proud of. A lot of people find it quite humiliating. These measures will potentially make it harder for those jobseekers to provide for their families and break out of cycles of poverty and drug abuse. They will not help or support jobseekers with drug use issues. They will just punish them and make it harder for them to address those issues. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IJ4" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SNOWDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  I thank the previous speaker for her contribution and all those participating from this side of the chamber. I have to say that I'm a bit bemused by the fact that there's been such a drop-off of government members speaking on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. So few of them have actually participated, which raises a number of questions, I would have thought, about the belief that exists within the government ranks about some of the measures incorporated in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, this bill seeks to amend a range of quite complex measures across social services, employment and human services portfolios. As usual, I'm indebted to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> from the Parliamentary Library and the work they've done on this legislation. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> tells us, schedule 12 amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to enable the government to run drug-testing trials in three locations. From 1 January 2018, 5,000 new recipients of unemployment payments will be asked, under this legislation, to take drug tests as part of a trial to take place in three locations across the country. People who refuse to take the tests may face penalties. People who test positive on the first test will be placed on income management. If they test positive on later tests, they may be asked to accept drug treatment as part of their mutual obligation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government argues that the drug-testing trials have two objectives: to maintain the integrity of, and public confidence in, the social security system and to provide new pathways for identifying recipients with drug abuse problems and facilitating their referral to appropriate treatment facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, that's not the full story. As again I'm reminded by the work being done by the Parliamentary Library, there are a number of issues that may be of concern. Firstly, the government did not consult with outside experts or service providers while developing the policy. I will come to that in more detail in a moment, because, as we're reminded by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span>, few welfare agencies, health professionals or drug treatment experts regard a combination of random drug-testing and penalties for refusal to undertake treatment as a promising approach. Indeed, I will explain in detail the concerns of these organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, a number of policy experts and commentators have suggested that drug-testing measures are more about signalling the government's disapproval of drug use than they are about assisting the problem drug users into employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, if the cashless debit card or a similar card that is distinctive and readily identifiable is used to income-manage recipients who test positive on a drug test, that may lead to a stigma because it identifies cardholders as drug users. So they are stigmatised and indeed victimised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the availability of drug and alcohol treatment is in the context of national undersupply. Fifthly, and lastly, the Department of Human Services will engage contractors to administer drug tests and determine that a person should be subject to income management. That raises some very serious concerns, and that is why Labor has moved an amendment which will seek for the House to decline to give the bill a second reading. As we argue, it's a cynical attempt by this government to distract from its political problems—that we know about. And it calls on the government to drop their costly and unproven social security recipients drug-testing trial that medical experts say won't work, to listen to medical and health experts by implementing proven ways to assist people by investing in treatment and rehabilitation services to battle drug addiction, and to stop demonising vulnerable Australians who rely on our social security system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We expect a lot from our government, but what we want them to do that is most important is to look after the most marginalised, disenfranchised and, ultimately, victimised people in our community. This piece of legislation is doing precisely the opposite. We expect leadership from the Prime Minister. He says this legislation is an act of love. I say to the Prime Minister it's a very poor act of love. It's a very strange definition of what love is, as my comrade reminds me, if you're seeking to victimise and stigmatise people, because that is the outcome of this legislation on the people this aims to recruit into this drug trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important that the Prime Minister comes into this place as the leader. He is the Prime Minister of the country. He should be using his position for all Australians, not just for some Australians, and what he is doing here is penalising some of the most disadvantaged, marginalised people in this country. He has no problem, as we saw last weekend, attacking the Leader of the Opposition in the most puerile way—in a very childish and schoolboy manner. Yet he can't bring himself to look after the interests of these Australians who, as we're being told by people who know this business, will be victimised, will be demonised and will be stigmatised by this approach. You can't have it both ways in this country. You either govern for all Australians or you don't. In this case the Prime Minister and the government have made it very clear to all who care to listen and watch that they are not interested in properly governing in the interests of all Australians regardless of who they are or where they live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a bit over this Prime Minister, to be very frank, because on the weekend he was in Darwin for a whole of an hour. A whole hour he was in Darwin, attending the local Country Liberal Party conference. We know he's got huge problems, but what was his major message from this meeting of the luminaries of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory? A reminder: he was there for an hour. It was basically to attack the people of the Northern Territory for saying they were concerned about fracking. That's what his message was. He was telling the Northern Territory government that they should overlook the interests, needs, demands and desires of the people of the Northern Territory and just get on with it. Again we're seeing a Prime Minister who clearly has a tin ear. He can't listen, doesn't understand and won't watch and learn from what people who live in regional or remote Australia in this instance think, want and need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no surprise to me that the Prime Minister has adopted this course. But I have to say to him: why doesn't he just look at the evidence and listen to what people who are involved in looking after people who are marginalised in our community say about this legislation. I want to point to a particular submission which was made to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 by a Western Australian organisation—a very good organisation, an organisation that I have a lot of confidence in. It is the Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We contend that the proposed changes outlined within the above schedules, will not result in any significant decrease in alcohol and other drug use by those on welfare, or result in any significant savings by the Commonwealth Government—the intended aim of the Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this is about. This is not about looking after the interests of Australians; this is about cost-cutting and getting savings for the government. If they were fair dinkum, they would look at the views that have been expressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia, who say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The proposals lack an evidence-based approach to welfare reform—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that's clear—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The proposals do not provide a culturally-safe and appropriate service model—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that's also clear—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The proposals are not in line with the National Drug Strategy, and various other Commonwealth and State alcohol and other drug strategies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think, would you not, Deputy Speaker, that if you were going to administer this sort of approach on drug use or the abuse of drugs, you would actually go to the drug strategy that this government is actually proselytising. But no, that's irrelevant to this approach. This Prime Minister, who ought to know better and who parades himself around as a true Liberal, instead of listening to the concerns of people who know, closes his mind, with a very blinkered approach pushed, no doubt, by those on the right-wing rump of the Liberal Party and the Nationals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia go on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The proposals are effectively punitive responses that do little to address what is essentially a health-related issue—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">which it is. Drug abuse, misuse of drugs and alcohol abuse are largely health-related issues. Alcohol and other drug dependency, as they say in their submission, is a health issue that 'requires primarily a health-focused response to address the needs of those people with complex needs'. Therefore, you would think that if the government accepted that proposition—which they clearly don't—they would adhere to the direction and investment in the strategies outlined in their own National Drug Strategy 2017-26. Not this government. They can say one thing on one day and another thing on another day, depending on who the audience is or what their purpose is. This Prime Minister and his government have shown yet again how duplicitous they really are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also—these proposals in this submission pick this up—the government do not outline the provision of any extra investment to voluntary support and treatment services for people with drug and alcohol dependency, who in this case are Aboriginal people. The bill has not been involved with and is not inclusive of community consultation. What we need, as this document points out, is 'further investment in culturally appropriate, evidence-based and ideally community-led, early intervention and prevention services'. That is true. That's what we need. If we've got a concern about alcohol and drug abuse, that's what we need to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, you've only got to look at the propositions being put by so many others. This government ought to—but they clearly don't want to—listen to the propositions which have been put to them. For example, the president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Alex Wodak, has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The drug treatment system in Australia is overloaded and underfunded. Unless that crisis is addressed, these people will go to the back of an already long queue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

I don't have a problem with the Prime Minister drinking—none at all—just as I don't have a problem with the member for Warringah having a drink now and then, yet the member for Warringah has admitted that he got so stonkered that he couldn't even come in to vote on important legislation.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HW9" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHAMPION</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wakefield</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  It would seem that the government has lost interest in its own legislation. It has run out of speakers on its side of parliament. There is a very long list of Labor speakers because we're very concerned about this bill and this welfare 'reform'—and I say 'reform' because really this bill is full of, firstly, malice and, secondly, ignorance. This bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017, has been done for blatantly political purposes. You can see the conduct of the minister: he's been out there, often peddling the sorts of welfare-bashing headlines that we see in tabloids from time to time, with misleading information given about whole communities. Most recently, there was one in my community where a whole suburb was blackguarded on the basis of 80-odd people not showing up for interviews. So a suburb full of people—a suburb and an area with, literally, thousands of people—was blackguarded on the basis of the few who perhaps didn't show up for interviews for one reason or another. So we know that this government comes to this bill and to this parliament in this area not in a spirit of practical improvement or of trying to design a social security system which provides people with income support between jobs and endeavours to give them help as they seek work; instead, it really does bash them around the ears and adopts a sort of pernicious approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three areas of this bill where the government's approach will be very, very damaging to their political processes. It's not just that it's wrong—and we know it's wrong—but that it will actually damage them politically, and I think they should think twice about the nature of the politics about this. The first area is schedule 9, about mature-aged workers. My experience with mature-aged workers, in my area, is that often they left school in year 10 or year 11 or year 12 and went to work in factories. They went to work, day in, day out, for years and years and years. They always rocked up at work and always did the right thing. And then one day their factory was scheduled for closure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I meet people like that all the time. In the middle of the last campaign, I went down to Avery Dennison in my electorate, a little envelope manufacturer—well, it was little; it used to be big, with 400 employees at its height, but it was down to 40 employees during that campaign. And those 40 employees were being made redundant. Those workers, some of whom had started there as they left school and had stayed there for a very long time, did a good job, paid their taxes and did the right thing. Those workers found that when they got made redundant, not only did they not get any help from the social security system, because of the liquid assets test—which the government is further changing in other bills before this House—but that their job prospects were very grim indeed. If you are in your mid-50s, or your early 50s, or even if you're just over 40—if you're my age, 45—your job prospects can be very, very grim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that those people, by any measure, have done the right thing in the contract between citizen and government, if you like: they've worked very hard over a very long period, they've contributed to the system and they've contributed to their communities. Often, what they want is a fair go. Now, at the moment the government says to those workers who might not be able to find work again—and that's the grim reality in some instances—that they can fulfil the activity test, which is the number of jobs applied for per fortnight, by volunteering for 30 hours per fortnight. Frankly, when many mature-age workers apply for work they sometimes send in hundreds and hundreds of applications only to get hundreds and hundreds of rejections. And you get a letter of rejection if you're lucky; often you get no response at all. But volunteering allows them some measure of dignity. They can keep volunteering to fulfil the activity test and to contribute to society, as they've done over decades, and not—I don't want to say 'be harassed' by Centrelink or by the job agencies—be put through the ringer in the same way that, say, a young person is who hasn't contributed to the system and who hasn't paid taxes over decades may be. That's a fair acknowledgement of the situation that many mature-age workers find themselves in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there is age discrimination. We know that the job prospects for these workers can be very grim indeed, even when the labour market is operating well on the macro scale. Often there are regional impacts or individual impacts in terms of their skills. But we know that the work ethic of many of these mature-age workers is really, really good, and that they are often very distraught about not being able to find work. Volunteering gives them a role in the community and in society, and it frees them from the work activity test—which can sometimes be frustratingly cruel, I think, for workers in that situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government should be very, very careful. In regard to mature-age workers, I doubt very much that this bill would ever have been applied in the Howard years. I don't think that John Howard would have put these mature-age workers, who—through a combination of economic change, age discrimination and lack of skill formation—have now found themselves in a very difficult situation indeed, through this. So I think that the government should think again, and that when the Senate inquiry gives them an opportunity to rethink this that they should think about the provisions for mature-age workers very carefully indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area where this bill will impact on my constituents is on jobseekers generally, with the demerit system that would be introduced—ostensibly to avoid people missing interviews and the like. I've had a fair bit to do with this area. Often, I struggle to see the point of the sometimes onerous nature of these compliance systems that we put in place: often they're riddled with error or with human frailty, and often people who are trying to do the right thing get caught out by them. The idea is that we would apply more financial penalties as a result of this new system coming in. At the moment it's projected that the 72,881 financial penalties that are applied every year will rise to 147,000 financial penalties every year. Now, I understand that might sound like a good idea on talkback radio, or when people are bending the arm at the pub. But in reality it diminishes people's capacity to find work and it diminishes their capacity for human dignity, because often the result of those financial penalties is to impoverish them and sometimes to make them homeless. It is an entirely counterproductive thing to apply financial penalties. It doesn't motivate the individual concerned—I can assure you. It often exacerbates the very problems that they face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last provision that Labor has concern with is the drugs tests. I can understand people think, 'This is a terrific idea. If only we quarantine their income, that would yield better results.' We had the BasicsCard. I'm not against it in principle, because we implemented a trial in the city of Playford, which is in my community, and I was an advocate of that trial, but I can tell you from personal experience what we found. What we found worked better were the wraparound service that were put in place at the same time. They were what yielded better results. What yielded better results was actually having Centrelink go out to the community. They went out to places, like the Peachey Belt, and had the Centrelink officers visit the community. Those things yielded better results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government would have more credibility in this area if they hadn't cut a billion dollars out of the flexible funds in health and other areas, which provided the very services that might assist people getting off drugs. We know, from personal experience and from every credible study, that people are addicts. Addiction is a very complex thing and you need to deal with it in a complex fashion. You can't just apply simplistic notions to it. For all the reasons that were given before, we think these drugs tests are (a) waste of money that could go into treatment, and (b) unlikely to yield any positive result. There are plenty of examples from Missouri and New Zealand and all over the world that suggest you catch very few people, and that the result from catching people is often that you could have actually just spent the money on services and done the job there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For all these reasons, we think this bill is a very, very flawed bill. It comes down to the government's intentions in this area. This is a government which is in desperate and dire straits politically, and so it is grasping at the most desperate of territory and the most desperate of proposals to try to fix its political problem. I think, particularly for the mature-age-worker proposals, the government will find that these provisions, when implemented, will infuriate a large group of people in the community who are very good citizens, and who find themselves unemployed through really no fault of their own, as a function of a changing economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the government will rue the day this bill came to parliament and rue the day the minister brought it here, because, once you get past the cheap headlines, what backbench members will find is that they have to face up to these individuals in the community and they have to face up to the results, and the results will not be pretty. This bill, hopefully, will be sensibly amended in the Senate. I hope we can save the government and the community from this minister.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have actually found that in the volunteering role I have had a lot more value in terms of the input that I give into where I've been volunteering in both services. I've actually had an opportunity to also increase my skill set and learn to use different IT systems that I wasn't aware of before. I've also been able to share my knowledge in terms of good customer service skills and looking at customer service models. I've also been able to foster self-esteem in people under Job Network and also with people who are working for the dole. I've been able to be involved in bringing a community together.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm still looking for work. I'm doing that myself anyway. So I think I keep a much more positive approach than what I would have if I wasn't volunteering.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's Sharon Pellas, a witness giving evidence on behalf of Volunteering Australia. Jemma Toohey, the Chief Executive Officer of Albury Wodonga Volunteer Resource Bureau, quoted a volunteer for her organisation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2013 at the age of 59 I commenced volunteering for 15 hours weekly at the Albury Wodonga Volunteer Resource Bureau. Volunteering gave me a sense of pride, in knowing that some of the skills I had acquired from my previous occupations could be useful to this organisation. Volunteering has also given me many personal benefits, such as teaching me some new skills, meeting new people and a sense of wellbeing by giving back to the community. In 2016 I was fortunate to be offered some casual paid working hours which are still ongoing. It is only due to my volunteering that this opportunity arose and I am extremely grateful. Kind regards, Judy Gallagher.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Gallagher's experience is similar to that of many volunteers around Australia aged 50 to 59 who are able to meet participation requirements through volunteering. We know that in Australia we have a challenge in maintaining the strength of community spirit. What the Americans call the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bowling Alone</span> problem and we call the <span style="font-style:italic;">Disconnected</span> problem has meant that Australians now are less likely to donate money, to volunteer their time, to join organisations like Scouts, Guides, Rotary or Lions, to attend a religious service or to be part of a trade union. Social capital is on the wane in Australia, so we need government policies to be looking creatively at how we can encourage volunteering, not discourage it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the last election, Bill Shorten, reflecting Labor's strong commitment to the charity and not-for-profit sector, announced that for the first time there would be a frontbencher with responsibility for charities and not-for-profits, and I am honoured to have that portfolio as part of my responsibilities. Labor takes charities and not-for-profits seriously. Labor stands with charities and not-for-profits in measures that will encourage volunteering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the organisations that have expressed concern about the volunteering measures in this bill are Uniting Communities, ACOSS, Jobs Australia, the National Social Security Rights Network, the Chinese Australian Services Society Limited, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association, the Australian Association of Social Workers, the National Employment Services Association and People with Disability Australia. In their submission to the Senate review of the bill, Volunteering Australia wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For many older Australians, losing employment at this age can be quite difficult, with finding gainful options for employment incredibly difficult. Volunteering can be an effective way to engage in society, acting as a pathway back to employment, and a way to keep people healthy and active.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteering Australia also noted a survey conducted by the Human Rights Commission in 2015, the National Prevalence Survey of Age Discrimination in the Workplace, which found that the highest incidence of age discrimination involved those aged between 55 and 64. The submission quoted from a manager of volunteers in the Barwon region, who referred to closures at Ford and Alcoa 'forcing many folk into early redundancies and unemployment' and went on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I meet many hundreds of potential volunteers each year and a significant number of these individuals are 55 to 59 years of age and above. Invariably, the experience recounted to me is of a demoralising period of job hunting, applying for roles that they are never offered, let alone interviewed for, within a job market so competitive that they rarely if ever receive an acknowledgment for the considerable effort made in each application.</span>

In the case of our Volunteer Manager who works 80 hours a fortnight, we will be forced to shut our Furniture Warehouse if an exemption is not put in place. We accept volunteers according to their skill set … to find full time work and be in this age range with a criminal record makes things near impossible for them.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The submission points out that volunteering brings a range of benefits to jobseekers: the opportunity to gain local knowledge and experience, a supportive environment to build skills, a point of reference for future potential employers, an opportunity to engage socially and enhance wellbeing, and a platform to gain confidence.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Volunteering is the backbone of a robust, safe and engaged community. The benefits that it brings volunteers, organisations and the broader community deserve to be highly regarded and appreciated at all levels of government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Volunteers aged 55-64 are the single biggest cohort of volunteers nationally.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are today in an Australia in which the federal government is continuing to wage war on Australia's charities. From 2011, when the charities commission was established, until just last year, the coalition has been committed to abolishing this one-stop-shop regulator for the charitable sector. Despite having had five ministers responsible for the charities commission over the four years in which it's been in office, the coalition has decided not to renew the contract for Susan Pascoe, the head of the charities commission. She's been there through the tenure of five ministers. She's provided stability to the charities commission through a time of 25 per cent staff turnover every year and considerable uncertainty, and she has received professional awards for her work there. The failure to renew Susan Pascoe's contract ought to be a black mark against Minister Sukkar's name, a minister who has failed to engage with the charities commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The charity sector also feel they have to fight other retrograde measures from this government, such as the war on advocacy. Charities support the right to advocate. They believe that it is important not just as a social service arm but also for environmental, legal and social services charities to be able to talk about big-picture issues and use their on-the-ground experience to inform policy development. Yet we have a government that is attacking charities' right to advocate. We see, through this bill, a further attack on charities by reducing the opportunity of voluntary organisations to satisfy the participation requirement for 55- to 59-year-olds. This will reduce the number of volunteers available to community organisations. Charities shouldn't be fighting the government. Since the Liberals came to office in 2013, the charity sector has had to write two open letters to prime ministers, one in 2013 to Prime Minister Abbott, pleading with him to change his position on scrapping the charities commission, and another—signed by a range of charities, including St John Ambulance, Philanthropy Australia and Volunteering Australia—just this June, calling on the government to take a more constructive attitude to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports charities. We want to work with charities not just to fight against the retrograde attacks from the coalition but to try and improve the regulatory rules around fundraising, to avoid the scandals of the kind that we've seen in Britain following Olive Cooke's suicide and to deal with a patchwork of fundraising laws set up in the pre-internet era. We want to work with charities through our Reconnected forums, of which Labor has now held eight around Australia with a range of my shadow ministerial and parliamentary colleagues. Labor wants to work with charities to garner great ideas to build community life. We're not attacking charities; we're in the business of helping the work of the charity and not-for-profit sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the few minutes remaining, I want to make a couple of remarks about the aspect of this bill which goes to drug testing. I want to begin with the very real story of one of my constituents, who contacted me. She's on the pension, and her 33-year-old daughter, she told me, has been addicted to drugs, mostly methamphetamines, for most of her adult life. Occasionally, the woman told me, her daughter turns to prostitution in order to buy drugs. My constituent said to me, 'If you take away her welfare payment for failing a drug test—because she's been addicted to drugs for the last 15 years—all she'll have to pay for food is my pension.' That's not going to make Australia better off. It's a policy that could increase homelessness and could well increase crime. It's a policy that will make Australia less safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In New Zealand, as Shadow Minister Macklin has pointed out, only 22 of the 8,001 participants who were drug tested in 2015 returned positive results, at a cost of some $1 million. That detection rate—22 out of 8,001—was significantly lower than the drug use rate reported in the general population. As Shadow Minister Macklin has pointed out, the organisations that have expressed serious concern about the government's drug-testing trials include the Australian Medical Association; the Royal Australasian College of Physicians; the Australasian Chapter of Addiction Medicine; the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists; St Vincent's Health Australia; the Rural Doctors Association of Australia; Harm Reduction Australia; the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation; the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre; the Penington Institute; the Kirby Institute, at the University of New South Wales; the Victorian Alcohol &amp; Drug Association; the Australian Council of Social Service; UnitingCare Australia; Homelessness Australia; the St Vincent de Paul Society; the Wayside Chapel; Anglicare; Catholic Social Services Australia; the National Social Security Rights Network; Odyssey House; Jobs Australia; Community Mental Health Australia; the Public Health Association of Australia; and the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Shadow Minister Macklin points out, the extent to which this government has managed to unite the experts in this sector against it is extraordinary. We've had an open letter from 109 addiction specialists, 330 doctors and 208 registered nurses calling on the Prime Minister to stop the drug-testing trial. The Australian Medical Association has described the measure as 'mean and stigmatising'. The Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Existing evidence shows drug testing welfare recipients is not an effective way of identifying those who use drugs and it will not bring about behaviour change.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Had the Turnbull government consulted experts before unveiling this plan, they would have been advised to drop these measures pronto. Drug testing trials for people on income support have been trialled and abandoned in a few countries. In addition to causing significant harm to affected people and the wider community, they came at an enormous cost to the taxpayer. Isn't the government supposed to be reining in wasteful spending?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  We've been debating the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 for three days now, and two days ago the government ran out of speakers. It's such important legislation that for the last two days we haven't seen a government member get up and speak on this particular legislation. Labor members, one after another, have got up and spoken on this legislation, criticising schedule after schedule in this legislation. If it's so important for those opposite, why won't they own it? Why won't you see more of them in this place speaking in support of this legislation? They'll vote for it, but—I'll tell you what—they'll quietly vote for it, because they won't go back to their electorates and advocate for many of the measures in this particular legislation. That's the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a situation where the national accounts were released last week. Mining profits are up and gross profits are up, but guess what? We're in a situation where we've got wages growth at anaemic levels of 1.9 per cent. We've got 730,000 people unemployed in this country, according to the July figures. We have a situation where we've had over 710,000 people unemployed for nine consecutive months in a row. The last time we saw that was in the 1997. And still the legislation we have before this chamber is the priority for the government. We have a situation where the tax-to-GDP ratio has risen under this government. That is, the government is taking more and more revenue from the Australian public: from 21.4 per cent up to 23.7 per cent. Government debt has increased from $273 billion to $501 billion under this government. Labour underutilisation rates have increased as well; more than 1.1 million Australians would like more jobs. Many of them would be dealt with in this legislation today: the 55- to 59-year-olds. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I cannot understand is the fact that this government is actually in one of the schedules getting rid of the bereavement allowance. Without the bereavement allowance, which helps vulnerable people after the death of a partner, they will be $1,300 worse off. I bet those opposite won't put that in their newsletters that go to constituents. I guarantee they will not tell their constituents that, for example, if you're a pregnant and you've lost your partner, for 14 weeks you won't get any support whatsoever in terms of the bereavement allowance. It's gone if this legislation gets through. I guarantee they will not be talking about that at their listening posts or mobile offices. And they won't be telling the 200 wife pension recipients that they're going to lose their support. They won't be telling the 2,900 women who will be transferred onto jobseeker payments that their indexation will cease and they'll be worse off in real terms over time. I guarantee they won't be telling them that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about those 55- to 59-year-olds who are currently making tremendous contributions by volunteering in wonderful organisations around the country? In fact, last Friday night in my electorate I was at the child safety protection awards, where two wonderful local organisations were there and many people were honoured. There were a number of police officers and school principals, but also present were Mission Australia and the Ipswich Community Youth Service, who do fantastic work in terms of child protection and assisting young people and older people with disability with employment services as well. They are fantastic organisations who do wonderful work in the local community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 9 will remove the ability of Newstart and some special benefit recipients between 55 and 59 to fulfil the activity test by volunteering for 30 hours per week. Fifteen of those 30 hours now will have to be paid work. We have a problem with volunteerism in this country at the moment. The previous speaker, the member for Fenner, wrote a tremendous book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Disconnected</span>. He worked previously on <span style="font-style:italic;">Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">American Community</span>, which was a great examination of the drop-off in social inclusion and volunteerism in the United States of America.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wonderful organisations such as the Scouts, brigades, P&amp;Cs, trade unions, chambers of commerce, sporting clubs, RSLs et cetera have a decline in contributions and the number of people attending and being involved in these organisations. The member for Fenner wrote a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Disconnected</span>, and I commend people to read that particular book. I'm not advocating for his sales, by the way; I'm not trying to enrich him. It's a great contribution that he's made to public life by writing that book. He points out that we have seen that in Australia as well. Organisations are dropping off. As a federal member, I know you only have to go around to many organisations to see the fact that there are many people of what my grandmother would call 'the older generation' when she was alive. Everald Compton, the great advocate who stalks these corridors, calls them the oldies. He is a former head of National Seniors Australia. He does that sort of thing, but he's a great contributor to community life as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of these people face terrible age discrimination because they've lost their jobs. In my community right now, some of these people are facing the challenge of losing their jobs. We are losing 900 jobs in the Ipswich and West Moreton region, from the Churchill Abattoir and facility there owned and run by Woolworths to the Steggle's chicken processing plant out there in the Wulkuraka region. There have been people who've come to or contacted my office and people whom I've spoken to personally. I've spoken to the meat workers union—the AMIEU—and the metalworkers union, who are both working with these people, and there is a great all-of-government and community response to these. But some of these are older workers will be facing the challenges that in this legislation currently before us today. I want to thank the government, in a bipartisan way, and Minister Tudge, for the fact that Centrelink and the Australian government Department of Employment will be helping out. I want to thank Regional Development Australia for the help they are providing. I also want to thank Ipswich City Council, and I want to pay particular credit to Alan Brown, the business liaison officer, and also the Queensland state government. I've been dealing closely with the member for Ipswich, Jennifer Howard, and the state member for Ipswich West, Jim Madden. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a big challenge we are facing in our community, but some of the workers who are going to be subject to this legislation, including one who was in my office fairly recently, are in this age bracket. The government has said that this is part of its broader, stronger participation provisions but those workers will face big challenges, and I want those workers in Ipswich to know that we are with them all the way. We will help wherever we can, and my office will always be available. If they need help with Centrelink payments or assistance to make applications, we will be there to help them and, if they are interested in contacting us, I am happy to talk with them about the challenges they face. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there was a Senate inquiry into this legislation. Many of the community organisations that I referred to before, such as Mission Australia and Ipswich Community Youth Service, are part of organisations such as Volunteering Australia. Volunteering is a tower of strength. We know how important it is. It touches every section of our economy and every section of our community: sport, recreation, art, heritage and emergency services. It's so important. The role of volunteer support services is about empowering local communities and about being there in times of need. I have seen this in times of terrible floods in 2010-11 and in 2013 in Ipswich and Somerset. Sadly, Volunteering Australia records show that, for the first time in 20 years, the number of people formally volunteering in Australia in 2014 has reportedly declined to 31 per cent, down from 36 per cent in 2012. So volunteerism is under challenge. But what is happening here? Volunteering Australia made a submission to the Senate inquiry into this legislation before the chamber. What they said about tightening the activity test was that it will have a profound impact on the volunteering sector. I will quote from the submission. The truth of the matter is that many people fulfil their activity contribution by volunteering. That's laudable and wonderful. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They call this particular aspect of the bill 'short-sighted' and lacking in understanding of the pervasive age discrimination that this group experiences every day. We saw that when I was the shadow minister for ageing in the Labor opposition in the last term of parliament. We saw great age discrimination campaigns undertaken but, sadly, people in this age bracket do face age discrimination. </span>

The report found that older people experience greater levels of discrimination in workplaces when applying for jobs. That's backed up by a survey conducted by the commission in 2015 revealing that those who had reported experiencing age discrimination gave up looking for work entirely. Indeed, Volunteering Australia, whom I've met here in Canberra to talk about this issue, have said that people more likely to give up volunteering as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the wonderful community organisations in my electorate and to the volunteers who are involved with them—the SES, Emergency Management and a whole range of others. We honour them every year. I want to praise Cityhope Church in Ripley in my electorate that has a day of honour for volunteers who make such a great contribution. When I look around the room when I speak at that particular church service every year—I commend pastor Mark Edwards and his congregation for what they do; hundreds of people were there from all corners of the electorate and beyond—there are many older Australians there who contribute, and I pay tribute to what they do. I was struck by that recently when the <span style="font-style:italic;">The Queensland</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Times</span> did a photograph of me with Mark. The people who contribute whether in the local ambulance, the rural fire brigades or the SES were lined up there in their orange or blue uniforms. The contributions of older Australians make such a difference. The fact is that this particular legislation will be harmful to the contribution that volunteers make in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another aspect of this particular whole thing that the government is undertaking. That was mentioned by the shadow minister for employment, the member for Chifley, and that is, the Career Transition Assistance program, which is part of the suite of employment participation that's referred to in this legislation. My electorate and the Somerset regional part of it is being picked up as one of the trial sites from 1 July 2018, ahead of a national rollout in 2020. I am deeply sceptical about this, because this is a situation where the government spends $9 billion annually on employment projects. There are about 40,000 employment service consultants in this country. With the sorts of things that employment consultants should be doing themselves, in my view, things like skills audit, training requirements and helping people to market themselves to employers, I can't understand why the government is spending $98 million on this particular aspect. What they should do is have a really good look at the job services network. I don't believe it's working anywhere near as well as it should. We've got a takeover of about 35 per cent of wage subsidies. About one in five people over 26 who get jobs in these areas are actually still in employment after 26 weeks. The government should do a lot better and a lot more. We know they have cut $3.5 billion out of skills and training in this country. We've got 148,000 fewer apprentices than when this government came to power about four years ago. They are simply not doing enough and they are not doing it well across this space. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final two minutes, I will talk about the establishment of the trial of drug testing for jobseekers. It's been trialled just down the road from my electorate, in Logan, in the member for Rankin's electorate. Logan is very much like Ipswich. I feel for the people of Logan. I note the mayor of Logan, Luke Smith—who is not always a great supporter of the Labor Party, I might add, but I have a particular respect for him—pointed out that there was no consultation in the fact that they were imposing this on the people of Logan. He called the lack of consultation and the top-down approach 'a disgrace'. He was amazed by it. This won't work. This simply will not work. It's not about love, as the Prime Minister talked about. It's about punishment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall a number of discussions I had when I was the forerunner to—we now call them hospital boards in Queensland—the Ipswich and West Moreton Hospital and Health Service council. We had a number of presentations to ask about what was happening in Ipswich and discussions about what was happening with the health plaza where people get ATODs assistance. But the advice that we got from experts—and this government doesn't seem to want to listen to experts very often—is that this type of approach doesn't and won't work. My colleagues have repeatedly outlined where it's failed overseas. I won't repeat what they have said, but I am deeply sceptical of what this government is doing. This is about demonising people. It's not about supporting them. If they were about supporting them, then they would have correspondingly a huge increase in drug and alcohol rehabilitation. They haven't, so my scepticism is very well-founded. I oppose the legislation and support the amendment by the member for Jagajaga.</span>

                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  There are a range of measures that are proposed in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. I only intend to speak on one of them—the issue of drug testing welfare recipients and the implications from that that certain penalties will be imposed in respect of these recipients. I also would like to say, if time permits, a few words about the things that aren't in the bill but absolutely should be if the government was truly focused on the challenge of welfare reform. I am absolutely certain that there is not a member in this place whose offices are not inundated on a daily basis by citizens who are trying to get their benefits processed by Centrelink and yet they are faced with delays. I am not talking about days; I am not talking about weeks; I am talking about months and months and months of delays. These are pensioners seeking to get access to a pension benefit. These are carers seeking to look after a loved one who cannot look after themselves and to access a benefit they are entitled to. The government has cut in excess of 1,200 jobs, frontline positions, and forced hundreds and hundreds of other jobs in Centrelink into casual working arrangements. Is it any wonder that there are constant delays and constant mistakes. I make no criticism of the hardworking staff of Centrelink. I make enormous criticism of the minister, who seems either ignorant or unwilling to do anything about it. And it is the citizens of our electorates who are paying the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I say more about that, can I talk about the drug-testing initiative. If ever there was a policy that was all about press release and not about outcome, it is this one. This is, indeed, a press release in search of an evidence base, in search of a policy prescription; it is entirely without substance. Many of my colleagues have spoken about the fact that similar measures introduced overseas have not worked; they have cost the taxpayers of other jurisdictions millions and millions of dollars with no perceivable benefit to either the individuals or the taxpayers as a whole. I will not go through that evidence because others have put it on the record. But I would like to have a look at the supposed objective of this measure. If the objective of the measure is to reduce the incidence of substance abuse in this community, there is not a member of this place who would not agree with it. There is not a member of this place who would not say we would be a much better country if we were able to reduce the incidence of substance abuse in our community. And I am not just talking about illicit drugs; I am talking about alcohol abuse as well. We know that the No. 1 drug of concern to people in the front line of substance abuse and rehabilitation is alcohol. There are problems with all the other illicit drugs but alcohol is the No. 1 drug of concern. It is present in just about all of the presentations that they see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might surprise people to know that Australia currently spends somewhere in excess of $1.7 billion combating illicit drugs. This, of course, includes police detection and arrest for drug crimes. It includes policing the borders of Australia for importation and prevention programs. It includes treatment programs and harm reduction strategies as well. If this bill before the House succeeds, it will be adding more to that annual bill and what we are spending on drug detection and prevention and combating illicit drugs. We do have to ask ourselves whether that money is well spent, because the results do not seem to suggest that it is. Of the total pot of $1.7 billion, almost 65 per cent is spent on what is known as supply reduction—basically, law enforcement. The bill before the House could in many respects be seen as an additional element in that—an enforcement activity. Just 22 per cent of that $1.7 billion is spent on treatment, 9.5 per cent is spent on prevention and about 2.2 per cent is spent on harm reduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that hasn't been thought through by the government in relation to this policy is the fact that the treatment services that will be inundated as a result of this government's policy are already strapped. They cannot meet the current demands. The problem is greater in regional electorates like mine. I speak to the treatment centres down my way. There are not enough of them and they do not have the staff and the facilities to deal with the problems they are dealing with. There is already a waiting list in excess of six months for most of these sorts of services—not everywhere; there some exceptions. But on the whole there is already a waiting list of about six months. And for specialist services in NSW alone, there is one, maybe two, specialist services dealing specifically with women with a drug addiction problem—absolutely strapped. And if they are in need of residential care, even fewer places are available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I really do fear that not only has the government not thought through the policy and the resources that are going to be needed just to meet the current demand but whether this is going to have the result of pushing people out of the queue who are currently sticking up their hand and saying: 'I know that I've got a problem with substance abuse and I want to get treatment and turn my life around. I'm sticking my hand up and I want to turn my life around.' That person has willingly presented themselves to a treatment centre only to be told: 'Good on you for taking the first step. We're going to get back to you in months,' not weeks, 'because we don't have the residential services available to us at the moment.' My fear is that these people are going to get pushed back further down the queue because of the results of this ill-thought-through policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it any wonder that the Australian Medical Association, all of the expert drug and alcohol treatment services—through their peak bodies—and just about anybody who knows anything about how this sector works and what is going to work has said that this policy is nuts and is not going to work? A government that was moved by evidence, as opposed to ideology and a government that was moved by evidence and purity of purpose would take heed from the submissions that have been put through the Senate process—the very public submissions that have been made by many of the advocates—and then say: 'This isn't the right way to go. We're going to withdraw this provision from the bill.' They would have our full-bodied support if they were to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I came into parliament I spent a lot of time as a community worker. I worked as a lawyer for many years and in those jobs I had a lot of face-to-face experience with the issues that this bill is purportedly attempting to tackle. It was clear to me then, as it is now, that what we're doing at the moment isn't working and that we need to build our policies on the best available evidence and the best research, not only from Australia but from around the globe, about what is likely to work—particularly when it comes to treatment and how we help people to turn their lives around. We do need to adopt a health based approach, and this bill is anything but that. We need to adopt a health based approach rather than relying on measures which will have the end result of filling our jails with people who have a health problem but which does very, very little to stem the supply of drugs or the harms caused. If those opposite were driven by evidence, not politics, they would direct resources towards the policies which were going to have the best result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few years ago I remember visiting the Solaris Therapeutic Community Program. It's a voluntary treatment initiative for adult males at the Alexander Maconochie Centre. For those who don't know it, it's the jail which is about five kilometres from where we are standing today. I had the opportunity to talk to a group of men who were, obviously, in jail and who were going through the program on a voluntary basis. I was talking to them about their substance abuse problems. I asked each of them: 'How old were you when you first saw your life going off the rails? How old were you when you first started substance abuse, whether it was alcohol or illicit drugs?' There were about 11 or 12 guys there. What struck me was that most of them didn't get to double digits. That is, most of them had not turned 10 before they had their first experience of an illicit drug. If those opposite dug deeper and asked what was going on in the household of that young person and in the lives of those young people—if they bothered to take the time to find out what was going on—they certainly wouldn't present the sort of bill which is before the House today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've visited lots of drug and alcohol treatment centres around the country over the time that I've been in parliament—I visited them in my professional capacity before I was a member of parliament. When you talk to people who are receiving treatment, one of the things you hear that are remarkable is that over 90 per cent of those people will tell you that there was some pre-existence, some underlying trauma, that set them on the path that they are now on, whether it was abuse in the family or the households that they grew up in; whether it was family violence; or whether it was, as is so often the case, that somebody had a horrific injury, took a course of opioids as part of the treatment process for that injury and went from a licit source of opioid use to an illicit source of opioid use. The stories were so common and so repeated as to allow us to draw the conclusion that in the majority of these instances there is an underlying trauma which causes or leads somebody into substance abuse. From that you can also draw the conclusion that, unless you deal with those underlying traumas, those underlying psychological, mental and physical health issues, you aren't going to be able to get to the root cause of the drug addiction and you certainly aren't going to be able to help those people turn their lives around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't have to be a researcher in this area to know that we've got a lot of people in our prisons. I won't say it is the cause of the crime, but for a significant majority of the people in there—I wouldn't say the overwhelming majority, but a significant majority—drugs and alcohol are on board in a significant number of those criminal incidents. It's why people in the sector often refer to prisons as the rehabilitation service of last resort. At $300 a day, it is a very expensive way of dealing with a problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my message, my heartfelt message, to the government today is this: if you are truly committed to doing more than grabbing a headline; if you are truly committed to doing more than making a cheap political point, than playing a populist card; if you are truly committed to doing something about the insidious problem of illicit and other drug abuse in this country; then you won't be introducing measures like the one before us. Instead, you will take the time to talk to the people whose lives have been affected. You will take time to talk to people who are attempting to turn their lives around or who have attempted to turn their lives around and have succeeded. You will take the time to talk to these people. You will invest in the most effective place, which is in treatment and prevention. If you do that then you will ensure that we go a long way towards reducing the problems that we have in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These punitive measures have been tried overseas. We know they don't work. It is of the utmost arrogance for this government to believe that repeating the same mistakes that have been made overseas is going to have a different result in this country. I can support some measures in this bill, but not this one.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  I commend and support the comments of the member for Whitlam in respect of this legislation, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. The government's spin in respect of this bill is that it has been brought to the House as a measure that might help get people's lives back in order. The truth is that this bill is nothing more than a budget savings measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the government's deficit at the end of last year was $37.6 billion, and we know are they heading for another deficit of $30 billion or thereabouts this year—and that's if their figures can be relied on. To date they have proven that they cannot be relied on. We know full well that the net effect of this legislation is for the government to save some $370 million over the forward estimates. Out of that might come some money that they will require in order to pay for the drug-testing provisions that are contained within this bill. We don't know what those amounts are because the government won't tell us. But even when you allow for whatever costs they incur in respect of the drug testing, the fact remains that this is a measure that is going to save the government possibly $100 million a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it is the vulnerable welfare recipients that have been targeted by this government. It has been become a characteristic of the coalition government to target the poor. It started with the Abbott-Hockey government, with their first budget in 2014, which was considered so harsh and so cruel that it was soundly rejected by just about everyone across the country, including most of the members of this parliament. We then had a change of Prime Minister and a change of Treasurer, but the same strategy continued. The same harsh measures continue to be seen in the legislation that comes before this House time and time again. If people's lives were truly the focus of this government's legislation, then the $370 million that will be saved would have been put into other welfare assistance programs that might actually have some real effect of helping those people's lives get back on track, but that is not the case. Were it the case, we might be looking at this legislation with a different perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government revenue measure. Whilst I accept that some of the 18 or 19 measures in this legislation are worth considering, I also know that many of them are indeed harsh and should not be supported. That is particularly the case with the drug-testing trial. I note that that trial has been criticised widely, not just by the usual welfare support groups but, indeed, by health professionals and drug rehabilitation specialists across the board. If the measures were going to help, I am sure that those people who have the most experience in helping people with a drug addiction change their lives would be supporting this measure, but they're not. Indeed, if the government were serious about helping those people, then the first groups they should have asked advice from are the very specialists in the field and the health professionals who have to deal with people who have a drug addiction each and every day. They should have sought advice from them, but it seems they didn't.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will always be people who rort the welfare system, just as there are always people who rort the tax system or any other government initiative out there. That is a reality. Such people will always be found, because if a person has an intent of rorting whatever government system it is that they rort, they will find a way of doing so. We would not oppose any measure that genuinely sought to close down loopholes if they exist. But, again, this legislation is not about closing loopholes; it's simply about making it more difficult for welfare recipients to get the support they need and about denying them the payments they would otherwise receive. Regrettably, this legislation will punish far too many people for whom welfare support is not their choice—those whom, for reasons possibly beyond their control, find themselves in the situation that they are in. In the situation that they are in, they need some kind of welfare support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about welfare support, we are not talking about even the minimum average weekly wage of $694 a week; we are talking, in most cases, of payments of around $268 a week. I wonder how many members opposite could live off that sort of money or have ever had to live off that sort of money. Perhaps if they had to walk in the shoes of the very people they are trying to make decisions about, they might see this legislation for what it is and perhaps they would not be so supportive of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People on welfare payments, in my experience, already feel as if they are being treated in a humiliating way and quite often find so much of their time wasted because of the hoops they have to jump through in order to get the payments that they are entitled to or that the government provides to them. Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I am sure that your office, just like the offices of most MPs in this place, would regularly have people that are seeking welfare support come to you for assistance out of sheer desperation, because they can't seem to navigate the demands that are put on them by the different agencies they have to deal with in order to get some meagre payment. It is a fact of life for most MPs' offices. Regrettably, it seems that MPs' offices have become nothing more than an extension of the Department of Human Services. From my experience in my office, on a regular basis we are trying to help people with their claims.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the employment situation in Australia, the reality is there are some two million people who are either unemployed or underemployed. That means there are simply not enough jobs out there right now for those people who are genuinely looking for work. So even if one was to accept that some people are not trying as hard as they could, the reality is that there are simply not enough jobs out there for them. Even if and when there are jobs, many of the people who have been unemployed for a long time—there are reasons, in most cases, that are beyond their control. The jobs that are out there are perhaps asking for skill levels that people who are unemployed simply don't have, or the jobs may be outside of the region from where these people come from. It may be there are serious transport difficulties for these people in order to get to the jobs available, or they simply don't have any work experience at all. At other times it might even be a case where there are personal family or health circumstances that are totally beyond their control that limit their ability to either travel or commit to a full-time job. At the end of next month, there will be even more people unemployed as a result of the ending of car making in this country, so it will be even more difficult. We are bringing in this legislation at a time when, as the government must surely know, it is going to become increasingly difficult for people to find work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have personally spoken with families and individuals who have been looking for work for months and, in some cases, years. I have no doubt whatsoever that these are genuine people who are looking for work and who are trying their hardest, and the reality is they simply cannot find a job because the jobs are not there. When they have found employment, sometimes it's been in a field totally outside of what they were qualified for or skilled in or they've had to move to a different region, and it's been months or years later. For them, in that intervening time, what were they supposed to do, other than what they have done? And yet we are now saying: 'We want you to do more because, if not, we're going to find ways to cut an additional week of payment to you. We'll find a way of cutting that out.' This legislation is indeed harsh.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak briefly about a couple of the matters within it. When we talk about people being on welfare, again, my experience is that most people who are on welfare payments would prefer not to be on welfare payments. They would prefer to be in paid employment, where they can perhaps achieve and have some of the things they have always aspired to have. I want to refer just briefly to the drug trial proposal in this legislation. As I said earlier: firstly, there is no evidence to support what the government wants to do and, secondly, it has been widely criticised. Again from my experience, and as the member for Whitlam said earlier, most people who are drug addicts would very much prefer not to be. For some it might be their choice, but I suspect that for most it is not a choice they would willingly make, and if they could get off the drugs they would. And yet we see nothing in this legislation that is truly going to assist them get off their drug addiction. That would be the best way to get them back into the workforce, not to say, 'If you don't pass a drug test you will be automatically taken off.' In addition, for those people who are not drug addicts to be called in and told, 'You are going to have to pass a drug test of some sort', it would be humiliating and embarrassing. Again, I believe it is totally uncalled for and unjustified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other matters in this legislation that I briefly want to go to. One of them is the start date and another is the removal of intent to claim, which are both provisions within this legislation. Both of them have the effect of delaying the commencement time for a person to receive any payments. Both of them are miserly ways of cutting payments to them. When you look at the way it is intended to introduce these provisions, it simply says that when you make a claim or contact the office to make a claim, your payment won't start then. Your payment will start later, after you've jumped many other hoops and brought in forms and all the rest of it.</span>

It's being administered by the Hodgman state Liberal government. The road surfacing is a disgrace. It's being torn up and has to be done again. That's because this government is not doing its job properly with funding and with making sure that the state government in Tasmania does its job properly.

There was a shambles of a regional health funding changeover from preventive health to chronic care—an absolute shambles. Even Liberal senators, who usually can't be seen or heard, were crying out about this shambles of a regional health funding changeover and what happened there. There was a petition that I presented to this parliament in the last sitting which had 550 signatures from people across my electorate who said that regional health funding was a shambles and they wanted their services back. There have been unexplained delays in the commencement for a trial site as to youth suicide. It is absolutely disgraceful, the way this government is failing regional Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The area contributes 38 per cent of the total gross value of agricultural commodities produced in the Perth region, including 97 per cent of tomatoes, 92 per cent of avocados and 78 per cent of strawberries. Currently, many fruit and vegetable growers of the region are forced to cease production for part of the year, leaving fields idle, due to reaching their maximum water allocation.</span>

While studies indicate that this is a more costly option than using existing groundwater supplies, it may be an economically viable option for long-term sustainability of the horticultural industry in Wanneroo when the economic impact of distance to market is taken into account. The horticultural industry in Wanneroo is vital to the economy of our region, and I call upon the federal government to urgently address the water security issues for our local growers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor has always fought for the country, and we've always delivered for regional Australia, by investing in health care and schools; by building roads and infrastructure projects; by addressing inequality, a very important move; and by having a fairer tax system—unlike the Nationals, who, shamefully, support tax cuts for multimillionaires and big business. But not Labor: Labor stands up for the country. It's only Labor that delivers for the people of regional and rural Australia, because we have their back, and we will always support them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  On behalf of Labor, I extend my warmest wishes to Coptic communities in Australia and around the world, who are today celebrating the Coptic New Year, Nayrouz. The celebration of Nayrouz is observed according to the ancient Egyptian calendar or Coptic calendar. Nayrouz commemorates the martyrs of the Coptic faith and their sacrifice in protection of the Christian faith in the Roman era. Traditionally, seasonal red dates are eaten on this day. The red symbolises the blood of the martyrs, the white centre of the dates is a symbol of their purity, and the seed reflects their strong faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, Coptic communities mark Nayrouz with a special mass that includes a joyful choir of chants and prayers in remembrance of the lives and examples the martyrs led. Dates are handed out, along with pictures of the holy Coptic saints, to followers at the end of the mass. The word 'Nayrouz' originated from the Coptic word that means 'rivers' and coincides with the annual inundation of the Nile River with water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful for the contributions of our Coptic communities. I acknowledge those in my electorate Punchbowl, as well as the broader Coptic community in Australia and in particular the Coptic member of parliament, the member for Wills. It is celebrations like Nayrouz that highlight our diverse nation of many cultures, faiths and backgrounds, united by our shared values of hope, peace and unity—the essence of what a modern multicultural society stands for. I wish all those celebrating a happy and prosperous Nayrouz.</span>

Last Friday, on 8 September, I was pleased to cut the ribbon at the official opening of the new Boundary Road overpass at Narangba, with the Queensland acting main roads minister. The project was finished under budget and six months ahead of schedule.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in September 2013 I was elected. In January 2014, many businesses contacted me about the inadequate overpass at Boundary Road. I fought with the previous member for Longman, young Wyatt Roy—there he is in this picture with the former Deputy Prime Minister—for 'Boundary Road, just build it'. Well, it has been built. I am very pleased to announce it has been built. It is officially open, and it is going to benefit many residents, in North Lakes, and businesses through increased productivity and less time stuck in traffic. They now have a new six-lane overpass on Boundary Road with longer on-ramps. It's future-proofed, so when the Bruce Highway goes to eight lanes, it will be ready for that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, in and around the Petrie electorate, spent $2 billion on infrastructure, including: the Gateway Upgrade North project; the Moreton Bay Rail Link; the Rothwell roundabout, soon to be finish in late October; and the Black Spot Program funding on Telegraph Road at Bracken Ridge. Deception Bay Road overpass has been funded in this budget, with six lanes all the way Caloundra. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I just remind the ALP that the CFMEU are the biggest financial backers for the ALP in Queensland. They're a coalmining union. I belonged to it for a fair portion of my life and have been a very strong supporter of it all of my life. They are reaching the end of their restraint in this area, and so they should be. The party that's supposed to be the champion for them is out there advocating the abolition of coal.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I am one of the few people in this parliament who actually know a little bit about this industry, because I was the Minister for Mines and Energy in the Queensland government in 1990, and I can say with great pride that, when the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen government fell in 1990, we had the cheapest electricity charges in the world. I don't know whether they call us socialists or whatever the hell they call us, but all I know is that we had a reserved resource policy. We took the coal for free, so Queensland got their electricity from free coal. The free market geniuses—most of them are on the other side, but some are on this side too—free-marketed the industry, and the price shot straight through the roof. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Just before I left for Canberra prior to last week, I attended the inaugural Cannington Cops versus Clontarf College football game down at Curtin University oval, which was AFL. The game was a WA Police engagement initiative aimed at building relationships between police, Indigenous students and families, and the broader community in the South-East Metropolitan police district. They had held one previously with the local Islamic association, but that was a soccer game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was great to see so many community members come down to watch the game and enjoy the free sausage sizzle with friends. I commenced the official proceedings by tossing the coin, and then the game got off to a cracking start. The Clontarf boys opened with a strong first half, leading the Cannington Cops by 35 to nine by half-time, but the Cannington Cops pulled back across the third and fourth quarters and managed to pull off an unexpected win against Clontarf, winning by just eight points, 64 to 56.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank Superintendent Brad Sorrell, Sergeant Matt Sharp and the principal of Clontarf, Troy Hayter, for their efforts in organising this important event. It's a great opportunity to encourage relationships between our local police and their community. It was also great to see so many of the Clontarf boys chatting with the WA Police on how they can actually get into the academy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate both sides on an awesome afternoon of football. I look forward to seeing the next Clontarf versus Cannington Cops challenge next year, with Clontarf coming back stronger in next year's game.</span>

It's not a religion. It's not something that you believe in or don't believe in. It is science, and our farmers are hit harder than anyone else, due to a prevalence of extreme weather events. Yet the Leader of the National Party, which purports to look after regional and rural Australia, refuses to accept the challenges faced by people on the land. His archaic attitudes and rudimentary interpretation of climate science and the solutions leave a heck of a lot to be desired, and they leave our farmers and regional centres very vulnerable.

These statues are part of our history. They are part of our proud heritage. They are nationally significant monuments, and we should not be trying to rewrite history. For, once you start, where do you stop? I agree with Brendan O'Neill, who said of such statue changers:</span>

We need investment to develop the north. We need investment to boost the northern population. We must seek investment if we are to develop our northern economy for the benefit of our whole nation. Together we can activate the north for the good of our nation, but there are some roadblocks to success—for example, this government doing the opposite of its stated aim of decentralisation by moving more than 400 public servants out of the northern capital of Darwin.</span>

Let me give you a hot tip: you do not get to understand the issues facing the north by flying into Darwin for an hour, hanging out with what's left of the CLP and bagging the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is leading policy development in the north—in particular, through slating $1 billion from the NAIF for tourism infrastructure in the north. This is a welcome commitment in an area of our economy that needs more attention. It will also benefit Indigenous Australians across northern Australia. When we talk about the economies of rural and regional Australia, let's not forget about the north. Let's all come down to the Mural Hall on Wednesday afternoon and join in Facing the North, where people can learn more.</span>

The well-known Acton family host this at their property Paradise Lagoons. The campdraft is conducted over four days in this world-class venue. In true outback style, it features the exciting sport of campdrafting and family entertainment and social events for all ages. The four-day program provides dawn-to-dusk edge-of-your-seat competition as riders from all corners of the nation test their skills to take home up to $200,000 in prize money. Ladies flock to the annual ladies lunch, and spectators from all over attend the highly anticipated event State of Origin Campdraft.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to stress the importance of events like this to rural and regional communities. When times are tough, this can bring much-needed relief. It is not just important to our region at the level of community spirit; these events also bring great economic benefits. People from all over Australia travel to our region. Whether they are competitors, family members of competitors or stallholders, all assist in stimulating our economy. This year's event was no exception. I congratulate the organisers for the great work of this July event.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  As people woke today to the news headlines and read the front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> there was a collective rolling of the eyes and a sigh that, yet again, the National Party had demonstrated how out of touch they are. On the weekend, they gathered in Canberra—the party of decentralisation, by the way—to rally against clean energy yet again. They passed a motion completely opposing the clean energy target and subsidies for clean energy. This demonstrates yet again how out of touch they are with their own constituency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Farmers' Federation and Farmers for Climate Action are saying climate change is real and they want to see clean energy and a clean energy target. We know by talking to farmers that this is energy they want. They want the ability to reduce their energy costs on farm. Outside of Newbridge is a solar power plant that is helping to grow mushrooms and halve the energy bills of that farmer. Our farmers want clean wind technology on their properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet again, the Nationals and the Liberal Party have demonstrated how out of touch they are with regional Australia. They refuse to meet with our farmers and listen to what they're saying. Whether it be coalminers in Capricornia or our farmers, these parties only care about what they do in Canberra. They don't stand up for the people of the bush; they don't even meet in the bush when they have their national conferences. This is disgraceful and shameful behaviour by both these parties, who claim to represent the regions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I am very pleased to speak about an important new policy initiative being trialled in my local community, in the Bankstown area. That is the government's new drug-testing trial for welfare recipients. This is a very important policy because the reality is that, if people are on welfare and are addicted to drugs, they will struggle to get a job in the first instance. That's the reality. The second reality is that, if they do get a job, they will struggle to hold it down if they're drug addicted. This policy will test people who are receiving Newstart benefits and, if they are found to be on drugs, they will go onto an income management card for 80 per cent of their benefit. Basically, they will still get the same amount of money, but they will no longer be able to use their welfare payments to buy drugs. That's good for the welfare recipient, and it is also good for taxpayers. Frankly, people in my community do not want to see their tax payments redistributed to drug dealers. They don't want their tax payments to underwrite the lifestyle of drug dealers. That's why this is a very important policy. It's good for the person who is drug addicted because it will help them to get off drugs and it's also very important in demonstrating that taxpayers' money is being protected. Those opposite, shamefully, are opposing this trial. They should support it wholeheartedly, just like my community does.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  For the last few years, the government have wanted to talk about anything except inequality, and we now know why. I'm not talking about their attacks on penalty rates and regional Australia; I'm not talking about their stuffing up of the NBN; I'm not talking about their attacks on the health system. I'm actually talking about the recent analysis of the Community Development Program, where they have been caught red-handed rorting the funds that have been set up for all Australians. We have looked at where they've spent the money and we can tell you that, over the last four years, for every dollar that they have spent in a Labor electorate in New South Wales, they have spent $37 in one of their own electorates. If you look at Queensland, for every dollar that they have spent in a Labor electorate there, $138 has been spent in one of their own electorates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some winners in all of this, I've got to tell you, because over on that side they have this thing called 'bucks for the boys'. If you look at the electorates around the country that have the most money, that struggling electorate of Wentworth, the Prime Minister's own electorate, managed to pull in a grant of over $20 million. That was also the case in North Sydney. Then you have the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate, one of the most awarded electorates in the country, which received $17 million. If this is not bucks for boys, I don't know what is.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  On Saturday, I was pleased to be back in the New South Wales Riverina by the banks of the mighty Murrumbidgee River for the 145th Hay Show. If you worked in the shearing sheds, as I did through the 1980s, Hay was notorious as a place shearers would avoid due to some particularly big, rough and wrinkly merino sheep. While tough for shearers, it was good for graziers, with this region being the birthplace of the modern merino and at the centre of a golden era for Australia's wool industry. So it wasn't surprising to see some magnificent fleeces on display, along with superb garden produce, fabulous flowers and children's crafts. By far, the largest gathering assembled for the dog jump, with a dozen or so dogs, mainly kelpies, facing up to what from a dog's height must have looked like an unassailable rock face. To see them jump and scramble over an obstacle several times their size, with owners alongside to catch their mate if they didn't quite make it, was quite something. The winner was from interstate, with owner Gary from Tungamah in Victoria joining us later for a drink at the 'Riv' hotel and telling me that a ribbon for 'Bluey' meant much more than the prize money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to Jill Chapman, president of the show society, and all the volunteers, who worked so hard to showcase this unique town and region. Hay may have developed off the sheep's back, but it is growing in prosperity through developments in irrigated agriculture, as cotton now joins rice in helping maintain the region's healthy future.</span>

Let's have a look. Black spots: promised $220 million over three years; actual: $115 million. Heavy Vehicles Safety and Productivity Program around those regional roads: promised $171 million in the first three years; delivered: $64.6 million, cut by $107 million—the Bruce Highway cut and the Pacific Highway cut. The Northern Australia Investment Facility: not a single dollar actually spent. The only money that has gone out is for the board meetings that are held in the CBD in Sydney! Not a single dollar out of that program! Financial assistance grants: frozen.</span>

It's taken the member for New England facing a by-election before they've even called tenders!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I rise to congratulation two of Maranoa's fantastic winemakers from the Granite Belt region for their achievements in the 2017 Queensland Wine Awards held last month. Firstly, congratulations to David and Shirley Zanatta and their family for taking out the Samuel Bassett Award. This award recognises those in the industry who have made an outstanding contribution over time to advancing the wine industry. The Zanattas have been actively involved in promoting the wine industry for more than 40 years, including 34 years running the Old Caves Winery in Stanthorpe. In true family style, the Zanattas ran the family-owned small business with their sons, Anthony, Jeremy and Nathan.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I'd like to congratulate Mike Hayes from Symphony Hill Wines in Ballandean on his stellar performance in taking out 28 of the 93 medals up for grabs and four trophies, including Queensland Winemaker of the Year. Mike is also one of four finalists to have been nominated to win the Australian Society of Viticulture and Enology Winemaker of the Year. He is the first Queenslander to be nominated and become a finalist in these awards. The winner will be announced in Adelaide on November 14. I wish Mike all the best for the awards and congratulate him on becoming a finalist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maranoa is home to arguably some of the greatest wine in the country. It's no surprise that countries from around the world have developed a taste for Maranoa's fine wines. I encourage every Australian to visit the great Granite Belt and South Burnett regions to sample our fantastic wines.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad to see the Prime Minister in the House to account for these things. Surely people opposite understand that every poor decision and every service cut imposed by government has a disproportionate impact on those living in rural and regional Australia? Now, after years of cutting their working conditions, the Prime Minister wants to feign care for blue-collar workers. He suddenly has an interest in coalminers and power station workers. The next time he meets one, it will be the first, Mr Speaker! Driving past the power stations and the coalmines, crying out to the driver, 'There they are!' isn't good enough. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It was a great day in Highton when we announced that nearly all of the premises in Belmont, Waurn Ponds and Wandana Heights would be connected in November and December through to January. We're also tackling the very important issue of broadband speeds. We are holding the retail service providers to account when they do not deliver the speeds that they should. We are very proud of the way that the NBN has been rolled out across Corangamite and across this great country; 77,000 premises will be connected to the NBN by January of next year.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are putting downward pressure on gas and electricity prices, and we are ensuring that the system becomes more reliable not just today, but in the months and years ahead. We're planning for Australia's future energy needs, not like the Labor Party and their leader, the member for Maribyrnong, who, when the consequences of the Liddell Power Station closing down in 2022 was set out by AEMO, saying, 'This is going to create a big gap in dispatchable or baseload power'—</span>

                  </a>  What did he say? He said, 'I think that's an issue down the track'. I guess that was what the member for Port Adelaide thought when they ignored the expert's advice that allowing unrestricted gas exports would create a shortage of supply on the year's growth, that it was another 'issue down the track'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Port Adelaide, the great confessor himself, finally confessed under the steely interrogation of David Speers. He'd managed to avoid confessing when he was interrogated by Barrie Cassidy, but Speers finally got him. He speared him, in fact. The member for Port Adelaide said, 'Everyone knew there was going to be an impact on prices.' Now this is more a case of idiocy than ideology. Labor's energy policy has been driven by ideology and idiocy; together, it is an absolutely fatal combination as far as Australians' power bills are concerned. No forethought and no care whatsoever. So when they demand that we should take action—and, of course, as I'll describe, we already are—they're really saying, 'Please fix up the mess we created.' That's what they're saying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we made our announcement that we would take steps to restrict exports to protect the domestic market, wholesale spot prices in July were as low as $6 a gigajoule. They currently sit around $6 to $10 a gigajoule, down from $12 to $14 earlier in the year, so we are already seeing a result. LNG operator Santos announced that 30 petajoules of gas will be diverted from exports in 2018 and 2019. That's enough gas for 330,000 homes for two years. So you're already seeing positive results—</span>

Power prices have never been higher than they are under this Liberal government, now in its fifth year. The Prime Minister used to acknowledge that the fastest way to bring down power prices was to act on gas. Is the government refusing to pull the trigger on gas export controls because there are serious legal doubts about the ministerial actions of the Deputy Prime Minister? Why are doubts about his deputy standing in the way of lower power prices for Australians today?</span>

The minister's determination, which is a determination that puts precise restrictions on exports, is one that was taken after a considerable amount of consultation and information and advice. And that comes from the agencies, from ACCC, from AEMO; it obviously requires a lot of consultation and insight into what's going on in the industry. As honourable members will have heard, there is more gas coming into the market as we stand.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:14</span>):  I thank the member for Grey for his question because he knows how to stand up for jobs and small businesses in his electorate. He knows how to do that. We saw that with his keen advocacy for the changes that we have made to small business taxation to ensure that they are paying lower taxes, to ensure that we are cutting the compliance burden for small business, to ensure that we are evening up the playing field with changes to the competition laws and, in particular, putting downward pressure into everything we do when it comes to energy prices. We saw from the member for Grey the advocacy that is needed for regional communities when he stood up for the people of Whyalla and ensured that the steel plant continued to remain open, that a buyer was secured and that the support was there. But he is not the only member of rural and regional communities who knows how to stand up for their community. The member for Wannon stood up for the workers of Portland. He ensured that Alcoa stayed open and that the hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on that plant remained open. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suggest that the rural and regional members, particularly those opposite from the Hunter Valley, should take a leaf out of the books of the member for Grey and the member for Wannon. It is those members who are standing in the way of the sensible policies of the Turnbull government to put downward pressure on rising energy prices, especially for small businesses. The no-coal coalition of the Hunter members of those opposite have put up the white flag on all the coalmining and energy jobs that sit in the Hunter Valley. They stand against our plans to ensure that we sweat the coal-fired power assets for longer to ensure that we have greater stability in the energy market and greater stability of baseload power in the energy market. That is part of the Turnbull government's plan to put downward pressure on the rising forces on electricity prices. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:19</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Human Services. Minister, Centrelink is one of the most prevalent complaints to my office. People tell me it is an impenetrable system where they call and can't get through or go to the office only to be told to call, or they try myGov which crashes or is not helpful. People often wait months for the application to be processed, documents go missing or their application stalls and they are not told. Minister, we're talking about the disabled, sick, unemployed and homeless, as well as the aged, carers, families and students—vulnerable people. Clearly, Centrelink is at breaking point, despite the very best efforts of the staff. When will you say, 'Enough is enough,' and fix it?</span>

                  </a>  We started with a focus on the student payments, and already we are seeing the processing times for student claims halved. Just this month was the first time we have had a straight-through process of a claim, and by the end of this year about 10 per cent of all claims will be straight-through processed, which means they will be instantaneously done. We have introduced a claim tracker so that people can monitor their claim on their phone without having to call the call centre. We have introduced a virtual assistant, which means you get an instantaneous answer on your computer. Since June alone, 95,000 questions have been answered through that virtual assistant. We are moving on to the other large programs payments and doing a similar size transformation. We will soon be doing Newstart, then the age pension and then the disability support pension and other payments.</span>

Specifically, we have re-engineered the claims processes for the farm household allowance, for the disability support pension and for the age pension. For DSP alone, we have cut the claim-processing time by half for most claims. The farm household allowance claims have been cut from four months to four weeks. On call-waiting times: as we announced in the budget, we are adding 250 additional staff, who will be progressively rolled out over the next few months.</span>

You should take a look at it on your mobile phone. Just today we expect 265,000 people to log on to myGov, which is an increase from about 165,000 people just 12 months previously. About 10 million people are on myGov and transact digitally.

I thank the honourable member for her question. It's a shame about the lack of respect that the Labor Party has for its own question time. It's like the lack of respect the Labor Party has for its own coal workers and manufacturing workers. It's like the lack of respect the member for Shortland has in standing up for his coal workers. It's like the lack of respect the member for Hunter has in standing up for his coal workers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the seat of Calare, we have seen the great turnaround in agriculture. What we've seen in agriculture in the last GDP figures is that, in the June quarter, agriculture was the fastest growing sector. We are the government that has proved its success and has delivered a better outcome for our nation—nearly a 30 per cent increase in the gross value of farm production since we have been in government. Even in the member for Calare's seat, we've seen that the gross value of wool has increased by 15 per cent since 2012-13, and the gross value of beef has increased by 15 per cent since 2012-13. The member for Calare is very proud of the $4 billion Regional Investment Corporation being set up in Orange.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is always a threat, and of course the threat is power prices. We've seen what the Labor Party can do to power prices. Just look at South Australia. What a fiasco! What a catastrophe—Labor Party power policy! When we try to get behind it, this is what we get from the member for Port Adelaide. In regard to Liddell, he says: 'We don't have a problem with old plants closing. The problem is we don't have a plan.' I can understand that. That is the problem the Labor Party have. They stand away from their belief in those workers. They stand away from the blue-collar workers whom they once upon a time represented.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Bill should remember the electricity market reforms were started by the Keating government. He is sounding more and more like a left-wing socialist ideologue. Labor's 50 per cent renewable energy target is a further betrayal of blue-collar workers …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's coming from one of their own, talking about the betrayal of blue-collar workers, because they'd rather play parlour games than actually represent the people in regional Australia, including their own members—the people in Shortland, Hunter, Townsville and Newcastle. They have given up on their blue-collar workers for the basket weavers, and they turn their back on the Australian people. That's why the Leader of the Opposition's personal approval polling goes down. His goes up; yours goes down. That's what happens, because they believe the Leader of the Opposition's just a little bit shifty. They believe he's just a little bit shifty, and that's why this debate has— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Can the Prime Minister confirm that on 18 July Senator Canavan became aware of the possibility he was an Italian citizen, on 24 July Senator Canavan issued a legal instrument notifying the government's intention to pull the trigger on gas export controls, and the next day Senator Canavan resigned from cabinet? Why did the Prime Minister allow Senator Canavan to make decisions on gas export controls the day before he resigned as a minister when he was already fully aware there were doubts over his qualifications to be a member of parliament?</span>

He's owned up. Why he wants to keep on doing this public penance and sticking his head up and talking about gas is beyond me, because it gives us the opportunity to reflect on why my government has had to take the measures it has to ensure Australians have affordable gas. And we know why we've had to take that action. It is because of the failure of the Labor government, despite sensible, strong, considered advice from AEMO, from their own department, that allowing unrestricted export of gas would push up prices and restrict supply. It's fairly obvious, actually—a penetrating glimpse of the obvious, you might think—but, nonetheless, they ignored it. It was, I suppose, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, an issue that they could deal with down the track. But the fact is: we are—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr CIOBO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:42</span>):  I thank the member for Parkes for his question, because it goes to something we, on this side of the House, are passionate about, which is: boosting Australia's exports. On this side of the House, like the member for Parkes, we are also passionate about making sure that Australians have jobs in Australia's resources sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the ways that we're doing that, I was pleased to announce today, is through Efic. Efic is, of course, our export credit agency. Over the last financial year, Efic has provided some $400 million worth of finance for around 170 export contracts. What the Turnbull coalition government are doing is making sure we're giving Efic the tools it needs to do even more to support our exporters in terms of taking exports overseas, driving our economy and creating job growth here in Australia. Last week we saw the Efic amendment bill pass through the parliament, which will allow Efic to offer a broader range of support to exporters. Today, I was pleased to build upon this. We are doing so through increasing the scope under Efic's statement of expectations so that Efic has got more ability to finance onshore resource projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member has asked about what some of the radical groups are doing that is threatening this. The fact is that we are seeing a campaign. We've seen, for example, the stepped-up campaigning of activist groups which is discouraging our major retail banks from financing otherwise-viable exporters in the coal sector. But it's not just about coal. It's also about what we can do in other sectors within resources, including—and I note this is in the member for Parkes's own area—Alkane's Dubbo rare earths project, which is going to help to drive exports and create more jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the simple fact is that there are other radical plans that we are seeing. We increasingly see it from the Labor opposition. I was having a look recently at what the member for Sydney said—talking about radical action groups. The member for Sydney said: 'In environmental terms'—these are her words—'we're looking at losing Kakadu National Park and losing the ability to feed ourselves.' That's what the member for Sydney says about what is happening in terms of coal exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also recognise that, typical of the Australian Labor Party, who like to walk both sides of the street, if you're a radical greenie concerned about kale, then you can go with the member for Sydney. But, if you're a more sensible person who's concerned about coal, I guess you could go with the Leader of the Opposition, who says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am not a rampant greenie who thinks there is no place for fossil fuel in our energy mix in the future …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />That's the problem with the shifty member opposite. It doesn't matter which side you want to put forward, whether it's the radical green element that's represented by the member for Sydney or it's someone trying to masquerade as being more mainstream. The fact is that the Australian Labor Party have no fixed position. They'll walk both sides of the street on this issue, and only the coalition is willing to make the hard decisions.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Welcome back! It's been over 100 days. I thought the Speaker might have to call the roll to see if you'd been in the chamber today. I haven't seen you for a long time. But I am happy to report on the better days ahead that the Turnbull government are producing as a result of our strong economic plan that is cutting taxes for small businesses, cutting taxes that those opposite want to put up again. We are cutting taxes that those opposite will put up again, because we know that from the Leader of the Opposition, who said, just as recently as in the last 24 hours, that he is going to spend the $65 billion that is available to cut taxes for Australian businesses on other things. To do that, he has to reverse the small business tax cuts for firms earning up to $50 million in turnover each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition is going put a big tax whack on small businesses all around this country. He's also going to put up taxes on housing. He's going to put up taxes on investment and increase it by over 50 per cent and not just on residential housing but on shops, on offices and on warehouses—increasing the tax on warehouses as well. He's going to put a tax on family businesses. He's going to put a tax on people's savings as they try and save more for their superannuation. The shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition's plan is to increase taxes above what they are today on people's savings. He's also going to increase the tax on wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are six big taxes that the shadow Treasurer wants to put on an Australian economy that is emerging again, $150 billion and more in higher taxes. He wants to take a big, wet, soggy, tax blanket and throw it right over the Australian economy. That is the plan of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. They have no plans to drive growth in this economy and no plans to drive jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 240,000 people have got jobs in the last fiscal year. In the last six months—as he well knows—we have had the greatest job growth in full-time employment in six months in the last 40 years. Now the plans of those opposite are to completely pull the rug out, not just by quenching it with higher taxes but by driving up electricity prices with their 45 per cent emissions reduction target, which will put an additional electricity tax on the Australian people. Their renewable energy target of 50 per cent will put growth out on its mat. That is the plan of the shadow Treasurer, who hasn't had the gumption to stand in this place and ask a question of me on the economy in more than 100 days.</span>

That includes enabling the gas suppliers to put more gas into the domestic market. We welcome the announcements from both Origin and Santos recently. We're doing work to rein in the power of the poles-and-wires companies. While the Labor Party wants to send it off to committee, we introduce legislation to abolish the limited merits review. And we have won significant concessions from retailers to offer Australian families a better deal.</span>

                  </a>  Unlike the Labor Party, which has no policy to put downward pressure on rising energy prices, the Turnbull government does have a plan. We have plans, and those plans have the following elements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, we are securing Australian gas where we need it—at home to drive gas prices down—and have put the mechanisms in place to ensure that we can deliver on that. Secondly, we are calling the retail energy companies to account and ensuring that Australian consumers and Australian businesses get the best possible deal. We are doing that not just with the direct initiatives of the Prime Minister and the energy minister with those companies, which are already seeing Australians going and getting a better deal, as we know, right now. But we are doing it through the work of the ACCC, who are doing the inquiries on both gas and retail electricity. Thirdly, we have abolished the limited merits review process, which was putting upward pressure on energy prices. We are ensuring our regulations aren't driving up energy prices but, to the contrary, are putting downward pressures on those prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing over $3 billion in lower-emissions technologies through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and, importantly, we are working to deliver a new investment framework which can guarantee the certainty necessary for both domestic and international investors to invest in future energy supply in this country. That means everything from keeping Liddell open, which those opposite want to close, to seeing the increased investment going to renewable technologies, into storage technologies and seeing that delivered on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a comprehensive plan which is designed to put downward pressure on rising energy prices. What those opposite propose is a 45 per cent emissions reduction target, which is a great, big, fat electricity tax, which is being sponsored by the Leader of the Opposition—the shiftiest Leader of the Opposition that the Australian people have known about for a long period of time. If he gets to slither into The Lodge, they will feel the effects! If he went to Hogwarts, he would have been in the house of Slytherin. The only difference is some in Slytherin came good in the end, unlike this Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:54</span>):  I thank the member for Corangamite for her question. Of course, it is very important that members of unions be able to have confidence that their union is being operated in their interests and not in the interests of union leaders or, for that matter, corrupt employers and businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, members remember that last Thursday, I outlined the fact that IUS Holdings, an income protection company, paid $566,000 to the Australian Workers' Union during the time that the Leader of the Opposition was the secretary of that union, between 2004 and 2007. In return for those payments—we have no idea what the payments to the union were for—they became the preferred provider of income protection for 28 enterprise business agreements that the AWU was negotiating with employers at that time. So $566,000 of unexplained payments flowed to the AWU from IUS Holdings, and the union negotiated 28 EBAs with businesses that made IUS Holdings their preferred income protection business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since I raised that point here last Thursday, the Leader of the Opposition has had three set piece press conferences and has not explained to the press conference what these payments were for. Usually, he comes into the House and makes a personal explanation and explains why these payments—or whatever they might be—are of no consequence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that isn't the only payment that the workers of the AWU didn't know anything about during that period from 2004 to 2007. Unfortunately, while the Leader of the Opposition was the head of the AWU a company called Incolink gave $165,000 of unexplained payments to the AWU. As well as that, there were $90,000 in brokerage fees and $150,000 for an opaquely-named business called Incolink Project, yet to be explained. None of this was explained or exposed to the workers of the AWU. Coincidentally, the Victorian AWU negotiated 41 EBAs with those businesses during that time payments were being made when, amazingly, Incolink was the preferred worker entitlement fund for every one of those EBAs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition needs to explain why those payments were being made, what the payments were for and what Incolink got for them. He needs to explain that and what happened with IUS Holdings before it's too late.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:01</span>):  I thank the member for Fisher for his question. The Turnbull government is introducing a comprehensive package of reforms to Australia's compulsory superannuation system which is designed to protect members' money and members' interests. The superannuation sector manages around $2.3 trillion in retirement savings and Australians rightly expect the industry to be held to the highest levels of transparency and accountability. It is always very important to remind ourselves that this money is the property of each and every hardworking Australian superannuation fund member—not the government, not the industry, not the bank executives, not the shareholders, not the employers and not the trade union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will be making changes to give the regulator, APRA, greater powers to investigate all superannuation funds and powers to prevent fraud and mismanagement inside funds, as well as making new requirements to force funds to be more transparent and more accountable to their members. Currently, APRA has no powers to make funds report detailed information about how they spend members' money. Now, clearly, that has to change. Today we have seen reports in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper which demonstrate exactly why these types of reforms are needed, detailing millions of dollars of hidden payments from superannuation funds to unions, estimated at around about $8 million per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, Cbus, the superannuation arm of the CFMEU, last year reported payments of over $1 million in sponsorship fees to sponsoring unions, which included the ACTU, the CFMEU, the AMWU, the ETU, the PTEU and, if that list weren't long enough, the AWU. How payments such as these are in the best interests of individual Australians who have their superannuation in these funds is entirely unclear. What these payments are actually paying for is in reality unknown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to questionable payments by the AWU we need look no further than the Leader of the Opposition. When he was the AWU national secretary, $25,000 of AWU members' money was donated to his own campaign for the seat of Maribyrnong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time that the Leader of the Opposition was both campaigning in Maribyrnong and the AWU national secretary, he was also a director of AustralianSuper, who made sponsorship payments to the AWU. The Leader of the Opposition has made it very clear he will always act in his own political interests. We stand behind workers and we will act in their interests. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, the energy minister can no doubt elaborate on this himself, but I just make this point: I have made exactly the same observation. The reality is this: there is a transition in the energy market from thermal power to cleaner sources of generation. That is a fact. But the critical thing is to ensure that those changes do not take place at the expense of affordability and reliability. This is a question of ensuring that you have all of the above. I set this out in my speech at the beginning of the year at the Press Club. We need to make sure our energy policy is guided by engineering and economics. The problem with the Labor Party, and we have seen this in the contribution from the member for Shortland, is that they want to turn this into an anti-coal campaign. It is nonsense—it is complete and utter nonsense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the largest exporter of seaborne coal in the world. We have a national vested interest in seeing coal continue to play an important role in energy generation here and around the world but at the same time contributing to reduced emissions. So, when the honourable member said clean coal is a fiction that's got no future, what he was basically saying to many of the workers in his electorate was, 'You are all out of a job.' You would think that what he would be doing, and what the Labor Party would be doing, is supporting the government in ensuring that we have a rational approach to energy that deploys every form of generation. They all have certain characteristics; they all have a lot to deliver. But, if you have a policy driven by left-wing ideology and sheer idiocy and incompetence, then that is what you get from Labor. You get gas prices going through the roof and the failure to do anything to back up renewables. Labor has been a colossal failure on energy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration and Border Protection</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  I want to say thank you very much to the member for Tangney for his question. Like all members on this side of the House, he's absolutely determined to make sure that we keep people smugglers out of business. We don't want to see children in detention again. Eight thousand children went into detention under the Labor Party. We don't want to see deaths at sea again. There were 1,200 people who drowned at sea under the Labor Party. The fact is that the people smugglers are still there. They are still in business and, as people see on the Mediterranean now, there are people drowning there as they attempt to get to Europe. There are significant national security consequences for a country that cannot secure its borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition went to the last election promising to have a carbon copy of the Liberal Party policy to present to the Australian public. Somehow, he was on the same page as us and nothing would change if Labor got into power, but—do you know?—we had heard that story before. We heard it when Kevin Rudd was coming into power in 2007, when he said, hand on heart, that his would just be a carbon-copy policy of John Howard and that nothing would change. The same policy settings would be in place. Just like Mr Rudd got mugged by the Left of his party, so it turns out that the Leader of the Opposition has been mugged by the Left of his party, and, bit by bit, we're seeing the Labor Party undo its policy in relation to Operation Sovereign Borders. The fact is that the Labor Party doesn't have the capacity to stare down the people smugglers and the reality is that, at the next election, the Leader of the Opposition will say again to the Australian public that there will be no change if he's elected as Prime Minister and that the same policies will be presided over, but we know that this Leader of the Opposition is shifty and he can't be trusted. The reality is, as we've said time and time again—as Daniel Andrews has demonstrated in Victoria, a government that's led by the CFMEU—the Labor Left will not allow a policy which sees boats stopped, deaths at sea stopped and children out of detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will not deviate from the policy that it took to the last election and the election before that, because it has produced results. The Labor Party, under this shifty Leader of the Opposition, cannot say to the Australian public that they will honour the policies, because already they have announced that they will walk away from particular elements of Operation Sovereign Borders, which has seen success in stopping those boats. The Australian public know that, when this Leader of the Opposition opens his mouth, he can't be trusted. They know that, when he says that he will adopt the policies of this government, they only have to look at the track record. He hasn't even waited to get into government before he's undone the policies. And what the Australian public know of this Leader of the Opposition is: he can't be trusted.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr COLEMAN:</span>
                    </a>  On 1 August 2017 the RBA decided to leave official interest rates on hold at 1.5 per cent. In making this decision, the governor commented that 'holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the public hearing held before the committee on 11 August 2017, the governor noted that the global economy has strengthened and, as a result, the RBA expects domestic economic conditions to improve. The RBA forecasts Australia's GDP growth to rise above two per cent in late 2017, to 2¾ to 3¾ per cent over the year to December 2018. Continued growth is being supported by accommodative monetary policy, an increase in LNG exports, and employment growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Underlying inflation is somewhat higher than late last year, and the RBA forecasts that it will reach around two per cent over the second half of 2017, at the bottom end of the RBA's target. Headline inflation is expected to lie between two and three per cent over the year to December 2019, with the consumer price index (CPI) forecast to rise to around two percent by the end of 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its low point in January 2016, the Australian dollar has appreciated considerably against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. The governor stated that the current exchange rate will 'contribute to subdued price pressures in the economy'. The governor added that an appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in slower economic growth and inflation than currently forecast, and the exchange rate is an issue which continues to be of great interest to the RBA and the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the beginning of 2017, around 165,000 full-time jobs have been created in Australia, average hours worked have increased, and labour force participation has risen. The RBA expects that the recent strong growth in employment and increased household income will support consumption growth, moderated by high levels of household debt and lower wage growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Business investment in Australia is expected to increase gradually as growth in demand increases. The RBA noted that conditions are currently favourable for stronger growth in business investment, including low interest rates and reduced tax rates for small and medium sized businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, Australia's economic growth outlook, according to the Reserve Bank, is positive, with the transition to lower levels of mining investment almost complete—and indeed we've seen the impact of that in recent business investment figures. Increases in the production of LNG are expected to help to contribute to GDP growth in Australia of between two and three per cent for the year to the end of 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Lowe, and his colleagues for appearing at the hearing before our committee in Melbourne on 11 August 2017.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  by leave—I concur with the member for Banks in thanking the governor and various representatives of the Reserve Bank for once again appearing before the House economics committee. It was a wide-ranging discussion of issues associated with monetary policy, energy policy, income, inequality and banking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do wish to make a few comments regarding the situation with the banking sector in Australia and energy policy. These are all contained in the committee's comprehensive report, particularly at page 17 of the report, where we were having a discussion with the Reserve Bank governor regarding the situation in the banking sector in Australia, most notably the allegations against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that have been levelled by AUSTRAC in respect of breaches of Australia's anti-money-laundering and terrorism financing laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The governor made three important points in respect of banking culture in Australia. First he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On trust, I think it's fair to say that trust in banking has been strained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On service: I think it's fair to say that service has taken a back seat to sales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I think we can all identify examples where the desire for short-term profit has probably led to not enough attention to risk management issues. So the focus needs to be on rebuilding trust and delivering high-quality service to customers, and a strong focus on risk management. Those are the things that we need to focus on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From Labor's perspective, we totally agree with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It's our view and certainly the view of the people of Australia that the best way to do that is to establish a royal commission into the banking industry in Australia to get to the bottom of exactly what's going on in this industry; uncover some of the scandals, the rip-offs and the hurt and financial pain that it's caused for many Australians; and have an independent arbiter look at the issues and put together a set of recommendations that a government could adopt to improve confidence, trust, stability and those issues that the Reserve Bank governor mentioned: trust, service and risk management in the Australian banking industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of energy policy, there was a wide-ranging conversation with the Reserve Bank representatives about the parlous state of Australia's energy sector and the fact that energy prices have been increasing for some years and are putting a lot of stress on household budgets. The Reserve Bank governor made the point that it's becoming quite dire. He made the point very well that the major focus, the major factor, that's causing the problems in the energy sector in Australia is the lack of certainty regarding business investment. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is uncertainty about the policy environment and that is delaying investment. That is not in dispute. The investment uncertainty is not just in electricity generation; it's affecting investment decisions in other parts of the economy, because businesses aren't sure about the future price of electricity, so it's another reason to wait.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The higher prices of electricity are also affecting household budgets, particularly for lower income households, who spend a disproportionately high share of their income on electricity. It's crimping their budgets and having an effect on consumption, and it's going to have an effect on the CPI as well. So investment uncertainty, spending decisions and the CPI are the perspectives that we're looking at this from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… providing some certainty about the future structure of the electricity generation industry would be useful for the country, for investment, on prices and on household budgets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not the Labor Party speaking there; that's the Reserve Bank governor of Australia, in many respects the chief economist in this country. That's his view of what is going on in Australia at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of certainty with respect to energy policy that has been created by the Turnbull government is having a serious effect on business investment, business profitability and household budgets in this country. It is the fact that this Turnbull government argues amongst itself and can't make up its mind on a clean energy target that is having a massive effect on energy reliability, on investment in the industry and, ultimately, on households' budgets. The ball is well and truly in the government's court. It needs to come to a decision on a clean energy target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the governor made important points, most notably about inequality:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's a legitimate issue, people are rightly worried about it, but on many measures we're doing better than some other countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The wages share of income in this country has been falling for some decades now. In the last 10 years, the incomes of those in the top 10 per cent of the income brackets have grown by 72 per cent, whereas the incomes in the bottom tenth of Australian household income earners have grown by only 23 per cent. That statistic alone says it all about the state of income inequality in this country. It's a very real issue, and I'm glad the RBA governor pointed this out. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  To conclude my remarks on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017: what we've seen, in the measures that the government wants to introduce to delay payments to people who apply for welfare assistance, is a desperate move from a desperate government. Then we saw, in question time today, an answer from the minister which has outdone Chemical Ali during the war in Iraq, when he was denying what was happening there. Just as in the sketch in <span style="font-style:italic;">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</span> where the Black Knight was denying what was happening to him at the time, the minister, totally out of touch with reality, suggested that the process that people are going through with Centrelink at the moment has been improved and that there are no problems with it. Nothing could be further from the truth than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government is saying is: 'We're going to put you through an even more difficult process than you already go through right now. You won't get your payments commenced until the process is finished—not at the time you start—by a department that is totally either underresourced or overwhelmed with applications.' The government knows exactly what it's doing. It is deliberately and intentionally wanting to delay the start of the payments in order to save a few dollars so that it can then try and balance its budget. Nothing could be more unjust and unfair than what this government is proposing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last matter, as to the unfairness, goes to the treatment that this government wants to dish out to people who are 55 years and over, where it is now saying that you can no longer fulfil your commitment to society by volunteering in your community; you will have to, like the rest of the people looking for support payments, go through applying for jobs or be in paid employment. I made the point earlier, at the beginning of my remarks, that there simply are not jobs out there. When there are far more people looking for jobs than there are jobs available, employers will not give people who are 55 years and over much of a look-in at all. It is going to be incredibly difficult for them to get jobs which are simply not there. And yet, again, this government is saying to them: 'If you don't go through this process, we will also take away payments from you.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is getting about as low as it possibly can when it starts putting those sorts of pressures on people who are clearly depending on the welfare system not because they want to but because they have no choice. We will have more of those people over the coming months—particularly in the region that I represent, because of the closure of Holden—and, quite frankly, to bring in this legislation and make their life even more difficult than it currently is just shows the depths that this government will sink to in order to try and balance its budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those reasons, of course, I will not be supporting this legislation and will be supporting the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga. The government may well be trying to get the legislation through by saying that, amongst the 18 measures contained in this legislation, there are some good ones, but the bad ones clearly outnumber the good ones, and this legislation should not be supported.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  I wish to join with my colleagues in rising to speak against the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 and condemning the actions of this government. There are many proposed measures contained in this legislation that those on our side cannot in good conscience support. These include the axing of the bereavement allowance—an especially callous and cruel part of this legislation. The bereavement payment is a very short-term payment offered to those whose partners have recently died. In addition to the axing of the bereavement payment, this legislation seeks to push the starting date for some participation payments to new roles. It removes the intent-to-claim provisions that have been longstanding in the Centrelink regime. It also looks at changes to what constitutes a reasonable excuse. Finally, of course, it seeks to introduce a proposed trial for drug testing of those on social security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is wrong in so many ways, but I particularly want to focus today on the component of this legislation that goes to the drug-testing trial of the social security recipients. It is shameful that this government has attempted to frame this policy as some type of health measure—as if targeting and punishing vulnerable and addicted Australians is somehow in their best interests and, indeed, in the best interests of our community. This policy is nothing more than a crass savings measure, and not a very good one at that. This policy will, in all likelihood, end up costing taxpayers more and achieving very little. The proposed trial is far from good, evidence-based policy making. It runs against all expert advice. It is so poorly thought out that some experts warn that, if rolled out, it may actually increase crime and drug use in our community. This trial could also inadvertently impact the medical treatment and rehabilitation of people suffering from drug and alcohol addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Speaker, you will not find a single organisation working in the field of drug and alcohol rehabilitation that will support this punitive policy. What you will find, however, is a great number of medical experts, addiction specialists and widespread community groups who have strongly urged the government against introducing this policy. I want to list just some of those organisations that have spoken out against this proposed drug-testing trial, because it's important that their considered opinions are noted and their opposition is recorded as part of this debate. These respected organisations include: the Australian Medical Association; the Royal Australasian College of Physicians; the Australasian Chapter of Addiction Medicine; the Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs; the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists; St Vincent's Health Australia; the Rural Doctors Association of Australia; Harm Reduction Australia; the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation; the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre; the Penington Institute; the Kirby Institute at UNSW; the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association; 360 Edge, a specialist alcohol and other drug consultancy; the Australian Council of Social Service; UnitingCare Australia; Homelessness Australia; the St Vincent de Paul Society; the Wayside Chapel; Anglicare; Catholic Social Services Australia; the National Social Security Rights Network; Community Mental Health Australia; the Public Health Association of Australia; the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services; and the Ted Noffs Foundation. There are others, but time does not allow me to continue the list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rest assured that you will not find one medical expert who has come out to defend this as sound drug and alcohol addiction policy. Why? Because it is not. Even the CEO of Jobs Australia, David Thompson, has slammed the policy, saying he thinks all it will do is stop people asking for help because 'they feel the whole process … is really quite demeaning and humiliating'. If the government is trying to pretend that this is somehow a policy justifiable on health grounds, they are deceiving both themselves and the Australian people. The government needs to listen to the experts. The experts have made it crystal clear that this drug-testing trial will not work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A doctor in my electorate, in Newcastle, recently contacted me, pleading for this policy not to go ahead. She is a doctor who is a medical specialist trained in paediatrics, epidemiology and genetics, and has had considerable experience working with families damaged by Stolen Generation pain, violence and abuse. She has written to me saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of the children of these families, as well as children with learning difficulties, autistic traits and severe anxiety turn to self-medication with alcohol and drugs in adolescence, or adulthood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The idea that stopping their pocket money will remove this need or prevent substance abuse is childish and petulant. How can we as a developed nation continue to let ourselves fall into these punitive and silly games to make our politicians look 'strong'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what doctors in my electorate are saying.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians go to their doctors and listen to them for medical advice. It's time that Malcolm Turnbull did the same. Mr Turnbull needs to listen to a doctor like Dr Anna Kelly, a general practitioner working in my electorate of Newcastle, who has also written a powerful letter arguing for this policy not to go ahead. Dr Kelly writes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a General Practitioner working in Newcastle, I have treated hundreds of people with drug and alcohol problems.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They often come from very difficult backgrounds; have a history of trauma including sexual abuse and domestic violence. Many have grown up in homes where drug and alcohol abuse and violence has been the norm. They miss out on education due to their difficult circumstances, leave home early to escape the hardship and experimenting with drugs leads to a drug and alcohol addiction problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With time, support, effort, empathy and access to resources, I have seen many get through their problem and break the poverty/drug and alcohol/violence generational cycle. Unfortunately due to lack of resources, it is difficult to get the right help at the right time for many of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I also see the children and extended families of people affected with drug and alcohol problems. They are ready to get help/support, but can't do it alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If drug and alcohol addicted people are prevented from receiving their Centrelink payments they will be forced into crime. People may be wanting to stop their addiction, but may not be able to do it alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we stop their income, crime will increase, and seeking help will be even more difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The funds used to police such a program would be much better spent in drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and for services to help the children and families of drug and alcohol affected people. Leave the punitive activities to our police force and fund adequately the services to help people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the message from doctors in my electorate of Newcastle. These are doctors and medical experts who deal with the problem of drug and alcohol addiction every day. They are lining up to denounce this cruel and misguided policy proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nobody doubts that we face significant problems with drug addiction in our community, but there is simply no evidence that this trial will work. The problem of drug addiction requires a medical response. A punitive approach where the government is pursuing people on welfare who may or may not have a drug issue is not a reasonable way to deal with this important matter of public health. There is not a single extra cent in the health budget for any of the proposed drug trial sites. Precious taxpayer dollars would be better spent investing in support and rehabilitation services for those living with drug and alcohol addictions and their families. Without extra funding for treatment this trial will likely put pressure on an already overstretched and under-resourced system with long waiting lists, displacing people seeking help and further exacerbating the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this government had done even the smallest amount of research, they would have seen that drug testing of income support recipients has been trialled many times in many other countries, with no evidence to suggest that it is an effective measure to treat drug use in any of them. I take just one example—from New Zealand, our closest neighbour. The New Zealand government introduced a drug-testing program amongst welfare recipients in 2015. Only 22 of the 8,001 participants tested returned a positive result for illicit drug use. Just 22; that is just 0.2 per cent, a very small minority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point I'm trying to make here is that this flawed policy is not new. It has been tried before, and each time the result has been the same: it has not detected many positive results, and it has been very costly to deliver, which goes some way to explain why this government is refusing to give an estimate of the program's cost. However, regardless of the as yet unknown costs of this program, it is very difficult to see from any of the international evidence that this is an effective use of precious taxpayers' dollars. What we see here is just a cheap, populist and lazy policy from a government that is so worried about its own jobs that it has given up on trying to help vulnerable Australians. The idea that you would test tens of thousands of people and a few people may be found to have a positive test for the use of illicit drugs is not an effective use of those taxpayers' dollars, and it certainly will not help those few people who have genuine substance abuse problems—the very people that we should be seeking to reach out to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should be focusing its resources on helping vulnerable people seek treatment for drug addiction, not making tokenistic gestures to appear tough. Drug and alcohol addictions are complex public health problems, and they require a public health policy response. I wish to close with a quote from Dr Marianne Jauncey, from the Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs, because I think it perfectly sums up just why this is such a bad policy. She says:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">it's being spent in a way all the available evidence tells us won't work.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She goes on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Doctors don't necessarily speak with a united voice—we're a very varied group of specialists and people with different backgrounds across the country, so when you do hear doctors speaking with a united voice I think people should listen.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with Dr Jauncey. She is absolutely right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have listened to the expert advice from health professionals, and we oppose this drug-testing trial of social security recipients. It's time that the Turnbull government dumped this expensive trial that everyone says simply will not work. I stand with my Labor colleagues condemning this legislation, and I stand in support of the amendments moved by the member for Jagajaga.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  I think when it comes to the legislation before the House today, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017, what we've got is legislation that really reeks of politics. That's what this is about. If we cast our minds back to the budget night, where I think the Minister for Human Services was going to go down the sewer and collect human waste material and test it, it was, at that point, a very half-baked idea. Of course, it's months and months later, and now we finally see, after the government trying to play the politics around drug-testing trials for welfare recipients, legislation that really has a bit of politics in it, some administrative changes and elements that are deeply flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of changes that Labor have been very clear that we're happy to support, if split from other measures in the bill—things like, for example, streamlining tax file number collection and aligning social security and disability discrimination law. They are sensible things and things that we would support. As I think the shadow minister said, they are hardly reform, hardly an amazing reforming government agenda, but they are sensible measures nonetheless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are some really, really important aspects that we will not support. I'd like to draw the attention of the House to those. The first one I would like to bring the House's attention to is abolishing the wife pension. The wife pension is a non-activity-test payment that has been closed to new applicants since 1 July 1995. When you look at this measure, the majority—I understand—will be transferred onto the age pension and carer's payment with a small minority having a cut. I think it says about 2,900 women will be transferred onto the jobseeker payment. These are a number of women who have not worked for a long time. It is pretty mean-spirited of the government to take this very small group of women who have not worked for a long time and say, 'We're going to phase out this payment for you'. It's not a huge amount of money. It really shows this government's callous attitude to anyone receiving an income support payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we also have the other callous measure that has the potential to cut the payments of those receiving a bereavement allowance. This is for those who have lost their partners. It is a short-term payment of 14 weeks. This government has said, 'No, no, no'. It can be longer for a pregnant woman if they lose their partner. Now this government is going to snatch that away from them. Really, this is not welfare reform. This is just being mean-spirited. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one that I really think is not just mean-spirited but shows how out of touch this government is with those looking for a job are the changes to the activity test for people 55 to 59. Currently, people in this age group have to fulfil their activity test to get their Newstart payment by looking for work or volunteering for 30 hours per fortnight. This government is going to say that recipients would need to fulfil their 30 hours per fortnight of activity, but only half of that can be voluntary work. The rest of the time, they've got to go out and look for work. That's a nice concept. If the government has ever spoken to anyone between the ages of 55 and 59, trying to find work out there, they would know that these are not bludgers. These are not people flouting the system and deliberately trying to escape their requirements. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to so many who have found themselves in a situation where they've been made redundant, lost their job or been only able to achieve part-time work. They desperately want to work more and no-one will employ them. This comment comes to me time and time again. In fact, I have had older Australians looking for work say that they first put their resume in with their age and they get no interviews. So they think: 'Well, okay. I'm going to put my resume in without my age.' They get an interview but do not get the job. One could only suggest that it is down to what I believe is significant age discrimination when it comes to workplace employment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the real life experience of those older Australians desperately looking for work. The government says, 'Go and retrain'. They go back and retrain and they still can't get work. This government says to them, 'Look, you're finding it difficult to get a job.' They may then find a voluntary organisation that they feel passionate about, giving them 30 hours a fortnight. The government says: 'No, that's not good enough for the activity test. You've got to go and put yourself through the ringer time and time again. You can only do half of that work voluntarily. For the other half, you've got to keep turning up to interviews and keep getting rejections over and over and over again.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You know what? The government does not understand how demoralising that is for people—how demoralising it is for people just turning up and putting their resume in over and over again. All they can say is, 'I've got the skills, I've got the passion and I want to work, but guess what: they just won't employ me.' This is something I hear from older Australians over and over again. So this measure to ensure that 55- to 59-year-olds cannot achieve their activity test by volunteering, once again, is just so mean spirited. It really shows that the government does not understand what the reality is out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to be facing this in South Australia soon. We have so many people that are going to find themselves redundant with the closure of Holden—not just those directly working at Holden but also those working in manufacturing and industries associated with the automotive industry. I tell you: some of those people have given 20, 30 or 40 years of loyal service, and they still want to work after this. But it is going to be hard for them to find jobs, and really this government, through this measure, just shows that it has no concept whatsoever of the age discrimination that older Australians face going back into the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it's the bereavement allowance, the wife pension or cutting the number of voluntary hours that count for your activity test, this is not reform. This is just mean-spirited picking on vulnerable people and trying to make out that they are somehow stealing from the taxpayer when, indeed, what they are asking for is just a little bit of support, and you want to rip that away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish my comments with the drug trials proposed in this piece of legislation. This is to pick welfare recipients and put them through a trial of drug testing and then change their payments or their access to payments as a result. When it comes to legislation and good public policy, we know that, when you put in a policy, you should have an outcome in mind. One would assume that any policy around drug and alcohol testing would be designed to try and minimise drug and alcohol use. That's what you'd think the outcome would be. Well, we know the measure before the House today will do nothing whatsoever to tackle addiction in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drug and alcohol addiction is a powerful, powerful thing. It is a medical issue that needs to be tackled properly in a medical way. We also know that you need to be ready and have the capacity to deal with that addiction. Being made homeless and desperate is not going to put you in a frame of mind to tackle your addiction. It's not just me and it's not just Labor; there is a list of bodies, which many of my colleagues have gone through before, from the AMA to every addiction organisation to ACOSS, all saying that this measure will not work. It will not do what the government claims it will do—that is, reduce drug addiction and alcohol abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am the first one to want to tackle the scourge of addiction in our community. I am the first one to say, 'Let's make sure that we give all the support and resources to those that want to make their lives better by tackling their addiction and their drug and alcohol dependency.' But you don't do that with a punitive measure with no drug and alcohol treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I found astounding is the admission from the government that they hadn't even checked what services for drug and alcohol treatment were available in the trial sites. You would think that, if there were going to be some sort of program to tackle drug and alcohol addiction through cutting people's payments, they'd say, 'Well, let's do it in a place where there are actually some services where people who want to get help can get help.' But they did not even check that. They did not even look at that critical piece of information, which brings me back to the point where I started: this drug and alcohol trial is condemned by medical professionals. It's condemned by those representing many vulnerable and disadvantaged people. It hasn't worked overseas, and many of my colleagues have gone through that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is a fundamental question before the House: why is this legislation being introduced when it's not going to work? The only answer I can come up with is politics. The government is divided and desperate. It has a weak Prime Minister. He is a Prime Minister who can barely hold his party together, who's being attacked by the Left and by the Right of his party. He is so fundamentally weak that he cannot do anything except play politics with vulnerable people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to rethink this damaging policy, this policy that will not work, this policy that's all about politics. Be a better government. Govern in the interest of Australians and not this rank political agenda that is desperately being used to try to hold the Right and the Left together.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  This so-called welfare reform bill, as we've just heard from the member for Kingston, is really about the government trying to play politics. It's really about the government trying to pick on vulnerable people. You would have thought that they'd had enough of that, because they have tried much of this before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three measures in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 that I am particularly concerned about and that I want to talk about today. Similarly to the previous member, I am particularly concerned about the change in the activity test for 55- to 59-year olds. People would know that at the moment people over the age of 55 who are out of work and are receiving Newstart can go and volunteer for 30 hours per week. That's 30 hours per week in which they are going out in their own time—paying for it themselves, often with transport—to get to their volunteer posts out and about in the community, to do good things supporting other vulnerable people, and this government wants to penalise them. It is just astounding. You would think it would be a sensible measure if, indeed, there were jobs out there for over-55-year-olds but there aren't. We have heard from many on this side the concerns around that and age discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been holding forums around the country with older Australians as part of my shadow portfolio duties, and one of the things that are raised with me every single time is the discrimination that older Australians face when trying to get work. The report <span style="font-style:italic;">Willing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">o Work</span>, put out by the former Age and Disability Discrimination Commissioner Susan Ryan, says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The right to work, free from discrimination on any basis, is a fundamental human right. Too many older Australians … are denied this right and as a result are prevented from enjoying the independence, dignity and sense of purpose that work brings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, in Australia today this is still true. The report is only a year and a half old. It clearly shows the discrimination that older Australians face when trying to seek work. Many of these older Australians have been employed for most of their life. Indeed, many of them have been made redundant after years and years of work in the same job and then need to reskill. First, those reskilling programs are not available for most people and, second, it is so hard for these people to re-enter the workforce, yet when they're out there volunteering, trying to support other members in the community, the government is trying to penalise them. I do not understand where the government is coming from on this. The age discrimination commissioner's report says their survey found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… 27% of people over the age of 50 had recently experienced discrimination in the workplace. One third of the most recent episodes of discrimination reported occurred when applying for a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They go in, they put in their resumes and their CVs and they get knocked back. They continually get knocked back on the basis of their age, even though that is not what they are told. Many of them, as you heard from the member for Kingston, don't even put their age on their CVs or resumes anymore, because they know that they will be discriminated against because of their age. And this government wants to penalise them even further. So I am really concerned about this aspect of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of the bill that I am concerned about is in regard to the demerit provisions for Newstart jobseekers and the way in which they will work. I am particularly concerned that the government has removed the ability of employment service providers and, indeed, Centrelink to use their discretion and to waive demerits when there are exceptional circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen this government try to move this bill two or three times before, and we've had to knock it off two or three times before because, of course, we know that doing things like that only leads to more homelessness. It only leads to more issues in the community because the people that the government is talking about penalising are already extremely vulnerable. And the government has no evidence that cutting more people off welfare or Newstart payments is actually going to improve their ability to find a job. What it actually wants to do is disengage people and not use its discretion for waivers when people are really vulnerable. I'm really concerned that this will actually have adverse impacts on those vulnerable members of our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third part of the bill that I wanted to talk about today is of course the one that has been raised so many times in this place, and that is about the drug testing of welfare recipients in those trial sites. We've heard from so many experts, from the AMA to ACOSS, that this will not work. We've got no evidence from the government that this will work and, indeed, all the evidence from overseas would suggest that it won't work. We've also heard, unfortunately, that the government yet again hasn't done its homework. The government hasn't done its homework in terms of what services are available for those people whose tests do come up positive to say that, yes, there is alcohol or drug addiction. Indeed, has this government actually put in more support services in those trial sites? What are the waiting lists already for those people in those trial sites when it comes to seeking support for their addictions today?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite unusually for the government, they of course are making a hash of this just like they do everything else. They cannot implement any policy without mucking it up. We see it time and time again. We see it with this welfare reform bill; we saw it with the NBN; we saw it with the census; and we're going to see it, no doubt, with the household survey. They cannot organise anything. We've had minister after minister come in here and try to do more and more welfare reform that just leaves more and more people vulnerable. Quite frankly, I've had enough of it and my constituents have enough of it. It's about time the government stopped picking on vulnerable people and actually got on and did their job properly, because people out there in our communities know that there are not enough jobs for every jobseeker. They've got to stop picking on vulnerable jobseekers, go out there and create more jobs with less underemployment and less casualisation of the labour force. They need to improve wages growth. Indeed, they've got a lot of work to do, and this welfare reform bill doesn't do any of that. All it does is continually pick on vulnerable people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="208884" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PORTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I thank all the members, including those opposite, for their contributions to the debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. By way of summing up the second reading debate, I note that the bill simplifies the welfare system. It strengthens conditionality for jobseekers, particularly those with drug and alcohol issues, and it introduces a new targeted and workable compliance framework. The point of the simplification—and I do note that the member for Jagajaga is here, thank her for her presence and also note that in her Growing Together manifesto it was said by Labor that consideration should be given to simplifying the working-age payment system. Of course, that wasn't done under the period of the previous government, but now we have before parliament a plan which is to simplify the welfare system in a very substantive way. I might deal with those three issues—complexity, mutual obligation and the compliance framework—separately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to complexity, we know we have a very complex welfare system. This bill seeks to turn seven payments into one to create a new jobseeker payment, so from 20 March 2020 the bill would introduce a new single jobseeker payment which would replace the seven existing payments as the main payment for people of working age. These changes would ensure a single set of rules and rates for people of working age with the capacity to work and aim to firmly entrench employment as the desired outcome for Australians who seek the jobseeker payment. That is a very significant simplification reform. In fact, given its scale, it's interesting that only two issues really have been raised with respect to consolidating seven payments into one. Those relate to two payments: bereavement allowance and the wife pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the member for Mayo. In her speech on the second reading she did raise a genuine issue with respect to the potential for pregnant women receiving bereavement allowance to spend longer than 14 weeks on the payment and therefore be financially worse off under the proposed arrangements. Again I thank her for raising that issue and speaking to me separately about it. We realise that that's a special category and will continue to work with her and the Nick Xenophon Team on that particular issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue relates to what are effectively 200 wife pensioners who reside overseas and would no longer be eligible for the wife pension from a future point in time. Those individuals are presently aged between 45 and 62. Where they don't reside in a country with an international agreement, like every single other person in the welfare system that is able to work they would not be eligible to be continually funded by the taxpayer while they're overseas. That payment as it presently exists simply does not reflect community values, and it shouldn't be continued after 22 years so that we support able Australians to live overseas and never look for work even though they are of working age. That would maintain a range of existing inequities in the social security system. It reinforces outdated social norms and it would do a huge disservice to the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the issue of mutual obligations, again this is very significant reform. Most complaints from members opposite related to the changes to the activity test for persons aged between 55 and 59. The bill will also strengthen the employment focus of mutual obligations and better target mature-aged jobseekers with the labour market. Labor's criticism of the measure to increase the activity requirements for those aged between 55 and 59 is twofold. There are two criticisms: first, somehow this change is unfair or not in the best interests of those people aged between 55 and 59, and, second, it could affect rates of volunteering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the situation is that neither of those criticisms is correct. There is a central question of principle here. As a government, we take the view that jobseekers aged between 55 and 59 are not going to benefit from being totally excused from any effort to prepare for or search for work. In fact, the contrary idea—that it is actually in a person's interest to be in a system that requires some effort to search for work—is supported by many sources. The Department of Employment's data shows that, in the year ending December 2016, over all age groups, 32.4 per cent of jobseekers who participated in voluntary work were in employment three months later. Comparatively, 48.5 per cent of jobseekers who participated in jobactive were in employment three months later. Reputable data also exists to show that mature-aged people are 13 times more likely to find work when actively looking for it. Critically, alongside this reform is the fact that the government is investing over $110 million in mature-aged re-skilling packages to help older Australians retain and find work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also rejects the argument that the reforms for the 55 to 59 age bracket would see volunteer groups somehow lose volunteers. In claiming a negative impact on volunteering, members opposite continually and conveniently ignore the fact that, of the 40,000 jobseekers aged 55 to 59, only around 7½ thousand presently use volunteering alone to meet their 30 hours of activity. Also, of course, members opposite ignored the fact that our reforms will, for the first time, require that 45,000 jobseekers aged over 60 will have some mutual obligations, where at present there are none, and be required to undertake 10 hours of activity per fortnight, all of which could be met through volunteering. That means a boost to the volunteering sector by providing a net increase of up to 337,000 volunteering hours a fortnight. How can it be considered a disadvantage to volunteering groups when it could provide up to 337,000 hours more volunteering a fortnight?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also contains changes for faster connection to employment services. From 1 January 2018, the bill will encourage jobseekers to connect more quickly with their employment service providers. Some members opposite have raised concerns on how this measure would impact on jobseekers in rural and remote areas. Again, the fact is that, under current arrangements, jobseekers in regional areas are exempt from RapidConnect where transport would not allow attendance at their initial appointment in a timely manner, and that safeguard remains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some issues were raised with respect to the removal of intent-to-claim provisions. Under this bill, the social security claimants would receive payments from the date they provide all material necessary to be assessed that is within their control, rather than from the date of first contact with the Department of Human Services expressing an intention to claim. That is opposed by Labor, but the fact is that, at present, an applicant can provide only their name and the payment which they intend to claim and be back paid to the date that they first made contact with the department. This arrangement simply does not align with community expectations and, again, does a massive disservice to the taxpayer. It is simply not an unreasonable request for applicants to provide the very basic required information when lodging a claim. This measure will improve the integrity and administrative complexity of the welfare system, and, again, adequate provisions and exemptions exist for people who do not have the ability to provide all relevant documents, including those who may be disabled or live in remote areas and those who are homeless or affected by domestic violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, under the heading of strengthening mutual obligation requirements, deals with a range of substance abuse measures. It introduces three measures to strengthen requirements for jobseekers with substance abuse issues and provides improved pathways for them to pursue appropriate treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the bill establishes a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 recipients of Newstart and youth allowance from 1 January 2018. Members opposite oppose this trial, doing so on the basis that they say there is no evidence that it's guaranteed to work. Of course, the first point is that this position ignores the fact that it is a trial, designed to determine whether the welfare system can be effectively used to compel people into treatment. Further, that is the same argument that has been run against the cashless welfare card and against the No Jab, No Pay immunisation policy to link vaccination to family tax benefit payments, and yet both of those policies have proven very substantial and successful in changing behaviours and improving individual lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exact reason that there is no evidentiary guarantee for a trial like this, or that it will work, is that it has never been done before in the way that we are doing it. Despite multiple false statements by members opposite, this trial will not cut people off from income support if they test positive for drugs. It is very different in that respect to the trials that have been conducted overseas. Instead, after a first test, our trial will limit the amount of income support that is provided in cash and, following a second positive test, it refers the individual to a doctor for an assessment on what treatment may be required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the member for Barton typified the opposition's position in opposing this in her second reading contribution. She said that the trial won't work because, 'this requires a medical response'. Of course, a medical response is exactly what we are proposing. Every decision regarding treatment will be made by a qualified medical professional, paid for and provided by the government. The member for Barton also gave Labor's objection to the trial on the basis that income management was described as not being an effective tool to help people with substance abuse problems. Indeed, what I think was revealed in several contributions from members opposite was an equal opposition to the trial as to the consequences of a positive drug test being income management.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say to the member for Jagajaga that I share her views where she noted that income management is a useful and important tool for protecting vulnerable people—particularly for protecting children. It makes sure that welfare payments are spent on the essentials of life—things like food, clothing and rent—and not on alcohol or drugs. The Labor position also conveniently ignores the considerable body of evidence that exists around the effectiveness of compelling people into drug treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for trialling a new approach where there is not an evidentiary guarantee of success is to trial, test and learn. Equally, the fact that there may not be a guarantee of success is distinct from a lack of evidence to suggest that the trial of a new approach could reasonably be considered worthwhile. I worked in drug courts and, in fact, much of what we have done is based on the process there. Drug courts, of course, effectively mandate treatment and they have been very successful in mandating treatment for drug and alcohol problems. The data and evidence shows that this type of compulsion for treatment can be very effective. The Magistrates Early Referral Into Treatment Program—the MERIT Program—in New South Wales has resulted in the number of people in employment rising from 20 per cent at program entry to 27.5 per cent at exit. The Victorian Drug Court had a study which showed that 79 per cent of people appearing before it were unemployed. It showed that the benefits of the drug treatment compulsory order program included improved health and wellbeing, reductions in drug and alcohol risk and enhanced employment prospects and overarching life skills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A 2008 study published by the Crime and Misconduct Commission in Queensland examined the issue of mandatory versus voluntary treatment for drug and alcohol problems. It concluded as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our findings do not support the current treatment philosophy of waiting for people with drug and/or alcohol abuse problems to get themselves psychologically motivated and prove their readiness to receive treatment. On the contrary, the findings indicate that mandatory treatment seems a promising option to help offenders with drug and alcohol abuse problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This trial has been developed to test whether the welfare system can be used in a similar way to drug courts. If it does not work, of course there will be a need to try something else. If it does work, we will have improved the lives of people with those drug problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two other measures in this bill also ensure that jobseekers with substance abuse issues remain actively engaged in appropriate activities, including treatment to address their barriers to work rather than being exempt from all mutual obligation requirements. From 1 January 2018, jobseekers will no longer be exempt from their mutual obligation or participation requirements if the reason they are unable to meet their obligations is predominantly due to drug or alcohol dependency. From 1 January 2018, the government will also tighten the reasonable excuse rules to allow for the closing of a loophole so that alcohol and drug dependency will not be accepted as a reasonable excuse for not meeting obligations when the jobseekers are not also actively engaged in treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, Labor sought to characterise these changes as punitive, but what they failed to point out or to mention is that this change is accompanied by, and will run parallel to, one of the most important changes in this reform package—that is that for the first time all jobseekers will be able to have drug and alcohol treatment efforts count towards their mutual obligation requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental principle the government reforms embody is simply this: citizens who are receiving taxpayer funds in the form of welfare benefits should not be able to claim drug and alcohol abuse as a reason for failing to undertake critical mutual obligations like turning up to job interviews unless they are also making reasonable efforts to undertake treatment or support for the problem. The system as it currently stands fails to detect people with drug problems and simply allows those it does not know about to be exempt from all mutual obligations. The purpose of all these measures is to ensure that, when people have substance abuse issues that are acting as a barrier to their employment, they are compelled into appropriate treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the compliance framework, from 1 July 2018, a new jobseeker compliance framework will provide more support to those who are genuinely trying to meet their obligations whilst also introducing fairer and more contemporary penalties for the very small number of jobseekers who persistently and deliberately do not meet their requirements. The Labor Party called for the reinstatement of waivers and provider discretion, but that is the exact reason the present system is failing. The failure of the current waiver arrangements and the inconsistency in the use of discretion has made our proposed changes completely necessary. Under the framework, at present, 93 per cent of penalties for serious or persistent noncompliance are waived. This means there is no consequence for the overwhelming majority of jobseekers who repeatedly fail to meet their requirements or who refuse an offer of suitable work. Penalties only apply to those who repeatedly fail, with multiple barrier assessments and warnings before this could occur. Reasonable excuse provisions will of course continue to apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to information management, I would also note briefly that the bill eliminates the requirement for the Department of Human Services to obtain information twice. It streamlines prosecution processes and reduces the administrative burden of criminal investigations. These changes do align with the Department of Human Services information-gathering powers and align it with that of other agencies at the Commonwealth and state and territory levels. The changes retain the common-law right to silence, preventing use of information or documents against the person that provided them other than in proceedings for the provision of false information. This exception is consistent with the guide to framing Commonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement that states that the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply where it is alleged a person has given false or misleading information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, it is critical to ensure that our welfare system is efficient, effective and sustainable into the future. We simply cannot afford a set-and-forget approach to the welfare system. It is for those reasons that I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. Labor will support the bill in the House. We understand the government will make an amendment as agreed with Labor. The immigration and border force portfolio is a very complex and dynamic remit with many areas integral to the integrity, security, prosperity and safety of this country. It includes stronger borders, preventing people smugglers and stopping deaths at sea—areas of policy Labor is strongly committed to—as well as the visa system, skilled migration, customs, the administration and collection of tariffs, travel, tourism and many more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given these broad portfolio matters, the issue of transparency and accountability in the work undertaken by the department, staff, contractors and service providers is absolutely critical. It is especially important to the trust that Australians have in the integrity of our immigration and humanitarian programs. The Department of Immigration and the Australian Customs and Border and Protection Service merged in 2015 to become the current department with its operational arm being the Australian Border Force. Given this merger, the secrecy and disclosure provisions in part 6 of the legislation then covering Border Force were adapted from the now repealed Customs Administration Act into the new legislation. At the time, Labor supported the ABF Act, inclusive of part 6. Since 2015, there has been both confusion and criticism with part 6 of the ABF Act—about what information is protected and what information can be disclosed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABF Act, as currently written, essentially protects all information, which has led to a lack of disclosure of information by concerned individuals and stakeholders. Some stakeholders refer to the 'chilling effect' the act has on the public disclosure of information. The appropriateness of this, and concerns raised by stakeholders about an inability to disclose any information, was one of the main driving forces behind Labor including an examination of part 6 of the act in the terms of reference of the recent Senate inquiry into serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of asylum seekers in the Nauru regional processing centre and similar allegations in the Manus regional processing centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to clarify any real or perceived confusion about whether information is or is not protected. Labor agrees people should have the right to disclose non-sensitive information where appropriate and when required. Given this, we welcome the legislation before the chamber today. The practical application of this bill is to more narrowly define information that is protected from disclosure. This narrowing of the definition clarifies people's capacity to disclose non-protected information. It is also important to clarify the matter, given instances in which this information could lead to actions against an individual.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill adds three new permitted purposes for which personal information can be disclosed under the legislation. This includes matters of intercountry adoption, the protection of national security and defence of the country and the location of missing persons, all measures which Labor is very committed to and supports. The legislation amends the ABF Act 2015 in a number of ways. As per the current act, protected information is currently defined as 'information that was obtained by a person in the person's capacity as an entrusted person'. It is a very broad definition and covers all information obtained in the capacity of entrusted person. Under the legislation, that person could be the secretary of the department, the Australian Border Force Commissioner or an Immigration and Border Force Protection worker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendments narrow the scope and change the protected information to a new definition called 'Immigration and Border Protection information'. Subsection 1 of section 4 of the Immigration and Border Protection information includes disclosure that could reasonably be expected to prejudice security, defence or the international relations of Australia such as high-level data and information on human trafficking exchanged with other countries. The next subsection talks about the need to prevent detection and investigation of or conduct of proceedings relating to an offence or a contravention of a civil penalty provision, including information obtained by the interception of communications under a warrant. The next subsection talks about the protection of public health or endangering the life or safety of an individual or group of individuals such as through revealing the biographical details of individuals in witness protection programs. The next subsection deals with disclosure of information 'which would or could reasonably be expected to found an action by a person (other than the Commonwealth) for breach of a duty of confidence'. For example, details of aviation operations which are commercial-in-confidence. The next one talks about disclosure which could cause competitive detriment to a person, including commercially sensitive information about commercial entities such as names of suppliers, prices paid for goods and, finally, anything prescribed under information of a kind prescribed in instrument under subsection (7), which I will refer to later on. In this amendment, the narrowing, I think, is beneficial for public trust and integrity in the system. Of course there are some offences associated with the legislation as well, including unauthorised disclosure of information carrying imprisonment as a punishment for up to two years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The executive memorandum of this bill argues that the amendments are made in terms of these provisions because they are ineffective and reduce operational administrative inefficiencies. Subsection (1) creates a new definition of duty of confidence, immigration and border protection information and intelligence agencies. That is subsection (1) of section 4. The amendments make a difference to public integrity and trust in the system. The new subsection 4(7) I mentioned before creates new powers for the secretary of the department to prescribe the kind of information to be defined as immigration and border protection information by way of a legislative instrument. That legislative instrument is disallowable, and we would agree with that—that is, if the secretary is satisfied that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to prejudice the effective work of the department or otherwise harm public interest. Given the complexities of the immigration and border protection portfolio, it is reasonable that issues may arise because of unforeseen changes in circumstances which make it necessary for information to be protected from disclosure and for that action to be taken quickly. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is not convinced that this power should rest with an unelected public official, albeit someone of the standing of the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. This is a concern that was shared by the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry, Ian Macdonald, who, in the public hearing into this bill said that he felt 'uncomfortable with this power resting with the secretary'. Labor is strongly of the view that the minister should be personally responsible and accountable for any decision to protect from disclosure any additional information that should be covered by this legislation, and which is certainly not covered by the definition. If they are going to add additional information, it should be the minister and not an unelected secretary of the department. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor anticipates that the minister will move an amendment to the legislation before the House today to transfer this responsibility from the secretary to the minister, and Labor will support that amendment. This is not a decision that should be delegated to the department. Labor supports transparency and accountability in immigration and border protection decision-making. The minister should always be accountable and willing to justify any decision to protect from disclosure additional immigration and border protection information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 1 of schedule 1 of the bill will have a retrospective application backdated to 1 July 2015 which should give some comfort to stakeholders and advocates who have spoken about the Turnbull government's failure to manage the immigration and border protection portfolio. This clarifies that only information that would cause identifiable harm if disclosed is to be protected under the ABF Act. The new narrower definition of immigration and border protection information will, I think, reassure individuals who may otherwise erroneously believe that they have committed an offence. I also note that there have been no prosecutions under the current ABF Act for release of protected information. The ABF Act also makes amendments to the Customs legislation and other types of legislation. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the current government in their failures to consult or welcome scrutiny, Labor will always consult with relevant stakeholders, advocates, experts and others when developing policy and legislation, given the potential legislative impact those changes may have on people. With that in mind, we referred this particular bill to a Senate inquiry in relation to it. The Senate inquiry is due to report on 12 September, before the Senate looks at it but after the House will deal with this legislation. Whilst awaiting the final report, we note the 13 submissions that have been received by that Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill. A public hearing was held last Friday.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions made to the Senate inquiry generally welcomed the proposed amendments to the ABF Act to narrow the scope of information which could be protected and to offer greater clarity about the types of information that can be publicly disclosed. The Refugee Advice and Casework Service, commonly known as RACS, confirmed in their submission their support for the bill and said that the bill:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">By substituting 'protected information' with 'Immigration and Border Protection Information', the Bill decriminalises the disclosure of a range of information that may be crucial for avoiding harm.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Commission expressed a view that the proposed amendments are better than the current ABF Act, stating:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">When compared to the current law, it strikes a better balance between recognising the need to protect sensitive government information and the importance of allowing legitimate public scrutiny.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, during the public hearing on Friday, 8 September, Doctors for Refugees provided testimony stating their support for the intent of the bill, despite serious reservation about the provision of health care provided to asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. This includes the willingness of Australian based medical practitioners to speak out about the availability and provision of medical care.</span>

In particular, I draw the House's attention to a submission made by the Australian Information Commissioner which recommends:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the public hearing on this bill, the department confirmed that, in preparing this bill, they did not undertake a privacy impact assessment. This is despite the Information Commissioner, in his submission, arguing:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, the Australian public is all too aware of the failings of this government with respect to the operation of the Immigration and Border Force portfolio. The failures are not different. As in other areas of health and education, there has been report after report from the Auditor-General in relation to the dismal handling of this portfolio in terms of offshore processing and the mismanagement of the department by the current minister and the previous minister. There has been mismanagement of offshore processing and of welfare and garrison support contracts, the subject of two scathing ANAO reports. The government sat on its hands as to negotiating third-country arrangements, particularly for Australian-funded offshore processing centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support the US refugee resettlement deal. We want all eligible refugees to have the opportunity to resettle, including refugees who are currently in Australia for ongoing medical treatment. The government seem to have put all their eggs in one basket with the US resettlement deal, and we urge them to look elsewhere for other third-country arrangements. We have consistently called on the government—in the interests of accountability and transparency, on which they seem to have had a change of heart here—to release details of the US refugee agreement and any side agreement they had in relation to the Costa Rica arrangements. The government have come to the party here. They've made changes in terms of protected information. We urge them to show the same degree of transparency and accountability on the US refugee resettlement deal and the Costa Rica arrangements that the current Prime Minister came to with then President Obama.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want refugees off Manus and Nauru and into third countries as soon as possible, but we will hold the government to account in terms of transparency in the onshore as well as the offshore immigration system. When it comes to their handling of this, the minister and the secretary of the department should always be able to account for and should account for inaction. And that's what happened. The subject of this legislation before the chamber was looked at by the Senate inquiry which I referred to earlier. In September 2016, Labor initiated that inquiry because of the failure of the Turnbull government to act on serious allegations raised in the Nauru files aired by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>. The chair's report, conclusions and recommendations from that Senate inquiry were handed down on 21 April this year. It's been 155 days and counting of complete and utter inaction on those recommendations. During those 155 days, we've seen more and more examples of failure by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection to manage his secretary and the department</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that a 'tick and flick' approach is simply not good enough. I saw that exposed last week with reports that about 2,000 departmental staff were overpaid for leave, and this went unnoticed by the minister for immigration for two years. The minister blamed a systems error for the overpayments while forcing staff into an inflexible repayment scheme owing to his own failure to manage the department. This occurred while morale within the department is said to have collapsed and workers and their representatives, the unions, are still locked in a dispute with the Turnbull government over pay and conditions that's lasted for four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is increasingly concerned about the Turnbull government's failure to manage offshore processing centres and to treat asylum seekers fairly and with dignity. Recently the immigration minister callously cut financial support and housing for asylum seekers transferred from Manus Island and Nauru for medical treatment. There are up to 400 people, potentially, who could be caught up in this decision. The cuts began without warning two weeks ago. In the interests of transparency and accountability and in the spirit of this particular legislation that we've got today, we ask the government not to purposely make people destitute and homeless. The government can only exacerbate health conditions of asylum seekers who were originally transferred to Australia for treatment. The immigration minister has completely failed to make a case as to why these people haven't been allowed to apply for resettlement in the United States while receiving medical treatment in Australia. The long-term issue of these people being in Australia could have been avoided entirely if these eligible refugees had been allowed to apply to be resettled as part of the US refugee resettlement arrangement whilst still living in Australia, as recommended by that Senate inquiry I've referred to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to holding the government to account and to increasing transparency in onshore immigration detention and offshore immigration processing. The bill before the House today eases some of our concerns in relation to these issues, but it's simply not good enough. The government needs to do better—certainly in terms of the provision of medical care to refugees who need it on Manus and Nauru. There've been a number of medical reports of asylum seekers and refugees in regional processing centres experiencing significant delays in the medical transfer process or having their recommended procedures being unavailable on Manus and Nauru. I wrote to the immigration minister to seek an assurance that medical transfers would be available when recommended by medical professionals, including women's rights to reproductive assistance. My letter drew the attention of the minister to recommendations 1 and 2 of that Senate inquiry. I will read them for the record. Recommendation 1 is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, as a matter of urgency, commission an external review of its medical transfer procedures in offshore processing centres. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 2 is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that the Australian Government undertake to seek advice in relation to whether improvements are required to the medical treatment options available to asylum seekers and refugees in the Republic of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, particularly mental health services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I again remind the House that the Turnbull government has yet to respond to these recommendations, and I urge the minister to respond to the Senate recommendations and to read the report and act on those recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pending an anticipated amendment, Labor will support the bill before the House. Labor is committed to improving transparency and accountability, and we want to make sure that appropriate information is protected but that there be adequate disclosure provisions there. It's critical to the trust Australians have in the integrity of our immigration and border protection policies. Given this, we would welcome the amendments we anticipate today, including the narrowing of the definition of information that is protected from disclosure. We will continue to hold the government to account, and I urge the government to respond to the Nauru files Senate inquiry's recommendations and to my letter as soon as possible.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I welcome the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. I welcome it alongside the legal, medical and aid organisations and an organisation in my own community, the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group, who are looking forward to the improvements it will bring to existing law relating to the transparency that we have in Australia's offshore detention system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former journalist, I've been particularly concerned with the Turnbull government's lack of transparency in the operation of offshore detention centres. My community has always been an extremely outspoken one when it comes to issues of refugees and asylum seekers. I've received hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of letters protesting not only the conditions of Australia's offshore detention centres but also the secrecy that the Australian offshore detention regime has been shrouded in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to see that this parliament is taking bipartisan steps—albeit modest ones, by the Law Council's assessment—towards ensuring that Australians know what is happening in offshore detention, that refugees and asylum seekers are afforded freedom of political communication in line with the common and international law that we operate under and that individuals working on Manus and Nauru are able to more freely speak about what they see. This bill tangibly means that individuals who've been involved in Australia's offshore detention system as contractors or employees of the DIBP, such as Save the Children, social workers, psychologists, doctors and lawyers, will generally be able to speak more freely about their experiences and what they've seen with less fear of prosecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill narrows the type of information which, if recorded or disclosed, would make a person liable to prosecution under section 42 of the act. It repeals a very broad phrase, 'protected information', and gives a more precise and specific definition. For instance, it defines that 'information the disclosure of which would or could reasonably be expected to prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia'—such as high-level data and information on human trafficking exchanged with other countries—is covered. It specifies that information 'which would or could reasonably expected to cause competitive detriment to a person', including commercially sensitive information about commercial entities, such as names of suppliers or prices paid for goods, is now defined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill begins to stop the government's total suppression of so-called whistleblowers and staff speaking out about Australia's offshore detention regime, and that is a good thing. The Chairperson of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, Malcolm Evans, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is why we think independent monitoring is so important—transparency is one of the greatest protections here. Where there's a lack of transparency, naturally there will be concerns things are not as they ought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former reporter, I would say transparency is vital, and this is a good step at improving the level of transparency in offshore detention. Under the current legislation, you can't guarantee that whistleblowers would have been spared from retaliation. I'm particularly pleased that the bill has a retrospective commencement date, meaning that those who've spoken out in the past may well fall under the concessions in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government's mismanagement of offshore processing centres and welfare and support contracts has been the subject of two scathing Australian National Audit Office reports, so, clearly, greater transparency is very welcome. My community was outraged, rightly so, at the release of the Nauru files, where 26 former Save the Children workers on Manus and Nauru detailed what they saw and described allegations of sexual assault and self-harm in the Nauru detention centre. One of the workers stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The files, which the government shrouded in secrecy, included reports of genital mutilation against young women, people sewing their lips shut, self-immolation, sexual violence and gross mishandling of incidents by private contractors.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2016, Labor initiated a Senate inquiry to investigate these allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect, because the Turnbull government had failed to act. The government's total inaction for the past 3½ months on the chair's report conclusions and recommendations is extremely disappointing. Let's remember the Australian Border Force Act has previously been used by the Abbott government to attempt to prosecute Save the Children staff after they revealed serious allegations of abuse of women and children. In future, with this amendment, I hope this means that can't happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In looking at the bill before us today, I note that in total, there were 13 submissions to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee Senate inquiry into the bill, generally welcoming the amendments to narrow the scope of information which should be protected and offer greater clarity about the types of information that can be publicly disclosed, a belated step but certainly a step in the right direction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take a moment to talk about the anticipated amendment that has been foreshadowed by the shadow minister—that is, the minister, not the secretary of the department, should have the power to prescribe which information is protected. It should certainly be the case that the minister should be personally responsible and accountable for any decision to protect from disclosure any additional immigration and border protection information not already covered by the definition. We certainly look forward to that amendment being moved and we would support that amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said those things about the bill, there are other things that this issue raises. We must not forget that this government has systematically maligned asylum seekers and refugees and mismanaged offshore processing in Manus Island and Nauru. Whether we liked it or not at the time Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities. They were never meant to be what they've become, a place of indefinite detention, because the government failed to secure third-country resettlement options. No-one in this chamber can possibly feel that people should still be on Nauru and Manus Island four years on. The Prime Minister and immigration minister should be exploring every possible alternative. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that New Zealand Labour leader, Jacinda Ardern, will renew the country's offer to take refugees from Manus Island if she is successful in the election later this month. It is not enough to assume that the US agreement is the sole answer, but this minister has tried to shirk responsibility wherever he can. This is, after all, the minister who said that Australia is 'not responsible' for the hundreds of asylum seekers on Manus Island after the Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court ruled that the detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island is illegal. The minister needs to listen to the UNHCR, which last month said that PNG and Nauru remain unsuitable as places of resettlement, not least because of the lack of medical and psychological services. In fact, it is the provision of medical services that goes to the heart of the concerns my community raises with me—the impact that indefinite detention is having on people. The Blue Mountains branch of Grandmothers Against Detention of Refugee Children have been extremely vocal in fighting for fairness and humanity in our offshore detention centre, as have Justice For Children. I have with me a petition of more than 600 signatures that has gone to the Prime Minister, collected mainly in the Blue Mountains, but from as far afield as Dubbo and Bondi. These grandmothers remind the government that we are signatories to international agreements which need to be respected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another group in my electorate wanting to see more humane treatment of people is the Uniting Church. Members of the Springwood Uniting Church last week sent me a petition addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, expressing their outrage at the minister's decision to withdraw income and accommodation support from up to 370 babies, children, women and male asylum seekers brought to Australia from Nauru and Manus Island on medical grounds. These are some of the most vulnerable people in our community, with more than 20 of the women victims of sexual assault. The minister is making their struggle and their recovery worse by now impoverishing them and making them destitute and homeless. The government's decision to cut financial support and housing to these asylum seekers is a new low, even for them. By purposefully making people destitute, making them homeless, the Turnbull government can only be exacerbating the very health conditions they were originally transferred to Australia to be treated for. I can't fathom why these same people have not been allowed to apply for resettlement in the US. why have they deliberately being excluded from that agreement? The minister has failed to really explain why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage the congregation of Springwood Uniting to keep raising issues like these. The Blue Mountains branches of GetUp! and Amnesty International have also communicated their concerns and have joined the chorus of almost a thousand of my constituents who have taken the time to personally contact me about the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. In fact, the only other issue that has garnered more correspondence in my electorate is the government's mishandling of the National Broadband Network—that speaks volumes for how appalled so many in the community are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People and groups in my community, such as the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group, have been at the forefront of providing assistance to asylum seekers and refugees arriving in Australia. They welcome this amendment to the Australian Border Force Act. The Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group is a group made up of grassroots members of my community who provide practical assistance to those in detention at Villawood and those who are released from detention. They provide financial support to asylum seekers and refugees in our community. They find employment for asylum seekers and they help them find homes. When people are given work rights they often get a job through the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group. They rely on the goodwill of people in the community to assist them to furnish the homes that they find. They provide English lessons and tutors, and they provide friendship and support for a group of people who are often demonised and isolated. They provide lifts to medical appointments, they help them navigate complex government bureaucracy and much more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a refugee cricket team, Oceans 12. One of their matches earlier this year was on Anzac Day, with the Navy cricket team. The comment from the captain of Oceans 12 was that it was strange to be playing cricket against a Defence Force team as most of the players were more used to being afraid of defence forces in their own countries rather than being seen as equals. This is the sort of community building that the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group does, and I'm proud to be a member of it. I will always consult them about amendments to bills and gauge their response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group has welcomed this bill as a good first step in increasing transparency in Australia's offshore detention system. They will continue to fight for fair and humane treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, and I will stand alongside them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="123674" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McGOWAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  I welcome the comments from the member for Macquarie and thank her for the work that she is doing in this parliament. The purpose of the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is to introduce amendments to the 2015 Australian Border Force Act, legislation that sought to stop the unauthorised disclosure of information that could harm the national or public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill. The minister and, in turn, the government are showing that they are listening to the concerns raised by the community and by professionals working in the sector. And they have responded in a positive way to those concerns by addressing the problems raised. I acknowledge the work of the government in doing this and say thank you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are still problem areas, and I ask the minister and the government to bring this same approach to the issues raised in a number of submissions made to the recent Senate inquiry. These issues include that the power to make a legislative instrument should rest with the minister, rather than with the department secretary. I understand that we'll have an amendment to that effect shortly. I note that the government is this afternoon circulating further amendments to the bill, and that these amendments will provide for the minister to make this legislative instrument; I acknowledge that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other recommendations that new provisions and powers introduced in the bill could be used in a way that negates this purpose of distinguishing between information that does or does not need to be kept secret. There is also a provision for an external or independent arbitrator for complaints and breaches of offshore and onshore operations. Later in this speech I will share with this parliament some of the emails from my constituents responding to the pending closure of the regional processing centre in Manus Island in October, and particularly in response to the government's announcement of new visa conditions for those asylum seekers who have been brought to Australia and have been living in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But first I would like to talk briefly to some of the work of Save the Children Australia. They made a number of submissions to the inquiry. Save the Children consider this bill a step in the right direction in decriminalising certain public interest disclosures pertaining to immigration regulation. Save the Children was contracted by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from August 2013 to October 2015 to provide education, recreation, child protection and welfare services to asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru. In the course of providing these services, Save the Children and its employees were subject to the Australian Border Force Act as well as other legislation, such as section 70 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, that criminalise certain disclosures by those contracted to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Save the Children Australia welcomes proposed amendments to the act to allow for lawful disclosure of information in the public interest in Australia. It says it is appropriate for the government to extend confidentiality requirements to organisations contracted to provide services on its behalf. It notes the need for a careful balance between the maintenance of confidential information on the one hand and disclosures where the public interest demand it on the other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Save the Children Australia's note of caution is that the bill introduces some new powers and provisions that could be used in a way that negates their stated purpose of distinguishing between information that does and does not need to be kept secret for legitimate governmental reasons. In particular, it says the delegation of power to the departmental secretary to make an instrument should rest with the minister instead. It argues this broad discretion should be used to prevent the lawful disclosure of a wide range of information, so I welcome the minister's attention to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also refer to the submission made by Rural Australians for Refugees—RAR. Rural Australians for Refugees is a network of groups. They describe themselves as 'everyday people throughout regional Australia aiming to bring about change to the way Australia treats refugees and those seeking asylum'. RAR was formed in 2001 and currently consists of more than 70 groups across all the states and territories. Groups develop activities that suit the strengths of their members and their communities. Some are focused on providing support to newly arrived refugees, as the member for Macquarie has just outlined. Some have chosen community education and awareness programs, while others advocate their concerns to government and the public. Many of the groups do all three.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RAR national president, Marie Sellstrom, is from Mansfield in my electorate. Indeed, there is a strong connection between Indi and the RAR national executive, with the vice president, Ruth Fluhr, coming from the Strathbogie Tableland in North-East Victoria and the secretary, Penny Egan-Vine, coming from Albury-Wodonga. I meet with representatives from local RAR branches and associated networks in Indi on a regular basis, including the convenor of the north-east refugee support network, Freida Andrews, of Benalla, and I thank them all for their ongoing work and representations to my office on behalf of their communities. They are a voice of conscience in my electorate. They call for better communication from the government and immigration authorities. They call for mercy for those who find themselves in such an untenable situation as to need to ask for asylum.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Network members will make a visit to Canberra later this year to plead their case for the support of refugees, and discuss how regional communities can provide their support. I also note that executive members of Rural Australians for Refugees will be in Canberra at Parliament House later this week, and I will be meeting with Marie Sellstrom and RAR national treasurer, Margaret Rasa, on Wednesday morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its inception, RAR members have been increasingly concerned about what they perceive to be a retraction and diminution of accountability by government in the operation of refugees and asylum policies. They note that over the past 15 years members' legitimate questions have been ignored or met with obstruction and/or outright obfuscation in the name of 'security' or 'privacy' or 'client confidentiality' or 'commercial in confidence'. RAR members have also noted an unwillingness on the part of government to account to taxpayers and the ongoing lack of transparency in response to legitimate questions about the conduct and the costs of private contractors. Why do legitimate questions and attempts to obtain information and access sometimes meet with attack?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">RAR says it fully supports the need for special and heightened arrangements to protect Australia's security; however, it does not support the merging of security and secrecy as a means of avoiding security of routine and non-sensitive operational and administrative arrangements. RAR argues that the same standards of accountability that apply generally to the government within our democracy should apply to the operations of refugee and asylum policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">RAR welcomes the government's amendments to the Australian Border Force Act that it says will remove elements unduly constraining democratic access. RAR seeks a strong amendment that would objectively and specifically support improved capacity for external security of Border Force operations. It suggests specific provision for an external and independent arbitrator for complaints and breaches about the onshore and offshore operations conducted by Australian Border Force. RAR also calls for the removal of the special clause providing protection of commercial interests, believing this consideration is unnecessary and instead may lead to perceptions that Border Force operations belong outside of or above normal government commercial arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I join with both Save the Children and RAR in supporting the amendments before the House tonight. I welcome greater transparency and accountability in an area that, for too long, has been shrouded in secrecy. It is this secrecy and the lack of information about the treatment of asylum seekers that my constituents find so distressing—and, as a member of parliament, I too find it distressing. I have spoken previously about how important our laws are, but equally important is recognition that we are a compassionate nation and that we show mercy to those in the most dire of circumstances. Tonight, I call upon the government to show this mercy to the most vulnerable asylum seekers caught up in the crackdown on those who have been brought to Australia from Manus Island and Nauru. The government tells us this is a simple policy designed to stop government payments going to those who don't need them. It says these individuals, assessed on a case-by-case basis by the department, are now on a final departure bridging visa with work rights. I am told it applies only to those well enough to live in the community. But I have had dozens—more than dozens—of emails from constituents who say these asylum seekers and refugees face increasing despair and destitution, as the government attempts to force them back to Manus, Nauru or where they have fled from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I continue to receive feedback from constituents concerned about the closure of Manus Island's regional processing centre at the end of October. To bring one particular example to light, Jill Morton of Bright, who visited Manus and Port Moresby in March, writes: 'Someone needs to stop Australia from dumping these men in PNG. It has become much more unsafe.' She also refers to the recent visit by Senator Nick McKim, and his social media post highlighting the growing number of detainees being transferred from Manus Island to Port Moresby with the understanding that they will not be returned to the detention centre and will be stuck in Port Moresby.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of my constituents are regular visitors to those detained at the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation at Broadmeadows. I specifically refer to Marg and Delfina. They have recently taken fresh fruit to detainees—fresh fruit. From today, 11 September, a new set of guidelines prohibits this. The department says the new rules aim to reduce the risk associated with visitors bringing in food that could compromise safety, security and good order of the immigration facilities. Food must be commercially packaged. It must be consumed during the visiting period and any leftover food must be disposed of at the end of the visit. No-one disagrees with the need for rules, but surely those rules are absolutely extreme. My constituent Marg asks: 'Why is this being done? It appears to be another cruel twist in how these people are being treated.' I agree. I ask the government representative at the table to particularly investigate those rules, follow them through and see if we can do something about making sure fresh food is able to be eaten, distributed and kept.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am heartened, I have to say, by a response in my electorate from the work of the Northern Victoria Refugee Support Network, who have prepared a submission to the inquiry into regional development and decentralisation. They provide arguments, supported by evidence, for decentralising detention, establishing processing centres in rural and regional Australia, developing a coordinated control agency at a statewide level, locating it in a region or a regional area, and successfully integrating refugee communities into rural and regional areas. There's such willingness, there's such a want, and there are such good case studies of refugees coming to rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to continuing to see my community putting their hands up to be part of the solution, and I will not let this issue go. My community will not allow me to let it go. We need to do better, and we must do better. Time is of the essence. I am very pleased that this legislation shows the government has the capacity to change and to do things better. My constituents are telling me that parliament must show leadership. We must represent our regional and rural communities around Australia, and we must bring to parliament their voices, saying: 'Can we demonstrate compassion and support? Can we show how refugee communities can be successfully integrated to build stronger, more resilient communities, particularly in rural areas?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I will continue to advocate for a compassionate and sustainable response by this parliament. In November last year I brought a similar speech to a conclusion by quoting Pope Francis, who noted, 'Frightened citizens build walls on one side and exclude people on the other.' This is not the time for fear and punishment. It is the time for mercy, courage and justice.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I'd like to follow on from the member for Indi and thank her for her contribution in this debate. The support for the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is broad across the parliament because everybody is concerned about making sure that we are a country that accepts people on the legitimacy of their refugee application and that everybody is treated in a just way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions included in this bill that narrow the provisions in the Australian Border Force Act are extremely important in making sure that we get the measures in the law necessary to protect people—particularly vulnerable people at vulnerable stages of life, held in custody or detention by Australian agencies or offshore—and that the policy intent of the provisions set out in the original act are fully realised. They do this by narrowing the provisions to ensure that there are protections and that secrecy or privacy of individuals who are detained is properly protected. But at the same time—as I have raised in a previous public capacity—it is to ensure that information that should be available in the public sphere, particularly around the protection of people and if there are issues around criminal behaviour against individuals, can be properly reported as part of a process to make sure the government, no matter who is in charge and no matter what instrument it is, can be held properly to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provisions in this piece of legislation are relatively straightforward. They narrow the basis of the provisions within sections of the existing act to make sure that it is focused primarily on immigration and border protection information rather than simply protected information, particularly around the conduct of entrusted persons. I think everybody in this place would agree with the broad thrust and focus of this bill for that reason, because it seeks to achieve the original intention of the legislation, rather than going off and doing something different, and to address the concerns that many Australians have and have had in the past. These concerns can now be addressed by narrowing the scope and definition within the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It fits within a much broader package of making sure that this government and this nation meet their expectations and responsibilities around making sure we treat in a fair and just manner people who are seeking protection as a consequence of facing persecution elsewhere in the world. We face a difficult challenge as a consequence of people seeking asylum in Australia, particularly when they arrive through means that aren't the traditional routes recommended to us by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We have to maintain and protect a clear and consistent approach, which allows people to be accepted on the basis of their need and the legitimacy of their application, not on the method or means for their arrival into Australia. At different stages that has been, broadly speaking, a bipartisan approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that at the moment the opposition is continuing to support the government. At other points in recent past they have not done so. I hope they continue to do so, because it is in the best interests of Australians and also because it is in the best interests of those people seeking protection. It is so that they know the direct, honest and straightforward pathway to make it into Australia, rather than trying to circumvent processes to get into Australia by other means.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having spent a lot of time in detention centres as well as refugee camps across the world, I have seen the very real and human consequences of what happens when people seek to arrive in another country through processes and means that may not be consistent with the country that they are seeking to enter, and with which they are prepared to accept. In the end, there are millions of people all around the world who are either displaced or seeking refugee protection as a consequence of the circumstances outside of their control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are one of many countries that takes this issue very seriously. There is a need to be able to provide people with protection as a consequence of those circumstances. We need to have a process and a system that people have confidence in. In countries, particularly in countries like ours, they need to have confidence that people are being accepted on the basis of need and the very real risk of persecution, rather than simply the way they self-identify or make their means or process to get to the country. It must be a just system to continue to preserve confidence so that we can accept people into Australia as refugees. This simple bill around refining the content and the detail within the Australian Border Force Act seeks to achieve that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To follow on from the previous member, I've also had a number of constituents who have continued to raise concerns with me around the operation of Manus Island and the Nauru detention centre and around the conditions that people face. They aim to make sure that they are treated in a fair and just manner. I consistently raise those issues, both in my former capacity and in my current capacity, to make sure people are treated with dignity and respect. I want to stress to all the constituents of the good electorate of Goldstein that this is something that is very much at the fore of the government's mind: making sure that people are treated with dignity and respect, and, in addition, making sure their time in detention is reduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the deal with the United States, to get people off Manus Island and Nauru, has been secured: to try and minimise the time people are held in offshore detention. Those people are able to move on with their lives. It's obviously in their interests, because it gives them the opportunity to realise what they were always seeking—to live a life free from persecution—and then to be able to go on and do it in an environment where they are able to live out their hopes and their dreams. This provides the opportunity for the formation of a family and to be able to secure work and opportunity. That should always be the objective when people are facing persecution: not just to protect them and make them safe but to provide them with foundations and opportunity for them to be able to get on with their lives, as we would hope for our fellow citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a long and difficult process, but it continues to be the objective of this government. In addition, it is very much in our national interest to do so. While we are being very supportive and generous to tens of thousands of people who come to Australia as refugees by providing them with support and assistance, there is no national interest on our part in holding people in detention any longer than necessary. When it comes down to it, we need people to move on with their lives as part of the package to maintain a strong protection for border security that the Australian people and the government have confidence in. We equally want people who are in detention centres to spend as little time there as possible. It's obviously financially beneficial to everybody but, more importantly, it's about people being able to move on with their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If there are problems associated with that, we must be free, within the context and while respecting the privacy of individual people, to provide information that's appropriate in the public domain, because the government always needs to be held to account. As someone who has had a longstanding advocacy in this space, as well as holding government to account more generally, I am always cautious about any measure that limits the capacity for information to be reported about government. That's not a partisan point, whether the Liberals, Labor or anyone else is in office. That's a point of principle—in fact, it goes to one of the core reasons I am a Liberal. Whenever you have centralised power, no matter who is in the position to exercise it, we pose the risk that people may choose to limit the information that is freely available to the advancement and the protection of the interests of those in positions of power and responsibility. In many cases, that's at the core of why people flee from countries—because they experience persecution in the first place. That's why this bill and this provision seeks to clarify what has been longstanding practice under the existing bill—to clarify it for everybody so it will continue to operate into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is one that seeks to be a realisation of government aspiration and policy around refugees, and at the same time makes sure that government can be appropriately held to account for its conduct, no matter who is in office, so that all Australians can look to their government with confidence that they are doing the best, the noble and the humanitarian thing.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Goldstein in this debate on the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. National security—the defence of a nation's borders and the protection of its citizens—has been a core responsibility of sovereign governments since the rise of nation states. Even earlier, the protection of peoples and the resources that sustained them was a cornerstone responsibility for those forms of government that preceded the modern state. And so it remains for the Turnbull government—this national government—in this extraordinary era of sweeping change and global turbulence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the task of maintaining our national security is even more complex and more demanding of vigilance and specialist skills than ever before. There are more people on the move right now, globally, across national borders, searching for everything from permanent resettlement either with or without controlled parameters to travel for brief periods for business, for pleasure and maybe even for mischief, than at any other time in human history. Technological change is speeding up every aspect of that intermingling, together with the immense tensions it creates. This is one of the great global challenges of the 21st century, and we have to keep up. We have to be prepared and we have to ensure that, as new challenges emerge, we are alert enough and flexible enough to reorganise and refine our capability and systems to keep Australia safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this bill, the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017, is before the House today. It is also why the Turnbull government is undertaking the most significant reform of Australia's national intelligence and domestic security arrangements in 40 years, as announced by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice just two months ago, following a review of Australia's intelligence community ordered by the Prime Minister only last year. This review is a big part of that process of keeping up with an ever-changing security landscape and is so desperately important if we are to take the protection of our citizens and defence of our way of life seriously as a first priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review highlighted how changing security threats and technologies are driving the need for closer cooperation and improved vigilance between and by our domestic security and law enforcement agencies, against a backdrop, it needs to be emphasised, of stellar performance from all of those agencies to date in maintaining our national security. Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have successfully intercepted 12 imminent terrorist risks since September 2014. Operation Sovereign Borders has prevented successful people-smuggling ventures for nearly three years. Yet the government remains deeply mindful of the need to reorganise and to refine our efforts whenever compelling advice suggests it is needed to maintain our security at levels that meet the needs and expectations of Australians. Another major result of that review has been the decision to establish an Office of National Intelligence and to transform the Australian Signals Directorate into a statutory agency within the Defence portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also, as part of the same batch of reforms, establish a home affairs portfolio—a portfolio of immigration, border protection and domestic security and law enforcement agencies—such that there will be an effective federation of agencies, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier in the year, in the May budget, the government announced a program worth nearly $60 million to enhance technology that stores biometric data—involving, especially, facial recognition and fingerprints—so that security at points of entry to Australia, especially at our international airports is enhanced. This is crucial national security work, given that an extraordinary 700,000 people arrive in and depart from Australia every week. Yet another major investment is almost $100 million, announced in the 2016 budget, to enhance, again principally through investment in technology, our visa application processes to provide us with enhanced risk assessment of applicants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A major and very important challenge in this ongoing and evolving effort to keep the country safe is, of course, to ensure that measures are fair and reasonable in their impact and application on the vast majority of decent, honest, law-abiding people. People who cherish the rule of law and the rights we all enjoy, people who hope to enjoy those rights and freedoms by joining our Australian community or people simply visiting Australia from overseas for legitimate business or pleasure—they all deserve to be treated civilly and fairly by our laws and those who enforce them. This is a finely tuned and seriously considered balancing act, where individual freedoms are respected while at the same time our national security regime is robust, innovative and capable, and as comprehensively alert to all threats as it can be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Information gathering by our security agencies—from individuals, from industry, from other sectors of government, from foreign agencies, from partners—to ensure mutual national security is obviously a key factor, a central factor, in enabling those agencies to keep us safe. Some of that information is highly sensitive and must be carefully managed. We have to ensure that it is only used or disclosed for legitimate purposes. The danger inherent in the mishandling or the leaking of information with the potential for significant damage to our national security, public safety and law enforcement is obvious. In the act being amended here, the penalty for that sort of breach was two years in prison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a more personal level, individuals can obviously suffer serious detriment where personal and sensitive information is inappropriately disclosed. Other information may be less sensitive and more appropriate to disclose in an open, democratic society while at the same time we deal effectively with critical threats. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 clarifies the secrecy and disclosure provisions in the Australian Border Protection Act 2015 with retrospective application to reflect the policy intent of those provisions which was, and is, to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest—what is known as 'identifiable harm'. The bill makes clear that the definition of information to be protected includes only certain kinds of information such as that relating to the security, defence and international relations of Australia; the prevention, detection and investigation of offences; the protection of public health and safety; or sensitive personal and commercial matters. This narrowing of the definition with retrospectivity will reassure individuals who may otherwise erroneously believe they have committed an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill maintains provisions making it an offence to record or disclose information obtained by a person in their capacity as an entrusted person. That includes people employed by the department either directly or via some form of contracted service. The unauthorised disclosure of information by these people will continue to be punishable by two years imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions were originally adapted from the model in place for the former Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, which were reflected in the Customs Administration Act 1985, but that model has not kept pace with developments that have so deeply influenced the increasingly complex and interconnected world we now live in. There was no internet then. Terrorism existed, but on nowhere near the scale that we see today. Freedom of rapid movement around the globe, especially of air travel, was in its relative infancy, given the vast numbers travelling today. There were millions of refugees, but their numbers were nowhere close to those of today, which measure in the tens of millions—managing that flood has been a significant border security issue here and for many other countries and, indeed, whole continents around the world. It was certainly a very different world in 1985.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These provisions are reasonable, necessary and proportionate for providing assurance to the Australian public, to business, to industry and to government partners in Australia and abroad that information provided to Australian authorities will be appropriately handled, to ensure a strong border protection regime. That is in the interest of all Australians and it is also in the interest of the many visitors to our shores. It is for that reason that I am happy to commend the bill to the House.</span>

The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 clarifies part 6 and related provisions to reflect the original intent of the legislation, which was to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest. The aim of the measure in this bill is to ensure that immigration and border protection information is provided with the necessary level of protection in a targeted manner but also is able to be disclosed went it is appropriate to do so. This bill provides assurances for the Australian public, business, government and foreign partners that sensitive information provided to the department of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection will be appropriately protected without unnecessarily restricting informed public debate. The retrospective application of the bill, back to the date of the Australian Border Force Act that was enacted in 2015, will provide the necessary certainty that only information which would harm the national public interest if disclosed is to be protected and will be regarded as ever having been protected under the ABF Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Border Force Act 2015 provides the regime administering the secrecy and disclosure of information set out in part 6. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 updates these secrecy and disclosure provisions. In particular, it proposes to repeal the definition of 'protected information', which currently covers any information obtained in a person's capacity as an entrusted person, and to substitute a new definition of 'immigration and border protection information'. Under the new definition of 'immigration and border protection information', only specific kinds of information would be covered by the secrecy and disclosure regime. It would be an offence to disclosure or make a record of such information, which is punishable by imprisonment for two years, but which may be identified in the future and which may require protection.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such information may require protection more quickly than an amendment to the Australian Border Force Act 2015 would permit. Therefore, the bill includes a new power that would enable the secretary of the department to prescribe additional kinds of 'immigration and border protection information' by legislative instrument. This would enable a swift response to the need to protect information that is not one of the other kinds of information set out in the new definition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is currently the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. Questions have been raised in submissions to this inquiry and at the public hearing on the bill in relation to the secretary's power to prescribe additional kinds of information. As this has the potential to widen the application of the offence provision concerns have been raised that this power should not be exercised by an unelected public official. To address these concerns, the government proposes to amend this power so that it can only be exercised by the minister, and not the secretary. As the instrument prescribing new kinds of information is a legislative instrument, it will be subject to scrutiny by both houses of parliament and may be subject to disallowance.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOWEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  Here we have a government, which lectures the Australian people about the need for budget repair. They used to talk about a debt and deficit disaster and a budget emergency. Here we have a government bringing to this house legislation which is the single biggest hit to the budget bottom line we have seen in this term or in the last term. This government is proposing to the House a measure which will materially, significantly and structurally damage the federal budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the government's corporate tax cut. We know that this is an expensive piece of legislation because we asked about it in parliament earlier this year, and we would have thought the Prime Minister knew how much this measure would cost over the decade, but it took some considerable effort to get it out of the government. Remember 12 months ago when they announced this; they announced a big 10-year corporate tax cut plan but they couldn't tell us the 10 year cost. But 12 months later it was deja vu all over again, because we asked the Prime Minister in question time what was the new 10-year cost, given that we're in a new fiscal year, and in scenes which were reminiscent of a farce, the government engaged in four different figures in the space of just four answers in question time. We had $24 billion, $26 billion, $36 billion and $56 billion. Eventually we got the right answer and the Treasurer replied with $65.4 billion. I did say to the Leader of the Opposition: 'Stop asking the question, because it's getting more expensive every time. The nation can't afford this!' The nation can't afford this hit to the budget bottom line that this government is so intent on producing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government's mantra is jobs and growth. They say this is the key part of their economic plan, even though it's being introduced now, some considerable time after it was first announced. In fact, it was introduced in May in this House and is only being debated now. But, of course, they are a one-trick pony. When it comes to economic growth, this is all they've got. Their one shot in the locker is the corporate tax cut. It's what they've got. It's all they've got. It's a one-point plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that one-point plan deliver? It delivers a one per cent bigger economy in 20 years time—by their own figures, not by my figures, not by analysis or by any other independent commentator. It is a one per cent increase in 20 years time and a $2-a-day increase in wages in 20 years time. At a time when wages growth has flatlined at record lows and in real terms has gone backwards, the government's big idea is a wage increase in 20 years time of $2 a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic data recently released showed that living standards continued to decline and went backwards in the last quarter. This, again, is the government's big answer to the cocktail of rising costs, electricity prices, stalling wages growth and record underemployment. They say: 'It's okay. We have a plan. It'll work in 20 years time.' We also have a government which is supporting cuts to penalty rates from 1 July this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, this is despite all the lecturing about tax cuts and the Treasurer getting himself in a lather, getting himself very angry every question time, I must say, about Labor's plans on tax. This is a government which is actually proposing in separate legislation to increase the tax burden on every working Australian who earns more than $21,000. So this isn't a government which believes in lower tax; it's a government which believes in different tax. It's a government which believes in lower tax for big business but higher tax for working Australians. There are two pieces of legislation before the House as we speak. The minister at the table says, 'We want lower taxes.' You are trying to increase them. You are trying to increase them on working Australians who earn more than $21,000, and we oppose that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We actually would support legislation which would see a proper approach to these matters, but we've got the government lecturing people about tax when they are increasing the tax rate on working Australians. Every single Australian who earns more than $21,000 will pay more in tax if this government gets its way. A worker on $55,000 will pay $275 a year. For somebody on $80,000 it's an extra $400. So this is not a government which believes in lower tax; it is a government which believes in different tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course we need to have a view to the competitiveness of our tax rates. The tax rates are one thing which goes into investment decisions. The United States Congressional Budget Office put out a paper earlier this year stating that the corporate statutory rate is one of the many features of the tax system which influence corporate behaviour and we need to look at the average tax rates. We do have a headline tax rate in Australia of 30 per cent, but the average tax rate for Australia in 2012, which these figures were based on, was 17 per cent, and there was an effective tax rate of 10.4 per cent. Of course, in Australia we have dividend imputation—a great Labor reform—which means that every domestic payer of corporate tax in effect gets it back. We actually refund our corporate tax to our domestic investors, something which is quite unique around the world and often gets lost in this debate. If we are going to compare apples with apples, let's have a proper debate. Let's see our corporate tax rates being compared on a proper basis with our competitors around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing which goes to competitiveness is, of course, consistency of policy and we see very little of it from this government. We see the Treasurer falling over himself trying to make political points and trying to accuse this side of the House of being high taxing when in fact it is them who are increasing taxes on every working Australian earning more than $21,000. They are being opposed by us. The Treasurer is quite obsessed with this. If you do a search of his speeches and his transcripts, Bill Shorten and Labor get mentioned a whole lot more than Liberal, the government or any other government policy. The Treasurer is obsessed with those who sit opposite him—a Treasurer completely devoid of any of his own strategy or policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw this particularly a few weeks ago with the Treasurer. He thought he was very clever. He added up all the policies that the Labor Party had announced and threw in a few others the Labor Party hadn't announced and said that it amounted to $160 billion worth of tax rises. He told people that the Parliamentary Budget Office had done this work. I thought that was unusual. I would have thought if the Parliamentary Budget Office had done work like this I would be aware of it. I thought that this was a highly unusual course of events. But my mind was put to rest shortly afterwards when the Parliamentary Budget Officer Jenny Wilkinson said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">References in the media this morning to modelling being released today by the Parliamentary Budget Office are incorrect.…The analysis reported in the media this morning was not conducted by the PBO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer had said this was PBO modelling. Government ministers were out there saying it was PBO modelling, and they were caught out. It was not PBO modelling. It just goes to show how desperate this government is to say and do anything when it comes to the economic debate. Labor will continue to lead that economic debate. We will continue to make our announcements which the government can either follow or not follow, and we've seen this consistently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the government lectures us about tax. Labor took the difficult decision of dealing with tobacco tax in the last term. The government said that this was a tax grab and didn't approve of it at all. Then of course, they adopted it in the budget. We announced our superannuation tax measures. The now Treasurer, who was Minister for Social Services at the time, personally led the campaign against our reform. He said, 'Labor is going to touch your superannuation. Hands off super. This government won't touch your super.' Then of course he became Treasurer and adopted large measures of Labor's policy despite all the rhetoric that he had previously adopted. He didn't do it very competently. He got some of the details wrong, but nevertheless, he did at least realise that something had to give.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then came the negative gearing and capital gains tax. Again, Labor led this debate and announced a detailed policy. The government thought about a scare campaign which went flat at its first outing, and has not taken off at all. We know, perhaps why that's the case, because later on, we read that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer actually support negative gearing reform but got rolled in the cabinet, so their hearts are not in the scare campaign. Maybe that's why it hasn't worked. And then of course Labor has announced our very important plans to deal with tax minimisation through a minimum 30 per cent tax on discretionary trusts. Again, Labor was leading the debate, doing things which had been in the too-hard basket for 30 years.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BOWEN:</span>
                    </a>  The minister at the table says small family businesses. Peter Costello tried this and failed. Joe Hockey tried this and failed. Out of all the last Liberal treasurers, the only one who doesn't believe in dealing with family trusts is the incumbent. John Howard dealt with it when he was Treasurer. He had the courage to stand up to vested interests. John Howard had the courage to deal with family trusts. He applied a minimum tax rate to distributions for minors, but he did not apply it to adults. That was the unfinished business that John Howard left when he was Treasurer. I give him credit for at least attempting against the vested interests which were rampant in the Liberal Party at the time. He showed considerable courage in doing that. Then Peter Costello tried to deal with family trusts. In fact, Peter Costello wrote a letter to the Labor Party promising to deal with family trusts as part of the arrangements at that time. He was forced to renege on that agreement by his party room. Then we had Joe Hockey, when he held my role as shadow Treasurer, giving a speech saying that discretionary trusts needed to be dealt with. The policy was junked the next day. All of these Liberal treasurers have recognised that family trusts needed to be dealt with, but they have not had the courage or conviction to follow it through. Again, this is Labor continuing to lead the economic and policy debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned, before, the matter of competence, which is something that leaves the Labor Party plenty to talk about when it comes to the incompetence of this government. In relation specifically to corporate tax and the legislation before the House, we have seen very considerable confusion over recent weeks about the government's approach: which businesses are eligible; the contrasts between active trading businesses; companies holding passive investments. You would have thought that, on the centrepiece of economic policy which was announced in last year's budget, the government could've got the detail right. But here we have, in this case, the minister for revenue playing desperate catch-up, saying: 'Oh, no, you've misunderstood the law. That's not what we mean.' Well, there are plenty of experts out there who will point out that the legislation, in their reading of it, has a different impact from the one that the minister for revenue and the government would assert it has. So it goes to the heart of the competence of the government—let alone their wrong priorities—that they have not been able to get that policy detail right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes down to it, this is a government with the wrong priorities—a government determined to reduce the tax on businesses, and big businesses in particular, while, at the same time, increasing the tax on working Australians. I've made the point elsewhere that, in technical terms, in detail terms, this is an unfunded corporate tax cut, because it is. There is no funding plan to pay for this. This is what Paul Keating, for example, has pointed out—that this is an unfunded corporate tax cut, quite different from what he did when he was Treasurer, which was to broaden the base, go after loopholes and deal with the inequities in the tax system. He was paying for his policies. This Treasurer has a thought bubble and says: 'Well, we're in political difficulty. We know what we'll do. We will give away $65 billion, completely unfunded.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in another sense it is funded, because it's funded by tax increases on working Australians. We know that the tax burden on PAYG taxpayers will increase in coming years, and it will increase partly because this government is increasing the tax rate through the increase in the Medicare levy. This is very different from what the Treasurer told us would be his approach when he took his current office. He said he was passionate about personal income tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw the member for Reid on <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> with the member for Chifley a few weeks ago. They are very fine entertainers, the pair of them. The member for Chifley towelled up the member for Reid, in fairness. But I saw the member for Reid say, 'We support lower personal tax'. The trouble is: he's going to vote for higher personal tax when he votes for the increase in the Medicare levy, and he's going to do that to fund the corporate tax cut. There was a small hole in the member for Reid's argument—just a little, small hole: that the lower personal tax that he believes in will not be delivered by increasing tax rates. There is a little tip for the member for Reid. The member for Reid has maybe forgotten that policy, but I don't hold it against him. He can't be blamed for it because he looks to his leadership—he looks to the Treasurer—and he gets very mixed signals from the leadership in the government, because the Treasurer told us he was passionate about personal income tax cuts. He told us that it was something that was a priority for him and that he was going to introduce big, swingeing personal tax cuts. He told us that it was a key goal and that bracket creep was an inflation tax and that he was passionate about dealing with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He did deliver a modest degree of personal income tax cuts in his first budget. He announced that, from 1 July 2016, the tax threshold would rise from $80,000 to $87,000, as some tax relief to middle Australia, and the Labor Party supported that. But he has taken it all back—and more—a year later with the Medicare levy increase, which actually raises more than the tax cut that he delivered the year before, but actually applies to different people, because the tax cut that he delivered only applies to people earning more than $80,000, but the tax rise that he wants to deliver applies to all those earning more than $21,000, and that is clearly linked to the legislation which is before us today, which is the $65 billion corporate tax cut, because they have to fund it somehow. The way they're funding it is: an increase in the pressure on PAYG earners, despite what the Treasurer and the government told us would be their approach. Their approach is the complete opposite of what they said that they would do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We actually want to ensure that the PAYG taxpayer gets a fair go, which is why we've worked so hard to announce policies which are dealing with those tax concessions which aren't available or aren't used primarily by your average PAYG taxpayer. The average PAYG taxpayer—maybe a nurse or a teacher or any number of occupations—can't, for example, start a family trust and distribute the income they've made through the PAYG system to members of their family on a lower tax rate. They can't say to their university-aged child, 'Look, you're under the tax-free threshold; we're going to give you $18,000 so that you don't have to pay any tax on that.' They can't say to their parents, 'You don't pay tax, so therefore we'll distribute some income to you to minimise your tax.' They can't do that. Only people who have access to family trusts can do that. How is it fair that some people can do that and other people can't? The fact of the matter is that we've looked at that and said, 'Well, this is about making the tax system fairer,' but we actually carry through with what we say about the tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer makes outlandish claims and sweeping promises that he's going to massively reduce personal income tax and deliver tax cuts and do this and do that, and then he does the exact opposite. What the Labor Party has done is lay out the challenges and problems that we see in the tax system and then deliver detailed policy prescriptions which follow through on that.</span>

He has been sitting at the feet of the Treasurer learning from him, hasn't he? He's been doing it too, because he told us there would be a comprehensive, sweeping housing affordability plan in the budget. That's what he told us. The minister said: 'You are going to be blown away! It's going to be so big, it's going to be the biggest housing plan since Chifley.' We were told it was going to be just ginormous. Expectation management isn't your strong point, Sport! You've got to do better at expectations management, because what we saw was a damp squib from the minister at the table—a complete grab-bag of little measures, some of which are counterproductive and others which don't amount to two-fifths of zero when it comes to housing affordability.</span>

                    </a>  The minister now asks me to name one area where the Labor Party stands for low taxes. We stand for lower taxes on low-income earners, and you stand for higher taxes. You want to increase taxes on every working Australian. That's what this government wants to do. Minister, go out to the Australian people, go out to your electors and explain why you want to increase the taxes on people who earn more than $21,000. That's what you want to do. You stand for higher taxes. The government stands for higher taxes on working Australians. This minister at the table is proud of it. He supports higher taxes on working Australians because he supports an increase in their personal tax rate which this side of the House will oppose and stand against in this chamber and in the other chamber.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will say that those Australians who are dealing with low wages growth and negative real wages growth, who are dealing with the loss of their penalty rates and who are dealing with electricity prices going through the roof on this government's watch as a direct result of the policy uncertainty that this government is delivering, that what this government is doing is increasing their tax rates. This side of the House will stand against that. This side of the House will stand against their proposals to reduce corporate tax because they are a hit on the budget. They are a hit on the budget which will make budget repair impossible.</span>

This government has chosen corporate tax over budget repair. I say to the government: go out and say so. Fess up! Why don't you just be honest with the Australian people and say you've given up on budget repair? You no longer think it's necessary. You no longer think it's important to return to budget balance. The government thinks: 'Actually, we thought it was important, but now it's no longer important. We actually now think a corporate tax cut is more important.' Fair enough. If that's your argument, make it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government won't admit that they can't deliver a balanced budget and they can't deliver budget repair because they are prioritising the corporate tax cut. You simply can't have the situation where you believe in budget repair and you believe in returning the budget to balance, but at the same time you can just give away $65 billion in a corporate tax cut, which is unaffordable and unfunded. And so it is appropriate that the House expresses its view to the government by carrying a second reading amendment. I move:</span>

The House will be interested to know—the member for Werriwa I notice is taking a keen interest—there are a couple of milestones for the Prime Minister later in the week. First, he will overtake Tony Abbott's record as Prime Minister. He will have been Prime Minister for longer than Tony Abbott.   He's managed to hold on longer, by his fingernails, in the party room.</span>

                    </a>  That's right: I am making a supposition that he lasts until Thursday, but I think I'm on reasonable grounds. Next week I couldn't be so sure, but I think this week he's going to make it. And then, later in the week, he will have been Prime Minister for two years. Remember he promised two things. The first was to turn around Newspoll. I make no comment on Newspoll; that's for others to judge. He pointed out that there were 30 negative Newspolls and he said he would turn that around, but that's for others to judge. He also promised new economic leadership. Now, the new economic leadership that he is proposing for the Australian people is a tax rise for those who earn more than $21,000, taking away the penalty rates for Australians who commit no crime other than working on a weekend, and increased electricity prices as a result of the policy uncertainty and instability at the heart of this government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that commissioned a report by the Chief Scientist. The Chief Scientist has told it that the best way you can put downward pressure on electricity prices is a clean energy target. We on this side of House have said, 'Well, okay, that's not our preferred policy option, but we'll go with it if that puts downward pressure on prices and delivers that policy certainty and stability.' But there is a government here that cannot deliver its own policy. It commissioned a report and now its members are at war with each other about whether it should be adopted or not. Well, this side of the House is here to help. It's extended a hand of bipartisanship, but there's no hand on the other side!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This 'new economic leadership' goes to all the wrong priorities incompetently delivered, and that is not new economic leadership; that is a shame for the Australian people. We have had to put up with these two years of false starts, wrong priorities and a government that told us that they wanted to give income tax powers to the states, for example, and reduce all federal funding from education. That was 'new economic leadership'. They are a government that told us that they'd have an increase in the GST and then they wouldn't have an increase in the GST. They are a government that told us they would have big personal income tax cuts and are increasing tax through the Medicare levy. They are a government that told us they would have a corporate tax cut, which is entirely unfunded and is a massive hit to the budget bottom line over the next decade. They are a government which told us they understood the cost-of-living pressures on the Australian people but are reducing penalty rates for those who work on weekends. And they are a government that, of course, have seen the debt blow out on their watch. They are a government that told us there was a debt and deficit disaster, but they have added more debt onto the national accounts or onto the government's figures than was added under the previous Labor government. In their time in office, in their fifth year in office, they've added more debt than was added under the previous Labor administration.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the lack of leadership we see from the government. We see an approach that is fundamentally out of keeping with the priorities that the Australian people so desperately want to see from their government. However, the opposition has taken the opportunity to lead the economic debate and will continue to do so. And, when we contest the next election, we'll seek a mandate to do those big and important things, which this government has so blatantly failed to do.</span>

The significance of what he had to say then and what he's just espoused in this chamber shows you that some politicians are prepared to turn their back on what they believe for their own advancement over that of the general public. This is something we see far too much in modern politics. But it didn't stop there. Again, these are the Shadow Treasurer's words:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the United Kingdom, facing a much tougher fiscal situation than Australia's, cut its company tax rate to 23 per cent in April 2013, to be reduced further to 21 per cent in April 2014.</span>

The two go hand in hand. They do not have one policy that will create one job. They are about politics, not policy. You go through what the shadow Treasurer has to say on negative gearing, a historic reform if you believe the Shadow Treasurer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do you say to the people in Perth? I was there last week. In suburbs in outer Perth, prices have decreased between 15 and 25 per cent in the last 12 months, not only on investment properties but on all properties. The shadow Treasurer, the alternative Treasurer of this country, will be, if elected, the Treasurer for every postcode in this country—not just those in Western Sydney and western Melbourne, where there are marginal seats that he wants to win, but in places like suburban Perth, where, if it weren't for the fact that banks in Australia have an Australia-wide loan book, you would have right now a subprime crisis. You have people who have bought into that market in the last five years who have negative equity in their homes. You have record numbers in mortgage stress around the country. Darwin is suffering from the lack of fly-in fly-out workers, with house prices down seven per cent year on year—and the shadow Treasurer thinks negative-gearing changes there would be a good move! You will rip the guts out of the housing market in places that can't afford it. In Perth, you will deadset have tumbleweeds rolling down the street. You have 25 per cent decreases in people's homes. A lot of people find themselves in a situation of negative equity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With negative-gearing changes in those places, rural Australia included—in Western Sydney and western Perth, we have an issue, yes. However, you have seen on the front page of today's <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> that changes by APRA to the ways banks lend to investment, coupled with clampdowns on foreign investment in this market, have seen declines. Harry Triguboff came out and stated that in New South Wales and south-east Queensland—the Reserve Bank governor adding south-east Queensland last week—you have the lag of supply following demand. But the sad part is that the measures that have been taken in the last 12 to 18 months have now curtailed demand. You will now see that glut hit the market, and that will be an issue for the broader market in its entirety.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the war on business is not limited to opposing these tax cuts; it is a war on investment across the board, be it capital gains tax—the shadow Treasurer spoke about family trusts. What he completely neglected to point out—and no-one has yet pointed it out in this debate—is that the global financial crisis saw a change in the way businesses in this country employ people. They needed flexibility. You saw two things happen. You saw a casualisation of the workforce and you also saw companies disband their workforce and hire them back as contractors. Guess what the contractors did? They had to set up as businesses themselves to contract back to the companies. So what did they do? They went to see their financial advisers.</span>

They would then set up their business with, usually, a proprietary limited company sitting out at the front of a family trust. Why? Because you have limited liability in the company and you distribute through the trust. The trust does not actually pay tax; it distribute to the beneficiaries, who pay top-up tax at their appropriate marginal rate. The growth that has occurred in trusts in the last five to seven years has been driven by how the workforce has evolved post GFC. Businesses are still shy. The economy is still soft. Underemployment sits at levels that are of great concern. Attacking business is not the answer; fostering business is the answer. Why? Because when businesses make greater profits—it has happened since Adam was a boy, and not just in Australia but worldwide—they reinvest in their business. What happens when they do that? They grow. What happens when businesses grow? They employ more people. We see it with small and medium-sized businesses all the time. They are interested in reinvesting in their business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If they lost their job, they would most likely lose their home. They put their family home on the line every day. What do they do at the back of it? They employ workers. I can tell you this, coming from a family business background, and I have been lucky enough to have met with some success along the way. My family owns a number of assets. However, the most important asset that my family has at its disposal is our amazing workforce, our staff. Why? Because we can't open the doors without them, as all small and family businesses can't. I grew up going to staff weddings, staff christening and staff funerals. Why? Because the staff were part of the family. That's how it happens in small and medium-sized family businesses. That's the reality of what we're talking about here. That's what those opposite, sadly, don't understand, because they've never actually done it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're talking about is fostering entrepreneurial flair, backing people who take risks, backing people who put their homes on the line to start small and medium-sized businesses that grow to be big businesses. The principle doesn't change, irrespective of the size of the business. If you reduce company taxation—and we have a policy that we're talking about today to do that—you will incentivise business to invest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow Treasurer said in 2013, in today's highly competitive, mobile-capital world, you need to be competitive internationally. The shadow Treasurer, in his additions or amendments to the bill, spoke about tax cuts also for millionaires. Since when did $180,001 become a millionaire? They selectively choose the number they want, because it makes a nice political slogan. They want the top marginal tax rate in this country to be at 49½c in the dollar. That's not internationally competitive. You will lose people to places like Singapore and all through south-eastern Asia, where the tax rates are far lower and human capital is mobile.</span>

However, last Saturday I worked on council elections—another day of my life I might not get back—and I stopped at a McDonald's on the way there to grab a coffee. As the barista was making the coffee, there was a young boy there sweeping the floor. The barista said to him, 'Are you new?' He said, 'Yes, I started last week.' I looked at him and I said to him, 'What's your name, mate?' He said, 'Shaun.' I said: 'Mate, what shifts do you work? What are you doing? You're at school, obviously.' He said, 'Yes, I am.' He said, 'I work six hours on a Wednesday after school; I work six hours on a Saturday and six hours on a Sunday.' Under the EBA that the SDA union has done with McDonald's—which is starting to come out in the Senate inquiry that is going on into this—Shaun will be short paid. He'll be paid $27 less this week than he would if he was on the award. That's 1,350 bucks a year that the union movement has ripped off a 15-year-old schoolkid. That's the hypocrisy of what we're talking about opposite. The SDA union, which has given $10 million—</span>

Your job. That's what might ultimately be at risk. That should never be the case. You should never attack business, because businesses employ people. The shadow Treasurer understood it in 2013. Sadly, he has put his hands up and capitulated—as have others on the shadow front bench. It's sad, because it goes against everything economic he has written.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  Today, I want to deal with three arguments that the coalition have made for cutting the company tax rate. They've claimed that Labor once supported cuts to the company tax, they've claimed that other countries have lower corporate tax rates and that ours are comparatively high and they've claimed that cutting the company tax rate for big business will boost growth. I will explain to the House, in turn, the problems with each of these arguments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the coalition claim that Labor in the past supported lower company tax rates. It is certainly true that Paul Keating took the approach of broadening the base so you could lower the rate. Against the opposition of the Liberal and National parties of the day, Paul Keating brought in reforms like capital gains tax, fringe benefits taxation and an assets test on the pension. He made hard decisions to ensure that our tax base was broader and our social safety net better targeted, and in so doing was able to finance a rate cut. This broadening of the corporate tax base was the same philosophy that underpinned the Gillard government's approach. We said at the time we'd support a modest reduction in corporate tax in return for broadening the base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has changed since then? Unfortunately, a lot has changed. In 2013, net government debt in Australia was $184 billion. Now net government debt is $325 billion, in 2016-17, as reported in the last budget. In the 2013 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the estimate for 2016-17 debt was $217 billion. That is a full $108 billion lower than the actual figure came in at. Net debt will have increased by $141 billion since the coalition came to office, which equates to $5,700 for every man, woman and child in Australia. When we debated for the first time the coalition's tax plan, everyone listening to the debate was told that the Liberals had increased government debt per person by $4,500. But now, if you need an answer to the question: 'Why is now a bad time to cut the corporate tax rate?' the simple answer is: $5,700 of Liberal-National debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the notorious 2014 budget, the projected deficit for 2017-18 was about $3 billion. It has now increased to $29 billion, nearly 10 times worse than forecast just a few years ago. A party that used to hold press conferences in front of debt trucks, ought by rights to be driving debt road trains for what they've done to debt. They used to talk about debt and deficit disasters and used firefighting metaphors, but you don't hear much now from the coalition about debt, and that's for one simple reason: their $65 billion corporate tax cut. Frankly, they have taken the Reaganite approach. As Ronald Reagan in the 1980s ramped up debt, cut taxes and left the problem to someone else, so too the coalition are now hoping to kick the debt can down the road, increasing debt but failing to make the hard decisions, as Labor has done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, Labor has made tough decisions around negative gearing, around trusts and around deductions for managing tax affairs. We recognise that it is only through proper base-broadening that you earn the right to have conversations about expenditure or about lower rates. The coalition have not earned that right, because the coalition have been unable and unwilling to make tough decisions on fiscal policy in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the comparative position of Australia's corporate tax rate. Australia has a rate, as honourable members know, of 27.5 per cent for small and medium businesses up to $10 million and 30 per cent for other businesses. The government's proposal is to bring the overall tax rate down to 25 per cent for all companies. A phase down to 25 per cent is already legislated over the next decade for companies up to $50 million in turnover. Their argument, the argument they so often make, is that we have to do this because Australia's corporate tax rate ranks us unusually high. Well, let's have a look at a careful analysis of that. The US Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan budget outfit, published its international comparisons of corporate income tax rates in March 2017. It contains summary table 1 on page 2, which ranks G20 corporate tax rates from highest to lowest on three metrics: the statutory corporate tax rate, the average corporate tax rate and the effective corporate tax rate. On the statutory corporate tax rate, Australia's 30 per cent rate ranks as 10th. On the average corporate tax rate, Australia's rate ranks us 15th, the fourth-lowest in the G20. On the effective corporate tax rate, we're ranked 11th. So we are average or below average for our corporate tax rate compared with the G20, which is surely the relevant comparison. The G20 are the world's 20 largest economies. If we want to do an apples-to-apples comparison, let's not sit there cherry-picking comparisons with countries that have no social safety net to speak of. Let's not do comparisons with countries whose residents are pushing hard to move to Australia and to which very few Australians would like to move. Let's do comparisons with the world's 20 biggest economies. When you do that, you get the answer that our corporate tax rate is at or below average compared to the G20. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another little secret that those advocating a corporate tax cut don't often let you in on and that's dividend imputation. It is a system that gives back a share of the corporate tax revenue to individual taxpayers. A rough rule of thumb, according to Geoffrey Kingston's 2015 analysis, and <span style="font-style:italic;">JASSA: The F</span><span style="font-style:italic;">insia Journal of Applied Finance, </span>is that dividend imputation gives back a third of corporate tax revenue. So in terms of what the government raises through corporate taxation, a 30 per cent rate with imputation raises about as much as a 20 per cent rate without imputation. If you hear anyone doing international corporate tax comparisons and they don't mention imputation, you know they're being deeply disingenuous. You hear people say that Britain has a 20 per cent rate or Donald Trump would like a 20 per cent rate for the United States, but just remember that Australia's 30 per cent rate with dividend imputation already today raises about as much as a 20 per cent rate without imputation. If you ignore that, you are either deliberately obfuscating the debate or ignorant of one of the central facts in this debate. The very fact is that powerhouse economies around the world have corporate tax rates comparable to Australia's ignoring imputation. Take into account imputation and Australia's corporate rate is, if anything, significantly lower than the relevant comparator companies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we turn to the government's argument that a corporate tax cut will boost growth. One way of knocking down that argument is to simply go to the government's own analysis, a paper released on budget night last year entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Analysis of the long term effects of a company tax cut</span>. You need to work carefully through this paper to see what the government's argument is. Firstly, domestic shareholders barely benefit from corporate tax cuts. As the Grattan Institute's John Daley pointed out, local shareholders only gain if profits are reinvested rather than paid out. Given the surprisingly high pay out ratios among Australia's listed companies, most of the $8 billion annual gain from a corporate tax cut will go overseas in the first instance. Indeed, there'll be cases in which US based multinationals repatriate their profits, paying the difference between their higher rate and our lower one, which will mean that an Australian corporate tax cut will just go into the coffers of the US Treasury and be spent by the successors to President Trump—because, of course, we're talking about impacts a fair way down the line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go on with the argument in the government's own analysis. The Treasury report argues that, having enjoyed the first-round benefits of a company tax cut, foreign shareholders will respond to higher after-tax profits on their Australian investments. The theory goes that overseas shareholders then invest less in other countries and more in Australia, which means greater demand for land and labour, so in the long run land prices and wages are supposed to rise. But this long run is pretty long. Given that we're typically talking about seven to 10 years after the change comes to fruition, and since the coalition's tax cut only reduces the tax rate on big business to 25 per cent on 1 July 2026, this means we're talking about benefits somewhere between 2033 and 2035. At that stage, Prime Minister Turnbull would be in his late 70s and the longest-serving Prime Minister since Menzies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But how big will those gains be? The Treasury report says that corporate tax cuts could be funded by a nationwide land tax, which is pretty unlikely given that the federal government hasn't had one of those since 1952, or lower government spending, which is pretty unlikely given that the government has failed to implement its promises on government spending. The most likely scenario is that a company tax cut for big business would be funded by higher personal income taxes. In other words, we'd cut the taxes on big business and increase the taxes on individual taxpayers—just as, for example, we're seeing with the coalition's attempt at the moment to raise the Medicare levy on anyone earning over $21,000. It's well along a path which would see it fund a corporate rate cut through an individual rate rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that assumption, the government's modelling suggests the benefit to households is 0.1 per cent. How big is 0.1 per cent? It's roughly the rate of household income growth per month since the early 1970s. So the government is promising an extra month's worth of household income growth, in the 2030s, in exchange for higher personal income taxes. Put that way, it doesn't sound like that much of a deal. Particularly with wage growth at a 30-year low, inequality at a 75-year high and homeownership at a 60-year low, 0.1 per cent to households in the mid-2030s isn't much to write home about. As Ross Gittins says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If you wanted to create jobs, cutting the tax on foreign investors isn't the way to do it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bernard Keane says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It could be the greatest tax avoidance scam ever perpetrated …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent study written up in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span> by Sarah Anderson of the Institute for Policy Studies takes another approach. She and her co-authors consider the argument that a lower corporate rate creates jobs by looking at the 92 publicly held American corporations that reported a profit every year in the US from 2008 to 2015 but paid less than 20 per cent of their earnings in federal income tax. They looked at the job creation rate in those companies. Do US companies that pay a low corporate rate create more jobs? After all, we get told every day that a lower corporate rate will be a job creator. But they found exactly the opposite. They found that those companies had a median job growth rate over the past nine years of negative one per cent, compared to six per cent for the private sector as a whole. Of those 92 companies, they found that 48 got rid of a combined total of 483,000 jobs. Of course, the news wasn't all bad in those firms. If you were a chief executive in those firms, your pay averaged nearly $15 million, compared to the $13 million average for S&amp;P 500 companies. So, right now in the US, companies that pay less corporate income tax create fewer jobs but pay more to their CEOs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If that's the kind of race to the bottom that the coalition have in mind, it's short shrift for Australian workers. Australian workers won't see more jobs as a result of this big business tax cut. Instead, they'll see more debt and higher taxes. If you want to see business grow, you need to invest in trained workers, move away from National Party pork-barrelling in infrastructure and put in place clean energy policies that are market driven rather than continually attacking renewables. You need an instant asset write-off that doesn't have a sudden-death expiration but continues providing stability for businesses looking to invest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the extraordinary spectacle of the coalition wasting millions of dollars trying to buy credibility for its multinational tax reforms. At the very time when we have a $340 million judgement against Chevron, the coalition are patting themselves on the back. Yet, in 2012, they voted against the very same laws that secured that judgement. If they had any honesty, they'd be apologising to the Australian people for voting against Labor's laws to close multinational tax loopholes, not patting themselves on the back. The coalition needs to commit to tightening debt-deduction loopholes used by multinational companies, which would improve the budget by nearly $5 billion over the decade. We need greater transparency. We need better treatment of multiple-entry consolidated groups. We need to close tax loopholes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  It's always good to follow the member for Fenner, dressed resplendently in his woollen suit—made from wool probably from a sheep raised on a farm in an electorate which was held by a National Party member. I know he's a very good marathon runner, and to run marathons you need to be able to have the food inside you that keeps you running to the finish line—food grown, probably, in one of those National Party electorates that he condemns. There is nothing wrong with National Party electorates getting well-funded so that we can provide the food and fibre that you, Member for Fenner, and everybody else needs. When the regions are strong then so, too, are the capital city electorates just like yours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fenner mentioned the imputation system and said that members would be disingenuous if they didn't mention it. If you go to the Australian Taxation Office website, it talks about imputations; it talks about franking; and, importantly, it talks about the prevention of double taxation. It says that that is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the taxation of profits when earned by a corporate tax entity, and again when a recipient receives a distribution.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So true. Indeed, double taxation is when a Labor government, like we had when I first entered parliament, goes and proposes a policy and implements it—like the minerals resource rent tax, which was never going to raise any money—and then spends it before the money even comes in, and then, when the money doesn't come in, because it was never going to, they've already spent the money, and they've just added to the debt and deficit. Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly, you know as well as I do, and as every member on this side of the parliament knows: that's what Liberals and Nationals do—we clean up the mess left by those opposite.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> article entitled 'Goodbye to the mining tax, and good riddance', written by Elizabeth Knight on 3 September 2014, where it states that:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what Labor does. They've paid for things long before they've accrued the money to pay for them. It is a form of double taxation because then they have to tax the daylights out of small business and out of good hardworking Australians to make up for their mess.</span>

He was right then, and I don't know why he didn't—during the half hour of time which we on this side of the House endured in listening to him just a short while ago—talk about it being a Labor thing now. If it was well and good in 2013, why isn't it good now?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal and National's plan for a brighter future, for supporting jobs growth, for attracting investment and for creating opportunities for more Australians: that's what the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill is and will be into the future. It's a 10-year plan for a secure future for our children and generations to come. What could be more important?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've gone about the nation on my small-business roadshow—I've visited a number of Labor electorates, too, I might add—I've met hundreds of small-business owners who've backed themselves and risked it all to make a go in business. It's fantastic to see them doing just that. Business creates jobs, not government. It's entrepreneurial spirit. People willing to take that risk are the ones who are creating jobs, not us. We might talk a big game—we might take the credit for it—but it's business people who risk everything, including their houses, to have a go who are creating the opportunities for more Australians to be employed. As we heard from the Treasurer during question time today, there have been more people employed in the past six months than at any other time in recent decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be under no false illusions: the road on the path back to wealth and prosperity is not an easy one to navigate. Having run my own small business, as have many of my colleagues, I understand the personal investment and commitment involved to get a business up and running and off the ground. We know that by lightening the load on business, economic activity will increase, including increased investment, employment and wages growth. The Liberal and Nationals government wants to give business the confidence to grow and to invest and to create more jobs for all Australians to benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds on the vast array of small-business measures the government has delivered. Never has there been a more small-business-friendly government than this one. We've already cut taxes for small businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million, reducing the tax rate to 27.5 per cent, its lowest level in 77 years. There are more than 3.2 million small businesses in Australia, having a go and employing 5.6 million people, who are set to benefit from this bill and other measures that we're putting into place. The response for small businesses has been resounding: 99 per cent of businesses have access to small-business incentives, including the popular $20,000 instant asset write-off, which was extended by 12 months in this year's budget. This popular program supports small businesses to invest in the assets they need while boosting business productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're cutting taxes and we're also cutting red tape. As part of the budget, $300 million was put on the table to incentivise states, whatever their political persuasion, to get on board and to cut some of that bureaucracy, to cut some of that red tape, to cut some of that overlap between federal and state jurisdictions. Time is money in business, and so we're working with the states and the territories to simplify red tape and streamline services. We've recently passed legislation for fairer competition laws, levelling the playing field for small business and driving competition in the market while also providing better, greater, stronger protections. The Liberals and Nationals want to see businesses grow, and our plan is working to reduce barriers, to stimulate investment and to encourage more investment. We want to see jobs growth and increased wages through tax relief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member for Fenner doesn't understand that. I know he doesn't get that, but if you put in place tax cuts, businesses profit. They then have the incentive to employ more Australians. That leads to higher wages, which leads to economic growth. Treasury modelling suggests that when the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan is implemented our policy to cut taxes to 25 per cent across the board will permanently generate an increase to the economy of more than one per cent of gross domestic product—more than $17 billion in today's dollars each year. They are big numbers. They are important numbers. For a business to pursue a new idea or give someone else a go takes courage. It requires risk. That's why our plan to provide tax relief will back business and inspire confidence to invest and to grow. The National Australia Bank small-and-medium enterprise report released on 5 September said that 70 per cent of SMEs think Australia is a great place to do business. The report shows that SMEs want to grow but are finding it difficult to see through a maze of red tape and regulation. That's why the government has taken action. That's why it's part of the May budget. We incentivised the states to do what they could to remove duplication and compliance for small business. To date we have already cut $5.8 billion between 2013 and 2016, eclipsing our target of a billion dollars per year. We are also making it simpler for businesses to report payroll and superannuation information to the ATO through the Single Touch Payroll. I complement the member for Reid, the assistant minister, who has rolled out the National Business Simplification Initiative in the hospitality sector in Parramatta, reducing the time it takes for the first registration papers to go into ASIC. From the time you decide to start a small business, it used to take 18 months. We've got that down to three months in the hospitality sector. Because it's been such a success, it is going to be rolled out in other sectors in other areas and in other places across Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NAB report on SMEs also shows that more than 84 per cent of small and medium enterprises believe the government should provide better tax breaks and incentives to small business. We are doing just that. We are getting on with the job. It also shows that almost 37 per cent of SMEs have wanted to expand but have hesitated, 45 per cent citing uncertainty and economic conditions. Australian business can have confidence that the coalition government is delivering its commitment to lower taxes across the board to increase growth and competitiveness. The economy is diversifying and expanding, and the government understands that businesses of all sizes have an important role to play. The tax cut that we've already delivered is a good start. The passage of this bill seeks to lower the company tax rate to all businesses and that will provide another boost. As I said, we are getting on with the job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over a decade, this bill will lower the tax rate for all businesses to encourage investment and higher paid jobs by progressively decreasing the tax rate for all businesses to 25 per cent by 2026-27. We have to do this to remain internationally competitive, to take advantage of the Asian century and to make sure that we're right up to speed with our competitors and with those with whom we trade. Our plan to lower taxes has received wide support from business and industry. Ai Group Chief Executive Innes Willox in a survey of members released on 5 May said that tax relief is top priority. The survey gave top ranking to reducing the burden of business taxation and showed that, '54 per cent of business leaders give top or second-highest ranking to the reduction of the small business tax burden. This is an unambiguous expression of support for the government's enterprise tax plan.' I couldn't have said it better myself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It’s imperative that the parliament passes the Enterprise Tax Plan in its entirety to restore Australia’s company tax rate to the middle of the pack and protect and grow jobs in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I couldn't have said it better myself. We want to encourage investment and for more Australians to back themselves and follow their business dreams. Our plan supports them to make those dreams, those aspirations and those hopes a reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, what do we see? A Labor Party that is antibusiness and beholden to the union agenda. Labor's reckless attitude to spending will be funded by taxing small business at every opportunity and ripping money out of the pockets of hardworking Australians. Labor counts the cost of the enterprise tax plan in its savings figures—that's what they do. We all remember, just prior to the last couple of elections, Labor putting in savings measures and going to the electorate saying that they were going to put in place savings measures if they were elected. And what did they do? They then opposed them in the Senate. They opposed them in this place when we said, 'Look, let's do it. Let's go with your savings measures.' They don't want to do it. They count the cost of the enterprise tax plan in their own savings figures. Australian small business can only assume that Labor is taking a backward step, as per usual, and redefining small business to that of a turnover of $2 million and not what we've got it at now of $10 million. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, Australian families and businesses will be hit with more than $150 billion worth of taxes. Labor views small business turnover as a river of gold from which they can fund their tax and spending ideology, hurting business and our economy. No-one is safe from Labor's tax grab. There will be tax upon tax upon tax to fund their spending addiction. Under the Labor alternative, tax cuts for small business will be under siege. The instant asset write-off will probably be gone. Family and small-business trusts are also under siege. We heard the member for Fenner condemning trusts. But we expanded it. We extended it in the last budget and, let me tell you, Australian businesses love it.</span>

He wants to pull the rug out from under the housing market—so typical. What Australian small businesses do not need is another policy from Labor that will put pressure on budgets, stifle growth and destroy confidence, because confidence is what courses through the veins of small-business owners. Confidence is a perception, but it's also a reality and, let me tell you, the member for Maribyrnong is pro union and anti business. If he ever becomes the Prime Minister of this country then pity help the small businesses, the medium enterprises and the farmers in your electorate and mine.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I'm speaking in support of the amendment that's been moved by the shadow Treasurer and in opposition to the substantive bill. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, of course, institutes the government's proposals to provide further tax cuts for multinational corporations in Australia. It demonstrates just how this government believes our economy should be managed and who it should be managed for, because what this bill does is provide a massive tax cut for large multinational corporations, including the big four banks in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, this government is making it harder for pensioners, for families, for mums and dads and kids and for small businesses to get by. We see that every day in the explosion in electricity prices that small businesses and families have to deal with. Pensioners can't afford to put their heaters on at night, because they simply can't pay their energy bills anymore due to a lack of investment in the electricity industry in Australia, fuelled by the policy uncertainty generated by this government and the fact that it just can't agree on a clean energy target. By supporting cuts to penalty rates, it's talking about again making it harder for workers to make ends meet. It does everything in its capacity to make it harder for unions to collectively bargain and represent workers in particular industries, but it is willing to give a big tax cut to multinational corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's instructive that the minister that spoke before me in support of this particular piece of legislation was quoting the Business Council of Australia. I mean, are you kidding me? They're really in touch with the average pensioner, the average Australian worker and the Australian battling family in rural and regional Australia, aren't they? The Business Council of Australia! Of course they're going to support tax cuts for their large multinational members, and what these tax cuts mean is more profits for those businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the profit share of income in Australia over the last decade, you see it's been growing for big businesses and it has been shrinking for wage earners. Big businesses have been getting more profits. For Australian workers that work their backsides off day in, day out, week in, week out to earn money for their families, their share of GDP in this country has been shrinking, and this bill will make it worse. This bill will exacerbate the inequality that exists in Australia when it comes to incomes. Is it any wonder that Australian pensioners, workers and their families are just sick to death? They are sick to death of the growing inequality in this country and feeling left behind by change and by government reform of this nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill amends the Income Tax Rates Act and progressively extends the lower 27½ per cent corporate tax rate to all corporate entities by 2023-24. The corporate tax rate would then be cut for all corporate tax entities to 27 per cent from 2024-25, 26 per cent from 2025-26, and 25 per cent from 2026-27. Schedules 2 to 4 make consequential amendments to the income tax laws to reflect the extension of the reduction in the corporate tax rate to all corporate entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has made no secret of its campaign to provide these tax cuts for big multinational corporations while people on low to middle incomes in Australia are struggling to make ends meet. You need look no further than the disastrous $65 billion company tax cut to see just how the Turnbull government likes and treats its mates in big business. According to Treasury modelling, the government's company tax cuts will generate 0.1 per cent—not one per cent—economic growth in Australia and will generate next to no jobs. This is the Treasury's own modelling. It shows that there is no economic benefit at all from these tax cuts. So you would have to ask the question: if you are about jobs and growth in this country, why are you doing this when there is no demonstrable benefit at all for our economy? The reason is those on that side of the chamber want to do all they can to back big business at the expense of hardworking Australian tax-paying families, workers and pensioners. It is about who they line up with and who they support. This policy and this bill clearly demonstrate that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the companies that will benefit from this, in fact, some of the biggest beneficiaries from this will be the big four Australian banks. And haven't they done a wonderful job over the last decade in providing quality services for Australian workers, their families and pensioners, restoring confidence in the Australian banking industry, taking care of Australians and ensuring that they are treating them with the respect that they deserve? We've seen scandal after scandal in the CommInsure scandal and the wealth management scandal that all the banks have been involved in. Most recently, we saw the allegations levelled against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia by AUSTRAC in respect of potential breaches of Australia's anti-money laundering and terrorism financing laws. Yet these are the people that this government wants to give and believes deserve a tax cut in the nature of five per cent over the course of the next decade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this government should be giving the banks isn't a tax cut; they should be giving them a royal commission. We should be getting to the bottom of what's going on in the banking sector and why the average Australian has been ripped off by the banks over the course of the last decade. Many Australian families have suffered much pain and indignity at the hands of the banks. Again, I notice that the shadow minister, in introducing his comments to this bill, didn't quote any small businesses. It was all about what big business associations want with these tax cuts, but not small businesses, because there are plenty of small businesses that have been done over by the banks in this country. They want a royal commission. They want their voice to be heard, their situation to be aired, and justice and compensation delivered. They're not going to get it from this government. What they are going to get from this government is a multibillion-dollar handout for big business in the form of a $56 billion tax cut over the course of the next decade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Never mind the fact that the budget is in a perilous state, that the deficit is increasing year on year and that debt in Australia is increasing year on year. What happened to the so-called budget emergency? That's all forgotten about. With this particular measure, initially they said ripped about $56 billion out of the budget. Under questioning from the shadow Treasurer in question time, they admitted that it was closer to $64 billion. How is that money going to be replaced? Where is that money going to come into the budget to ensure that we're funding a decent education system so that we give kids the opportunity to get a decent trade and go to university? How are we going to be able to fund the additional healthcare services and aged-care places that we are going to need as our population ages? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The view of those opposite is, 'Don't worry. Don't worry. Trickle-down economics will kick in. We provide these tax cuts for big multinational corporations. They earn more money. Guess what? They start investing more and employing more.' The Treasury's own modelling demonstrates that that's not a cogent argument. That's a false argument. There is no economic benefit in these tax cuts at all. They won't deliver additional employment. This notion of trickle-down economics is utter rubbish. It simply does not work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You only need to ask an auto worker or a middle-income service worker in the United States what they think about trickle-down economics, which the Reagan administration and the Bush administration specialised in. They've got nothing out of it. They haven't had real wage increases in the United States for the last 30 years, because of trickle-down economics, and this Turnbull government wants to introduce these policies here, into Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wages growth in Australia is struggling. For private sector agreements approved in the March quarter, wage rises fell to 2.7 per cent, and they fell to 2.4 per cent in the public sector. Wage rises in the private sector haven't been so low since 1991. Across both private and public sectors, wage increases have only been around 2.7 per cent. They've dropped from 3.1 per cent in the December quarter. We've got underemployment and an increase in casualisation, and living standards are stagnating. Apprentice numbers have collapsed. It's harder than ever for a young Australian to enter the housing market, and this government's plan to help people battling to get into the housing market is to provide a big tax cut for some of the big banks that have made it harder for people to get home loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The housing market in the area that I represent is out of control. It's gone through the roof. That's the case in Sydney and Melbourne. This government just wants to ignore the fact that many young Australians simply won't be able to enter the housing market. They simply will not be able to afford to own their own home unless they have rich parents, and that's the view of the Prime Minister: you should just get your mum and dad to give you a leg-up and to help you out with a deposit on a home. Well, ask a single mum living in Western Sydney with a couple of kids who's working on weekends who's about to have her penalty rates cut about whether or not she can afford to give a leg-up to her kids. Ask a family working in south-west Sydney who are struggling to make ends meet about whether or not they can afford to just hand on a deposit to their kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, if the government were serious about tackling some of the inconsistencies and the inequity in the housing market, they would tackle negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts, because the overwhelming majority of those tax concessions go to the wealthiest Australians. In fact, 70 per cent of the benefits of the capital gains tax discount go to the top 10 per cent of income earners in this country. That fact alone says everything about what is wrong with the Australian housing market at the moment, why it's an investors' market and why young families can't afford to buy their own home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the government want to give a tax cut to the big banks that are fuelling and financing that. It comes on the back of their strategy of giving millionaires a $16½ thousand tax cut in the last budget but making someone that's on less than $64,000 a year pay an additional $320-odd in tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen that low-income workers who work in the hospitality sector and who work on weekends stand to lose up to $77 a week through the cuts to penalty rates, supported and cheered on by this government. In the electorate of Kingsford Smith, there are 11½ thousand retail and hospitality workers who stand to lose money and receive a pay cut because of that decision of the Fair Work Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to recently meet with a group of hairdressers, some from my community, who are fighting the fact that their industry is next on the chopping block. Their industry association is now using the precedent that was set by the penalty rates decision in the hospitality and retail industry to flow it on to other industries, including hairdressers. We warned people that this would occur, that it wasn't just confined to those industries. They're seeking now to flow it on to hairdressing, and you can bet your life that it will continue to flow on and that, despite what this government said, yes, nurses and, yes, emergency service workers, those people in vital occupations that rely on shiftwork, will be in the firing line in the future. There's no doubt about that if this Turnbull government gets its way and if its philosophy of taking money from hardworking Australians by cuts to penalty rates and other conditions is met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill represents everything that is wrong with this Turnbull government in terms of its twisted priorities. Not only does it take about $60-odd billion out of the budget at a time when we've got an increasing budget deficit and increasing debt in this country but it also ensures that the biggest businesses, many of whom are unworthy of a tax cut, receive that tax cut. They won't pass it on in the form of new investment—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Question time is a robust debate in this place, and it should be. However, day after day we have to sit through the Deputy Prime Minister and the Melbourne inner city minister for energy claiming that I and the other Hunter Labor MPs are betraying coalminers and energy workers. In this narrative, the government is the working man's best friend and we are hypocrites. I completely reject this narrative. It bears no resemblance to reality. It is offensive to me and, more importantly it is offensive to the workers and communities that I represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is using them as debating props for scoring cheap political points, and this is the most disgraceful aspect of the debate. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the motley crew of charlatans, hypocrites and venal time servers that constitute their frontbench are an embarrassment. Deputy Prime Minister: being mates with Gina Rinehart does not make you a friend of coalminers. Coalminers don't get free trips to India on Gina's private jet. Most coalminers don't get to study at the $40,000-a-year St Ignatius' Riverview College.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the Deputy Prime Minister I pose the following questions. If you really care about coalminers, where were you yesterday when every other federal MP who represents the Hunter region, which you purport to represent, attended the annual Miners Memorial Day at Cessnock? This day commemorates the 1,803 women, men and, tragically, children as young as 11 who have died in Hunter coalmines. Where were you, Deputy Prime Minister? I didn't see you offering condolences to the grieving family of the latest worker to suffer a tragic and unnecessary death at a Hunter coalmine. I haven't heard the Deputy Prime Minister calling for better mine regulation and safety enforcement. Instead, I see cheap taunts thrown around in question time while the Deputy Prime Minister and the government perpetrate two acts of national shame. Firstly, they continue to weaken worker protection laws in this country by restricting the ability of unions to enter workplaces and limiting what workers and firms can include in enterprise agreements, making it harder for safety standards to be enforced. The rise of labour hire and increased use of short-term contractors are undermining workplace safety. In the northern coalfields, sadly, we are averaging one workplace death a year. We have also seen the return of black lung, a disease we had hoped we had seen eradicated in our coal communities. What is the government's response? It wants to outlaw the mineworkers' union. What a shameful act!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second act of shame that this government is perpetuating is their continuing lies to energy workers about their future. Everyone knows there'll never been a coal-fired power station built in this country without massive public subsidy. The workers know it, the generators acknowledge it and the financiers demonstrate it through where they invest their funds. Thermal and coking coal exports have a strong future, but we will never build another coal-fired power station in this country without massive public subsidies. We owe it to the energy workers, their families and the communities that depend upon that industry to have an honest conversation about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most disrespectful thing a politician can do is to lie to workers, and that is exactly what this government is doing. My community understands the realities. What they want is a government that will work with them; a government that will put forward a well-resourced plan to look after the workers and communities affected and to diversify the economic base of these regions. I committed in my first speech to fight for my community and to be honest with them. I will spend every day that I have the privilege to represent the people of Shortland doing just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My neighbour is a coalminer and my kids go to kindy with the children of energy workers and coalminers. I am proud of our mining heritage, and recognise the wealth generated by the 18,000 coalminers who risk their lives to mine this resource. The best way I can commit to commemorating the 1,803 miners who have lost their lives in Hunter coalmines is to fight for laws that mean no other family has to receive the dreaded call that they have lost a loved one. In comparison, we have a Deputy Prime Minister, a Prime Minister and a government that continue to lie, that continue to use workers a political props and continue to treat my region—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="61378" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  Earlier this year I reported to the House on some arts funding announcements for Queensland, and I noted the additional assistance this government is making to Opera Queensland: $2.3 million over three years following the recommendations of the National Opera Review. I also noted the additional funding for Queensland Ballet to maintain the Commonwealth's funding share at 20 per cent. Of course, Queensland's arts industry is not just defined by the four major performing arts companies, as important and as impressive as they are. In my first year as a member, I've been delighted to visit the big and the small, the collaborative and the independent, from traditional arts and Indigenous arts through to emerging fields like circus and cutting-edge digital offerings. I should say in passing how enjoyable it's been to interact with our arts sector in Brisbane and around Queensland. The variety and the opportunities for Brisbane's arts scene were firmly in my mind when I campaigned heavily against Labor's lockout laws, which would have the terrible impact of shutting down many of the live music and other creative spaces in our city and places like the valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, I raised some concerns about Queensland's share of national arts funding. Those concerns have been building in many of the discussions that I've had with local artists, companies, venues and other arts sector participants not just in Brisbane but right around Queensland. I want to inform the parliament tonight that other LNP members and senators in Queensland have similar concerns. Indeed, this issue is of such significance to my LNP colleagues around Queensland that we are acting together, united, to pursue this issue. Team Queensland—that is, all 26 LNP members and senators in Queensland—are pursuing this issue of arts funding with the same focus and unity that we've been dedicating to our defence industry and the Land 400 project we've been fighting to have based in the great state of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleagues in the Queensland LNP and I have been troubled as we've uncovered more evidence that Queensland has traditionally been receiving less arts funding per capita than any other state or territory in the Commonwealth. When it comes to per capita funding for the arts, Queensland appears to be very last in the queue. That inequity is not a recent phenomenon; it appears to be an entrenched trend, the result of years of institutional inertia that we suspect becomes self-reinforcing if it has the effect of sending Queensland's artistic talent and management capabilities to other states. Queensland receiving a lower per capita share of national arts funding is doubly curious when you consider how, out of all of the states, Queensland has the largest proportion of people living outside its capital city. You'd therefore expect the costs of delivering arts to the whole community to be, on average, higher for our more regional population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are the numbers. In the 2015-16 budget—that's the last year where we've been able to see exactly how the funding's been allocated between the states and territories—Queensland received just 12.9 per cent of the Australia Council's funding, despite being home to about 20 per cent of the nation's population—20 per cent of the population receiving just 13 per cent of the funding. That means Queenslanders are receiving about a third less than they should be on average when it comes to arts funding, and that's a far lower ratio than the residents of any other state or territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about jobs and it's about culture. Our defence industry focus has been about jobs—advanced manufacturing jobs and industry for Queensland—but the arts is also about jobs. It's a large and growing source of employment and an industry in and of itself. In terms of culture, I truly hope that that entrenched lower funding trend is not a result of any prevailing view in other states that Queensland is somehow a bogan state not interested in arts, because nothing could be further from the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Irrespective of the debates about the total amount of arts funding or the delivery mechanisms for that funding, the fact is that Queensland should be getting more equitable funding, and we see absolutely no reason for Queensland to be getting less. All 26 Queensland LNP members and senators have signed a letter which we've just sent to the Australia Council, asking serious questions about arts funding; the proportion received by Queensland, and regional Queensland in particular; and exactly what is being done about it. I'll continue to work hard, along with every single one of my colleagues—every other LNP member and senator from Queensland—to get a better outcome for Queensland's arts industry.</span>

My colleagues and I have railed about policy voids that have led to astronomical power bills. We've spoken out with concern regarding the government's proposed bandaid measures that involve reviving old power stations and dusting off the Snowy Hydro scheme. Labor has lobbied on behalf of constituents in rural and regional areas who have been hit hard by this inaction. In many instances, we've countered by attempting to impress on this government just how worthy regional Australia is of our investment. Yes, it's our food bowl. Yes, it's the gateway to our wealth and to our natural resources. But it is also the home of great people, the birthplace of great minds, and the mother of much industry and innovation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last month, the shadow assistant minister for schools, the member for Scullin, who is here with us in the chamber this evening, visited us in Paterson to speak with principals, teachers and learning support staff about the joys and the challenges encountered while working with people with disabilities. We visited Catholic, public, primary, secondary, independent and special purpose schools. Not surprisingly, the greatest problem encountered by staff on the ground was the funding shortfall. At one school we visited, 11 per cent of students have special needs. Of those, only one-quarter were nationally funded for special needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not far away, we visited the terrific Hunter River Community School, a school for specific purposes, which proves that children and families, who really have some incredible skills and attributes, have a dedicated education facility. It's the only one between Newcastle and Tamworth. And while I can proudly say that that school was built with BER funding, thanks to the Labor government, I must also tell you that it's at capacity, with its principal saying that it could actually double its places—that is the need in our area at the moment. This school is considered a centre of expertise for the way it differentiates the curriculum to cater for younger people with special needs and, in turn, it provides expertise to other schools around it that lack that expertise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A mainstream school that is innovating in the special needs space is Maitland High School. It has a fantastic cafe, which I visited last Friday. Andrew, you're going to have to come back and visit the cafe—it's terrific! It's been running for about 15 years, but it's a pretty wisely and tightly held secret within my community, and I'm hoping we can get it out there. Maitland High School is doing a terrific job. These students open the cafe; they cook the food; they take orders; and the public goes there and has lunch. It is absolutely terrific to see. I just want to encourage people to get along to Maitland High School in terms 2 and 3, when it's open. It serves, as I said, the community and teachers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other one that I want to tell you about quickly is Shear Abilities. It's a hairdressing salon that caters for people with severe disabilities. It has a lifting chair and it has incredible facilities. People who have disabilities can go there and have the experience of having a haircut and being looked after. Congratulations to Desiree, who has opened that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the many educators, support staff, businesses and workers within the disability sector who work to improve the outcomes for people with special needs. Paterson is so fortunate to have you, and I'm honoured to be your representative.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Last night when I went to bed I checked my emails. Most of us in this place probably have that email in which you get sent the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> the night before. I read the front page with incredulousness as to what I was reading. I thought, 'Surely, this is a bad dream. I'll put the iPad down, and it won't be the case when I pick it up tomorrow morning.' On the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> was another story about union corruption. The ALP's biggest union affiliate, the shoppies union, has been paying 10 per cent of member's dues in commission to Coles and Woolworths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a big boy. I've learnt through bitter experience that you don't always believe what you read in the papers, but here's a story written in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Aus</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tralian</span> by Ewin Hannan. This is an extraordinary arrangement which, if it's true, generously—one might argue—compensates supermarket giants by deducting union fees from the pay of thousands of their workers. Thousands of their workers are paying a fee to their employer via their unions. The fee turns out to be about 10 per cent of their union fees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder how many Coles and Woolworths employees actually know that some of their hard-earned dollars are being paid as a reward, as a commission, back to Coles and Woolies, for Coles and Woolies to encourage their workers to join the shoppies union. It's an absolute disgrace, if true, because some of these workers are the lowest paid in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an answer provided to a Senate inquiry, the shoppies union confirmed for the first time that the commission paid to Coles and Woolworths had been unusually high, 10 per cent of their union members' dues. It pays a lower 2½ per cent commission to KFC, and no payment is made to McDonald's to deduct union fees. In a statement to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> yesterday, union National Secretary Gerard Dwyer admitted that the arrangement, 'needed to be reviewed'. Why is it that all these arrangements need to be reviewed once they're under the spotlight? Woolworths revealed that the fee charge to the union would finally be reduced following the introduction of a new payroll system. Despite the union finally acknowledging the percentage amount, Coles and Woolies have continued to refuse to reveal the commission rate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The union has been under scrutiny over controversial pay deals with big employers, including Coles and Woolies, that contain zero or below-award penalty rates. SDA members pay annual union fees of between $205 and $509 a year. The Australian Electoral Commission records show Woolies and Coles passed on union dues totalling $7.95 million to the union's Queensland branch in 2015-16. That would suggest that these employees are paying somewhere around about $790,000 in undisclosed commissions to Coles and Woolies. This is absolutely extraordinary!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following questions from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, Woolworths said it had recently completed a review of the arrangement with the union and that they were going to reduce their commission down to $20,000 from somewhere around $400,000 previously. It's an absolute disgrace. Coles and Woolies should hang their heads in shame.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  Simonds Stadium in Geelong is home to the greatest football team in the AFL. That is not my opinion, it is a fact. If you don't believe me you should read the member for Fenner's book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economics o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f Just About Everything</span>, because it proves it. This year, Geelong finished second on the ladder. While two of the top four teams did play a home final, Geelong, despite finishing second, was not one of them. Geelong played our so-called home final at the MCG, a ground where we had played just five matches this year. Richmond, the so-called away side, played 11 matches at the MCG this year. They played that number of games because it is their home ground. For the privilege of coming second, we got to play on the other team's home ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be sure, Richmond played a great game on Friday night and would have won no matter where that game had been played. But that's not the point. I know the AFL will say that more Geelong fans were able to watch our team play on Friday because we played at the other team's home ground. But I say that is also beside the point. No other side in the competition has to give up home games for this reason, and I can't think of another side in the world that would. In 2015, Villanovense, who played in the fourth tier of the Spanish soccer league, were due to play host to Barcelona, a global giant of the game. Villanovense's home ground has 4,000 seats. Barcelona's home ground holds 100,000 fans. Do you know what? The game was played at the home team's home ground, for the very obvious reason that a home game is a home game. So don't tell me that a single Villanovense fan wished they had played at the other side's home ground and don't tell me that Geelong fans don't want to see Geelong play in Geelong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Simonds Stadium is a world-class facility. It is past time that we saw Geelong Football Club playing home finals on their home ground. Geelong president Colin Carter will tell anyone who asks that Geelong is missing out on millions of dollars because our home games are being played at the MCG or Etihad instead of at the Cattery. Here is a quote from Colin: 'It's unreasonable in competitive terms because often were playing it against the team that considers it their home ground and it's really unreasonable from an economic point of view because we make a half a million dollars a game more at Simonds than we do at Etihad.' And who could argue with that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past 15 years, Simonds Stadium has seen partnered investment by federal, state and local governments, by the Geelong Football Club and by the AFL itself. The first stage of the stadium's redevelopment, the now Hickey Stand, saw $14 million invested by the Bracks Victorian government and $6 million from the City of Greater Geelong. Stage 2, the Premiership Stand, saw an additional $14 million invested from the Rudd Labor government, $6 million from the Bracks-Brumby state Labor government and $1.5 million from the City of Greater Geelong. Stage 3, the Players Stand, took $26.5 million from the Victorian government—a legacy of the commitment that had previously been made by the former Brumby Labor government—$10 million from the Gillard Labor government and $3 million from the City of Greater Geelong. Stage 4, the Brownlow Stand replacement, saw $75 million from the Andrews state Labor government and $6 million from the City of Greater Geelong. It is a matter of pride that all these decisions were made by Labor governments state and federal. Sadly, the Abbott and Turnbull governments have shown their true colours and contributed nothing to this project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Simonds Stadium has been crucial for our city. It is the single biggest piece of sporting infrastructure in regional Australia. Sustained investment of taxpayers' money has given our city a wonderful asset. Now that we have it, we have to make the most of it. There is no point having a world-class stadium and playing games somewhere else. We will only get value from the investment the community has made if we play our home grounds at home. Since 2007, Geelong has played finals matches in every season except 2015. In that time, the Cats have played a grand total of one final match at our true home ground. No other team is required to play away from their home ground when they earn the right in finals. The idea that we are not using Simonds for any finals matches this year is unacceptable. The time has come, the ground is ready, the team is ready, the city is ready. It is time the Geelong Football Club played our home games on our home ground.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  I was humbled and honoured to address the EndoActive conference in Sydney over the weekend alongside my Labor colleague the member for Canberra. Together, the member for Canberra and I have formed the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness to end the silence on endo and finally achieve a proper policy response to this terrible condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate EndoActive organisers Syl, Lesley and Rod Freedman, and Lesley's book club, for their tireless and incredible work putting the conference together. I want to acknowledge and thank the medical specialists like Dr Susan Evans and Professor Grant Montgomery and educators like Deb Bush for giving their time to these women who desperately need answers, assistance and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise the inspiring, tough and resilient women living with this awful condition. We will do everything we can to work for the policy change we know these women and our future generations of young women so desperately need. That's why the member for Canberra and I today met with peak endo groups EndoActive, the Pelvic Pain Foundation, Endometriosis Australia, the Canberra endometriosis support group and QENDO to discuss what we can all do to create and implement change. We discussed the need for recognition, awareness, education and research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be taking these recommendations to the Minister for Health and the shadow minister for health. We will be hosting a formal launch of the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness later this year. This will provide an opportunity for the brave women who suffer this awful condition to tell their stories here at Parliament House. We will also outline the facts about endometriosis, a disease that afflicts one in 10 Australian women, along with 176 million women aged 15 to 49 worldwide. This statistic does not surprise me, as I personally know five women who suffer from this crippling condition, and it has had a major impact on their lives and their quality of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis causes the cells that line the uterus to grow as lesions in other parts of the body within the pelvis, causing inflammation, severe pain and scar tissue. These lesions can stick organs together so that women have to have parts of their bowel removed, their ovaries removed, surgery to their bladder or a full hysterectomy. When I talk about the pain of endo, I mean pain that is so severe women can't get out of bed to go to school, to university or to work. This may be pain during their period, but, due to the severe nature of the pain and the condition, pain can be present constantly. When pain is so regular it becomes chronic pain, which is far more complicated to treat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women delay consulting a doctor for years for their condition, in part because we fail to educate women as to what levels of period pain are normal and what levels of period pain are not normal and need medical investigation. When women do consult a doctor there is an average delay of eight years before they are diagnosed with endo. Commonly, they see health professionals like physios or bowel specialists before they see a gynaecologist. When they do see a gynaecologist things don't necessarily get better. Women may have multiple surgical procedures, or they may be told that they will be cured if they have a baby. At the EndoActive conference we learnt of girls as young as 12 being told this was the cure for them, which is just shocking and completely outrageous. I am grateful to Syl Freedman for the work she is doing on this. Other women are told that a full hysterectomy will cure them of their pain, but in many cases it won't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the sorts of stories brave women have shared on the EndoActive website. I was honoured to meet Hitesha, Bec and Tori in person at the conference, and I thank them for telling me about their experiences. I encourage everyone in this place to read their stories, like that of Marina, whose diagnosis took nine long years, four emergency-room visits, three surgeries and some questionable medical treatment that included questions like, 'Are you doing this to gain attention from your parents?' Anyone who has suffered chronic pain knows that this is a devastating and offensive thing to say to someone who is in constant or regular pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the pain and the lack of community and medical knowledge about this terrible condition that makes it so difficult to deal with; it is the interrupted school and university education, the struggle for women to hold down a job and the struggle for them to have a baby and start a family. For too many years women have suffered in silence. That's why the member for Canberra and I are doing our small part to end the silence on endometriosis. We're working with the dedicated volunteers at EndoActive, the Pelvic Pain Foundation, Endometriosis Australia, the Canberra endometriosis support group and QENDO to end the silence on endo.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the very sad passing of a good friend of mine, Viv Maher, on Wednesday 16 August after her battle with pancreatic cancer. Viv touched the lives of many over the years as a teacher, social worker, Aboriginal elder, social activist, mother, grandmother and feminist. She was born in the small Victorian town of Warragul, approximately 100 kilometres east of Melbourne. She married Jim Maher less than 12 months after they met before they made their way to PNG in 1972. Jim had an opportunity to install one of the first computer systems in the country. Viv completed her studies in Port Moresby, where she took on a job as a social worker at the Port Moresby hospital. Her choice to study was a turning point, enabling Viv to pursue her passion in social work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Viv was one of the special people you hear about in life, a one in a million, who put others first. After returning to Australia, her activist nature was ignited by an issue at the Frankston hospital, which had a policy of not permitting pain medication for unmarried women at the time. Viv quickly took up the issue with the board of the hospital and needless to say she got her way. That's the kind of person Viv was. She would see injustice and act. Viv also worked at the local Centrelink office in Mount Gambier. A story told at her funeral a couple of weeks ago made an impression of many. When Viv worked as a social worker she would often see some of the most vulnerable people requiring help getting food, paying the bills and maybe needing a bit of cash to get through the week. Viv was always there to lend a helping hand, sometimes allowing small loans from a so-called 'special fund' for special cases. She would make the client sign a form, making it formal process, but tell them on the quiet they didn't need to repay the money. You see, there wasn't a special fund for emergency cases. When someone was down on their luck, Viv used her own money to help, but to make them feel better she would tell them that story. That's the kind of person Viv was. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Viv also gave her first-born to the Labor Party, and Kyam is now a minister in the Weatherill government. Her son summed his mum up by describing her as a 'towering feminist, champion of and for the Aboriginal community, fierce advocate for social justice and fierce but terrible singer.' Our thoughts and condolences go out to Viv's family and friends. She will be missed. She's survived by husband Jim; Kyam and Carmel, with grandkids Marley, Flynn and Jai; Cameron and Carol, with grandkids Oliver, Fletcher and Jake; and Gibran and Xiang, with grandkids Felix and Maverick. Her spirit lives on in all of them.</span>

Viv spent much of her life in Mount Gambier, and she is well known to me. We spent a lot of time on polling booths together. I always looked forward to manning a booth with Viv because it was always good fun—the way it should be. We had the kind of banter you would expect in a campaign. The member for Hindmarsh is exactly right—she was a champion for the community and a lion of the Labor cause. So vale Viv—my thoughts are with Jim, Kyam and all the family. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday I attended the official opening of the Naracoorte Men's Shed. We are lucky to have so many fantastic men's sheds in Barker. I enjoy them, as they are a reminder of how members of the community can come together and make a massive difference to the health and wellbeing of individuals, which in turn makes for happier, healthier communities. They do so quietly, without fanfare and fuss, but the impact these organisations have on our community is outstanding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Men's sheds help men, particularly as they get older, to connect with each other and prevent social isolation and preventable health conditions. They provide a sense of community, a safe and friendly environment where men can work on many projects at their own pace, in their own time and in the company of others. This may not seem groundbreaking stuff, but I have seen firsthand how these simple things can make a massive difference to the health and wellbeing of individuals. The men's shed movement has now become one of the most powerful tools in addressing men's health and wellbeing. The men's shed movement helps to raise awareness of mental health issues, because, let's face it, Aussie men are not that good at looking after themselves, either emotionally or physically. Men's sheds are vital community investments. These community based organisations deliver activities that foster community spirit, cultivate social collectiveness and contribute to building a more inclusive Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Shedders' devote most of their time to worthwhile community endeavours that deliver great benefits to the wider community, such as undertaking major projects, donating arts and crafts, participating in community events and actively promoting men's health and wellbeing. Through local partnerships and community collaborations, men's sheds create stronger local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mannum Men's Shed, in my electorate of Barker, is another fantastic example. They work with 25 community organisations within the Mannum region, meaning that not only does the shed directly benefit those involved with it; it also benefits the community. Shedders deliver great benefits to the wider community through major projects and other activities. As a member of every men's shed in the Barker electorate, I'm pleased to be in the parliament crowing about this movement, particularly as we approach Men's Shed Week, scheduled to commence on the 25th of this month.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I rise today to speak of a very special event, a very special community, and a towering figure who graced my electorate with his presence on Friday morning, with over 1,000 people in attendance. Last Friday, His Holiness Pope Tawadros II, 118th and current Pope of Alexandria, Patriarch of the See of St Mark and leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church, consecrated the St Mina and St Marina Church, which is located in Hallam. Gathered amongst his enormous flock, he blessed this inspirational church, which is truly an iconic religious site in the City of Casey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">St Mina and St Marina Church, in Hallam, was established in 1991 and the new church built in 2012. The current church clergy is headed by my good friend Father Abanoub Attalla. The church seats up to 1,200 people and has dedicated classrooms for Sunday school services. As I said to His Holiness, this marvellous building can be seen from the Princes Highway and many parts of my electorate. To me, this place of Christian worship has always inspired two emotions—and, I suspect, in the Coptic Christians in my area—faith and hope, two emotions that I suspect have sustained the Coptic Christian community in spite of ongoing persecution, systematic harassment and murder of its members. In the past five years they have had to endure horrific suicide bombings that have killed and injured many Copts. In fact, His Holiness himself was targeted in attacks earlier this year. That he was present in my electorate to consecrate this lovely Coptic place of worship meant so much to the Coptic community and to the many leaders who attended this service. It is an unfortunate fact that evildoers are still intent on silencing this great spiritual leader, so this meant intense scrutiny by Victoria Police and the AFP during that day. I would like to thank all of the serving officers who kept us safe during the service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To say there was an air of wild excitement would be to understate the impact of the presence of His Holiness at the church. I was honoured to present him with an Australian flag that was flown in Parliament House on that day. I spoke about the persecution of his ancient faith and the slaughter of innocents—now called martyrs—by the cold-blooded killers who want to extinguish Christianity in the Middle East. To them I say now: you will fail. Remember this: nations rise and nations fall, people are born and people die, but faith endures. It has endured for millennia, and it will endure now. You will not extinguish this faith, particularly when there are great spiritual leaders like His Holiness Pope Tawadros. He is the rock of his church against the waves of hopelessness and despair. So, do what you will, but that faith will endure. It will prosper and, particularly given great spiritual leaders like His Holiness, it will continue into the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  I rise today to mark Friday, 1 September, which was Jersey Day, a very important event sparked by a family in my electorate who came up with this initiative to raise awareness of the DonateLife Network as part of the Organ and Tissue Authority. As we know, in May 2015 Kylie and Michael Gremmo lost their son, Nathan, 13, in a terrible accident on his way home from school. From this tragedy sprang a great hope from this remarkable family who, true to their character, chose to donate Nathan's organs. This difficult decision and this family experience—and this profound gift that they gave to the world, which saved six lives, five young adults and a baby—sparked Jersey Day, which has become a national phenomenon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year we saw key entertainers, including the Wiggles, as well as the NRL, the Prime Minister, the minister for ageing and people all around the country don a jersey to show their support for DonateLife and start those vital conversations within families about organ donations, remarking that Australia continues to have a very low rate of organ donation. This is the third year that Jersey Day has been in place, and it's a great and growing success. We're very proud of the Gremmo family locally and nationally. They run a much loved and respected business in my electorate. Their attitude towards the tragedy within their own family has really seen them show and demonstrate to the entire country—and I think to the world—what you can do, what can spring out of such awful events and what can occur when you have that inner strength to care for others and seek greater meaning from an awful tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is still a lot of work to be done. About 1,400 people are on Australian organ transplant waiting lists at any one time. Wait times can be up to six years for healthy, compatible organs. One organ and tissue donor can transform the lives of 10 people or more. Thanks to developments in the clinical sector, Australia is now a world leader in successful transplant outcomes. Improvements are also being made nationally; 2016 saw the highest number of organ donors in Australia since the beginning of record keeping, and 503 deceased organ donors gave new life to 1,447 Australians. It's because of initiatives like Jersey Day and what the Gremmo family have done that we know, in conjunction with the DonateLife Network, that these strides are being made, and we expect to see many more strides in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You're never too young and never too healthy to register as an organ donor. It is a tough conversation, a controversial conversation, that takes place within families. But this family, the Gremmo family, with the loss of their young son, saved the lives of six people. It's this kind of tragedy combined with this kind of heroism, this kind of conversation, that can spark a change in the lives of so many people. It's a vital conversation, and I encourage it. I want to thank the Gremmo family for the work they've done over the last three years. I look forward to this being an important conversation every year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  On Saturday, 9 September I attended the sixth Australian National Hindu Conference, organised by Vishva Hindu Parishad Australia and held at the Adelaide Convention Centre. I was joined by many dignitaries and parliamentarians, including federal colleagues Senator Penny Wong and the member for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas, as well as South Australian Governor Hieu Van Le.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forty Hindu associations from across Australia participated in the conference, including Hindus from India, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Bhutan and Nepal. Australia's Hindu community is making remarkable progress with its settlement in Australia and its contribution to Australian life. The Australian Hindu population is currently around 440,000, and over the past 10 years Hinduism has become the fastest-growing religion in Australia. Hindu contribution extended across all walks of Australian life, but I particularly acknowledge the focus Hindus have had on professional and postgraduate professions. Professional and higher education levels amongst Hindus greatly exceed the national average, and it is a great credit to the Hindu people that they place such importance on education. Through those professions, the Hindu community has enriched, strengthened and advanced Australia. Simultaneously, the Hindu community has initiated its own community participation programs, including but not limited to education, culture, sport, children's programs, welfare and the environment. It's remarkable how varied is the input of Hindus in Australian everyday life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">VHP is a not-for-profit community organisation that embraces a theme that the world is one large family. That couldn't be more evident than in today's world, where we constantly talk about globalisation. This year's conference theme was 'Strengthening Communities, Stronger Australia'. The theme was so appropriate and so relevant. None of us live in isolation. We live in communities where each of us contributes to our own life and the lives of others. It is our collective contribution that creates our society and all the benefits that come to us. Importantly, when we are united our collective contribution will strengthen not only communities but our whole country. The VHP focus on that theme is a wonderful example of our Hindu migrants' commitment to Australia's future and their allegiance to Australia, and shows that they want to see Australia grow and prosper. I thank the VHP for their warm welcome to the conference, for the very professional way in which the conference was managed, and for showing how Australian Hindu people can contribute even more to Australia's future. In particular, I commend the national president, Subramanian Ramamoorthy, and the state president, Rajendra Pandey, for their leadership of the association.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  Contrary to the mantra of the sixties, plastic is not fantastic. I rise to say no to single-use plastics. That means no straws, no plastic bags and asking people, instead of buying bottles of water, to refill their existing ones—all pretty simple when you think about it. I speak of the issue of plastic following the recent screening of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Plastic Ocean</span>. Plastic pollution is not just an issue here in Australia but a global issue affecting our oceans, health and wellbeing. However, organisations like Plastic Oceans Foundation Australia are working to change the world's attitude towards plastic within a generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Plastic truly is one of the world's great environmental challenges and surrounds us in our everyday lives. Through societal failure to dispose of plastics correctly, our environment is suffering. In fact, with more than eight million tonnes of plastic finding its way into our oceans every year, behaviours and plastic disposal methods must change. Do those who undertake the weekly shopping and come home with everyday plastic bags full of other wrapped items realise that these plastic bags can take up to 60 years to degrade? Annually, we use approximately 500 billion plastic bags, each with a working life of 15 minutes. Too often people take plastic for granted and give no thought to the environmental ramifications of disposal. Think about the marine life that unknowingly consumes a plastic product believing it to be food, then consider that perhaps a fish higher up the food chain will eat that animal, which has a gut full of plastic. Perhaps this fish will be served up on your plate at a later date. It may not seem like a great deal when you dispose of your used drink bottle, but its sometimes questionable destination is an underlying issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I meet constituents who share concerns for the environment I share my concerns about the plastic islands in our oceans. These trash vortexes occur in gyres in the major oceans. One example is the 'great Pacific garbage patch'. Simply put, the ocean's circulating currents collect masses of rubbish in a never-ending cycle. The problem occurs during the photodegradation of plastic, which expends particulates in the water. This continues until the process reaches a molecular level. Some of it may even end up in our digestive systems without us knowing. You would not eat a plastic bag, so why subject our oceans to such vile rubbish? I encourage and challenge all members here today to reuse plastic items in order to start a behavioural change. If our oceans die, we die. With 70 per cent of our oxygen produced by marine plants and 97 per cent of the earth's water contained in the oceans, we need to change our actions and we need to change them now.</span>

                  </span> Seventy-five years ago last week, we defeated the seemingly invincible Japanese army at Milne Bay. Next week it will be 75 years since the tide turned on the Kokoda Track and the Japanese would start to retreat. I haven't heard much said about this lately in the media or in this place, and that's a shame. These battles were the most important we have fought. The men who fought and died there didn't go for adventure or to defend an empire; they were repelling an army that had never been beaten and that they thought was about to invade Australia. Not many of these men are still with us. One, who is, is my mate Dick Payten. He is 96 and still going strong, and I love him very much. Two weeks ago we were at the War Memorial here in Canberra.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were only about 20 people there. He was the only Kokoda veteran and I was the only member of parliament. There on that cold Canberra morning—it was minus four—we listened for two hours as the names of the 641 men who died on the Kokoda Track were read out. The oldest was younger than me. The youngest was only 16. I wish we were all as determined as Dick is to make sure that his mates are never forgotten. I took him back to Papua New Guinea five years ago and we visited the grave of his best mate, Arnold Darling, at Bomana War Cemetery. It is a moment I will never forget. This is what he said: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take this opportunity to talk about the campaign that I'm backing in my electorate of Forde to fix the M1. It is a simple message of just three words, but it rings loud and clear in my electorate every single day. The M1 highway continues to be the single biggest issue in my electorate, affecting every single local family and every single local business. I have no doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the constituents in your electorate of Wright might also be affected by what goes on with the M1. This is why I have thrown my support behind this new local campaign that aims to lobby all governments to find a solution to this nightmare—for that is what it is. The campaign includes a new video that calls on locals in our community to come together in a single, concentrated effort to lobby governments to find a solution to the MI highway problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The M1is a national highway and the federal government has played a significant role in making sure this road connects our nation, moves our economy, helps us showcase our country to the world, and, importantly, is up to scratch. I give kudos to the infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, for being prepared to be involved and committed to the discussions about how we provide a solution to this problem. It is a national highway and it's an absolute necessity that it remains on our national agenda. The biggest issue on this highway is the congestion, not the freight task. It has a different responsibility; it is a fifty-fifty funded road. That is where the state government also needs to stand up and be part of the solution, not part of the roadblock. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is one of the fastest growing areas in Queensland if not in Australia. If we do not continue to work to find a solution to this problem, as we continue to pack more and more residential and industrial development into the Gold Coast-Brisbane corridor, this problem is only going to get worse. We will see next year with the Commonwealth Games, I hope, that the traffic solutions provided between now and then help reduce the problem so that people stuck in traffic are not a blight on the Commonwealth Games. This government has focused on providing funding for a number of problems, and we will continue to fight to solve this problem for our community, and I commend that to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  For many businesses in Parramatta and across Western Sydney there is a crisis coming. It is a crisis in power prices, and for some it's already here. One local business told me that they're facing an increase in December, and according to their brokers it will be between 160 and 200 per cent in direct electricity costs. They've already been told by their major multinational customers that they'll not accept the effect of this increase and will move their sourcing offshore, forcing the business to follow them to Asia. I don't want to focus on what went wrong—enough of that is going on out in the ether. But I do want to ask the question: when costs go up like this in a market, why aren't solutions being found locally? That is what usually happens—prices go up and businesses move in. With solar and battery options it looks like there could be business opportunities out there that aren't being exploited. I can already hear my local manufacturers saying that they're not power companies, and they don't have the expertise to go it alone and that's probably quite right. But why isn't somebody else moving in to capitalise on these rising costs and the opportunities to produce power locally at a lower cost?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the current circumstances in our business parks, you'll find high-energy-use businesses that use so much power that, even if they installed solar panels on every square inch and grid in their garden beds, they couldn't cover their power bills. But next door there is a logistics company that has huge roofs and very low power costs. Why can't they trade? It goes beyond sharing roofs. High energy businesses already smooth out their usage as much as possible to avoid paying the peak usage for the whole month. They bring that peak down by smoothing out their power usage. What if businesses in a power hub smoothed it out between them? What if somebody worked out the combined roof space, the different usage patterns, the most efficient combination and offered those roof owners a deal? What if businesses within the power hub cooperated, within reason, to rearrange some of their peak usage, and where there is no business usage for current patterns they simply moved it. Why isn't someone else forming a symbiotic relationship within the group of businesses and matching businesses with different input capacity, usage patterns and different roof capacities to keep power usage smooth and minimise battery storage requirements? It would help to reduce the power bills of businesses, and those of their customers and suppliers. It's a win right across the board. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It might also be useful, as regulators increase the use of demand management to smooth power usage, if platforms existed across power hubs that predicted power use, how much was in storage and when it would be used. Why isn't it happening? Well, a local expert in Parramatta is making it happen. We've already got enough businesses in a week to go to trial, but we are looking for more. So if you're interested in participating or being kept informed, just send my office an email—no obligation, you won't get spammed: Julie.Owens.mp@aph.gov.au. The answers are out there, and we're going to find them.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge National Threatened Species Day and the importance of that event for my electorate of Durack. You may not be aware that my electorate has the largest number of threatened species in Australia. There are some 360 different species considered to be vulnerable or on the brink of extinction. That is a very frightening number. More frightening, though, is that Australia-wide the number is 1,700. This federal government takes conservation work seriously but realises that there needs to be a balance between the needs of all land users and action to protect plant and animal species extinction. This is a tight balance, but it is one I believe can be achieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the appointment of the Threatened Species Commissioner some two years ago, we took a step in the right direction in terms of raising the profile of conservation efforts, and through the $1 billion we contribute to the National Landcare Program. Also, only last week we announced another $3 million for 17 different projects, with respect to the Threatened Species Recovery Fund. I believe we're on our way to stopping the high rates of extinction that we've seen over the last 200 years. I'm very pleased this government has committed to the funding levels of our Landcare program for another seven years, which will provide continuity and confidence for our natural resource management groups going forward. We don't want to see our wombats, koalas or bilbies go the same way as the Tasmanian tiger, and we do not want future generations to think of these animals with the same strange mythology with which we view the Tasmanian tiger. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to encourage conservation efforts, and I have stood up in this House many times and spoken about the importance of conservation, particularly with respect to the work of a successful Indigenous ranger program, of which I have many throughout my electorate. I'm very pleased to see the work that some of my local NRMs are doing in Durack, and their list of achievements is incredibly impressive: from cane toad management in the Kimberley to wild dog fence work in the Murchison to marine debris clearing in the Mid West. There is some really vital work being done by these groups in our regional communities, and I want to congratulate them. Most pleasingly, their efforts are assisting to bring land back from the brink. Through sustainable management of land, we can turn dry, lifeless land into usable land for our agricultural industry, which, as you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, has just become our No. 1 industry in terms of GDP growth—a big shout-out to the farmers in Durack. I support the farmers of this country, which is why I strongly support the NRM network and the hard work that they do in maintaining sustainable land and workable land in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time remaining, I want to acknowledge the WA Threatened Species Forum, which was held in Geraldton last Friday and at which I happened to be a keynote speaker. This event was proudly supported by the NRM WA network, which is made up of seven regional NRM groups. It was a fantastic event, and I want to congratulate them for all the fabulous speakers they had. I enjoyed myself very much, including all the wildlife. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  The Greens have for a long, long time called in this parliament for a royal commission into the banking and financial services industry. We have had Senate report after Senate report and expose after expose of people who have lost their house and/or their life savings all because a bank sold them something that worked in the bank's interest but not necessarily in their interest. What we have also seen very clearly throughout all of those inquiries is that parliamentarians of all stripes and with the best intentions will do their hardest to get to the bottom of what is going on in our banking system. But when a banker fronts up to an inquiry and wrings their hands and says, 'We made a mistake,' and walks away and then comes back again a few months later and we find that no-one has lost their job as a result of it, that the practices might still be continuing, it becomes crystal clear that what we need is someone who can commit to and conduct that inquiry but do it with the powers that they need so that they can find out what is going on behind closed doors, so that this parliament and the people get more than some serial hand-wringing from bank executives, and we actually get a change in culture. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite some time ago, the Greens in parliament moved a motion for a royal commission; but, sadly, we didn't have many friends at that stage. Labor didn't vote with us, the Liberals didn't vote with us, but we did have some support on the crossbench. It's testament to the fact that, when there are people in parliament who will stand up for what is right, a good idea can ultimately win. Over time, the opposition have changed their position and come around to the idea of having a royal commission—and that's good. We're a vote or so away in the House of Representatives from calling on the government to have a royal commission. But what has become crystal clear is that, as long as the Turnbull government are in place, they will do the banks' bidding and form a protective shield against the banks. So there's something we can do in this parliament before the next election, where there may well be a change of government, and that is use the powers of the parliament. If the government is unwilling to step up and use the executive to call a royal commission, then parliament can step in and do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we need a commission of inquiry. That's what a commission of inquiry is: it's parliament saying the people and the public interest should trump what the executive wants to do, because the executive is only acting as a delegate of the power of the people, and it's also saying that parliament should trump the interests of corporations and some of the biggest corporations in this country. That is why commissions of inquiry can exist. It's because it's the ability of parliament to then say, 'This issue is so important that it is time we established a full and wide-ranging inquiry.' It's why commissions of inquiry exist, why they have been used in the past and why they should be used now—too many people have lost too much.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of the Australian banking industry is a conflict. On the one hand, every one of us can't get by now without a bank account. We're funnelling money regularly through banks and financial institutions. They have a guaranteed income stream from us. The big four banks, as we saw during the global financial crisis, have the implicit backing of the government behind them. They know that if they ever get into trouble—because we have a too-big-to-fail, four-pillars policy in this country—they will get public support. But on the other hand, they have a business model that is based on fleecing people. It's not based on looking after and curating people's deposits with the maximum of care, as the other arm of the banks' business model is to sell us all products that are about increasing the banks' profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard too many tales of people who have been hurt, ending up with products that they don't need, simply because the banks' primary obligation is to their shareholders. If the big banks in this country want public support and government support standing behind them, there should be a quid pro quo. They should open their doors and open their books, and a commission of inquiry is the best way to make that happen.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  Those opposite did absolutely nothing about the Australian banking system during their time in office, and this government is taking action now on a very wide range of fronts. Let me run through a few of them. Firstly, there are interest rates. The ACCC now has the power to go into the banks and get documents about the process by which banks set interest rates. When the banks say they had no choice but to raise interest rates because of external factors, the ACCC will now be investigating that exact issue. They will be going into the banks, getting the board minutes, getting the interest subcommittee minutes and determining whether or not that is in fact the case. That's a very good thing for competition. It's happening because of this government, out of the House's Standing Committee on Economics inquiry. It's a very, very positive development. It's happening now. All Australian bank executives should be on notice that representations about interest rate policy settings are now subject to internal ACCC scrutiny. That's a very positive development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also setting up the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. Previously, there were three different authorities in this area. It was quite confusing for consumers to know where to go and who to talk to. We're now setting up a one-stop shop for complaints against financial institutions: the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The outcomes will be binding on those institutions. When the authority makes a decision, consumers can pursue claims up to $500,000 and small business can pursue claims up to $1 million. There's no need to go to court and spend the large amounts of money involved in court proceedings. It's a very, very important reform implemented by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also implemented the Bank Executive Accountability Regime. It's true that there has not been enough accountability in senior executives in banks, as we have seen from the failures in the banking system. What we saw and what we recommended in the House's Standing Committee on Economics inquiry was for an executive accountability regime to be established. The government has done that. What we are seeing is that fines of up to $200 million can be enforced by APRA if banks are in breach of their prudential obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also going to require the banks to have a very clear map of who's responsible for what so that there can't be finger pointing within banks to say, 'It wasn't my area; it was that person's area.' That will all now be set out in a very clear document, which will mean there is nowhere to hide and the bank executives who are responsible for divisions in which there is malfeasance will be held accountable. That's a very important development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen concerning allegations recently regarding the Commonwealth Bank and its conduct in relation to cash deposits. These are allegations made by AUSTRAC which are very serious in nature. The government has set up an inquiry, led by Dr John Laker, the former chairman of APRA, and also supported by former ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel and company director Jillian Broadbent. This inquiry is looking specifically into the Commonwealth Bank's issues of governance and culture. It will investigate those issues and report back to the government by January with an interim report focused on the issues within the Commonwealth Bank. It will identify any problems and make recommendations to government about the ways in which the Commonwealth Bank should improve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have competition. One of the problems in the Australian banking system has been a lack of competition. For instance, in the last decade there was only one licence issued for a new start-up bank in Australia. That's unacceptable. Consequently, we're changing the rules so that it will be easier to get a bank off the ground. Previously, you had to have $50 million of cash before you could even get a banking licence. You can imagine that, if you are trying to raise the money to get a bank off the ground, asking people to give you $50 million on day one, before you've even got a licence, is a very difficult thing. So now there will be a two-stage process. People will be able to get a bank off the ground with a much smaller amount of funds and then get a full banking licence later. That is what's happened in the UK in recent years, and we've seen several dozen new entrants to the banking sector as a consequence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are very important reforms across a whole range of areas, including on accountability of banking executives, ensuring focus on competition and giving consumers a one-stop shop to address the problems they have with banks. This government is taking action very aggressively across a wide range of areas in the banking sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me great pleasure to move this motion, as I'm a strong supporter of the government's Building Better Regions Fund. I understand the enormous benefits it can bring to a local community such as my electorate in the north of Brisbane on the Sunshine Coast. It still truly remains a regional area. The main focus of the Building Better Regions Fund is on creating jobs, driving economic growth and building stronger regional communities.</span>

I can assure you that, when this work is finished, we'll really be able to roll out the red carpet and dress this place up to welcome everyone, even the Queen.' Mr Smith's comments came on the back of the results of round 1 of the Building Better Regions Fund in which the Events Centre in Caloundra was successful in being granted $3 million for upgrades to the centre. Mr Smith is a long-term supporter of the Events Centre, having dedicated much of his time in recent years to securing funds for vital upgrades to the facility. Mr Smith's comments relate to his dogged determination to ensure that any upgrades to the centre included a porte-cochere that would be fit for the Queen. Once these upgrades are complete, that is exactly what we will have. Mr Smith's next job is to try and get the Queen to Caloundra!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Events Centre Caloundra is an important piece of infrastructure that provides a world-class cultural experience for local people based on the Sunshine Coast, but it also draws tourists from all over South-East Queensland. The project, which, due to this grant, is expected to be completed by the end of 2018, will have an array of transformative upgrades. The project will improve the acoustics of the main theatre and upgrade the foyer, the bar, the verandah cafe and box office facilities. It will also upgrade the heating and air conditioning throughout the building, it will increase accessibility at the main entrance and it will install toilet and lift facilities for patrons with a disability. Because we are actually celebrating Disability Action Week in Queensland this week, I'm very proud to be announcing an upgrade which will see much greater facilities for those with a disability. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nationally, the Building Better Regions Fund received more than 500 applications, and the Events Centre Caloundra was one of around a hundred that were approved. More applications were received under the Infrastructure Projects Stream than in any of the three funding rounds conducted under the previous National Stronger Regions Fund. I'd like to extend my personal congratulations to all of those worthy community groups across Australia who successfully received funding through these grants.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Round 1 of the Building Better Regions Fund Infrastructure Projects Stream has been highly competitive, with the applications received demonstrating significant strength and quality across the three project sizes. Strong applications were able to describe and quantify project economic benefits in the short and long term, and how they would deliver social benefits in the region. There was also a need to demonstrate that the project was both viable and sustainable, and that it would be delivered on time, on budget and to the standard required for important infrastructure projects. The Events Centre Caloundra ticked all of these boxes, and their success is testament to the importance of this facility to Sunshine Coast locals, the huge effort that the team put into consulting with the locals and preparing their application, and the groundswell of support we received from the community. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Regional Queensland, and in particular North Queensland, has been facing some very tough times. Our unemployment rates and youth unemployment rates are amongst the highest in the country; Townsville is the insolvency capital of the nation; and, in the last five years, we have had three massive cyclone events—however, this has not always been the case. We also have a large population of veterans and ex-service personnel who want quality employment opportunities. During the global financial crisis, whilst unemployment was around 10 per cent in Brisbane, unemployment in Townsville was less than five per cent. Fortunately, Townsville's economy was diverse enough to survive the GFC. But that has not been the case for the residents on Palm Island, in my electorate. Lack of infrastructure and jobs have always been major issues for this remote community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 2012 and 2015, regional, rural and remote Queensland experienced the wrath of the Newman LNP government, and now, after four years of the coalition Abbott-Turnbull governments, Townsville has really felt a significant negative impact and is, as I said, the jobless capital of the nation. LNP governments are not the friends of regional, rural and remote Queensland. This is borne out by recent history and the savage cuts made by LNP state and Liberal-National federal governments. LNP governments have always looked after their city mates at the expense of people living in regional, rural and remote Queensland, especially in first-nation communities. The Turnbull government have done nothing to address the growing rate of inequality in regional, rural and remote Queensland; in fact, they have just added fuel to the fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the GFC, whilst unemployment has been on the decline in Brisbane, wages are on the increase. Compare and contrast this to North Queensland, where employment is on the rise, and the only thing dropping is wages. Life expectancy is lower in regional, rural and remote Queensland. There are more households with no access to the internet in regional, rural and remote Queensland than in capital cities. Insurance is higher in regional Queensland than in Brisbane, even though Brisbane experiences more regular and severe weather events. Townsville has the highest homeless rate per capita in the nation. Rates are higher, energy prices are higher and the overall cost of living is higher. Inequality in regional, rural and remote Queensland is on the rise, and the Turnbull government is doing nothing to rectify this situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More focus and action is needed in regional, rural and remote Queensland, and deservedly so. We need short-, medium- and long-term solid plans and not just bandaid solutions. In particular, urgent attention must be paid to the regions that have been identified for rapid population growth. It is concerning to note that the regions with the highest projected growth rates are the same regions being excluded from capital works grants like the Building Better Regions Fund. To help build the vital infrastructure necessary to prepare for the rapid growth, the government has little to offer these communities. In fact, these regions are almost excluded from the $500 million Building Better Regions Fund, the $220 million Regional Jobs and Investment Packages and the new $200 million Regional Growth Fund despite their urgent and obvious needs. This situation must be reviewed because much needed growth is dependent upon the funds to address the necessary infrastructure that will guarantee this sustainable growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding projects are just one piece of the puzzle. It is not just about dollars. We also need to set our priorities. This includes our value proposition and social capital. The government needs to understand the real social dividend that comes from local projects and not just short-term ribbon-cutting opportunities. The decisions regarding the best bid must consider more than dollar value—they must also include social capital. Delivering a one-off, short-term project based on cost alone will do very little in the long term. However, the same project that has a genuine local focus, including local jobs, purchasing local resources and services and local manufacturing opportunities that may be slightly higher in cost, will deliver real economic and social benefits in regional communities in the longer term. This will enable local small businesses to build their capacity to create more jobs. Funding that takes these elements into account will build both a strong and growing local economy and a thriving society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Awarding tenders and delivering funding that is focused only on the initial cost and not the broader picture does not take into account the positive flow-on effects for regional communities. The Building Better Regions Fund needs to address this crucial focus. The Sunshine Coast is not regional, rural or remote Queensland, and the differences are blindingly obvious. I demand action from the Turnbull government to provide the funding that will deliver community capacity building and local jobs for all Townsville residents, including the residents on Palm Island and our ex-service personnel and veterans.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="125865" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr McVEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  Today I rise to recognise our government's foresight and commitment to building better regions across Australia. I'm a proud resident of the Darling Downs. My parents, my grandparents and my great-grandparents before me were residents there as well. My family tree of McVeighs and Mearas is proof that regional Australia can support ambitions and efforts across the generations. My family put down roots in the amazing, cracking black-clay soils of the Darwin Downs, and those roots are still there today. There are five generations, with my children's generation starting to make its way in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The city of Toowoomba is the beating heart of the Darling Downs, and it would be safe to say that it would be unrecognisable to my great-great-grandparents today. Toowoomba is a city of some 116,000 people and is perched on the Great Dividing Range. In the latest round of the Building Better Regions Fund, a life-changing project in our city was successful. The dream of having a purpose-built permanent home-base facility for LifeFlight emergency medical helicopters is becoming a reality. The funds, which were a partnership in the true sense of the word, were provided through the coalition government's Building Better Regions Fund, which provided $2.05 million; local businessman and philanthropist Clive Berghofer, OAM, who provided $1.87 million; and LifeFlight Australia, which provided $171,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The money will replace existing ageing buildings with new purpose-built aviation facilities, including hanger capacity for two AW139 helicopters, aircrew accommodation, administration operations and a flight-simulator room. It will be a boost for our regional community as the project will create 350 jobs during construction and, more particularly, will enhance the entire healthcare chain throughout our region. Most importantly, it will provide more vital aeromedical services to people throughout our region of south-west Queensland, be they farmers, miners, locals or tourists. This type of project continues to build the future for our region so that families like mine will continue to stay and prosper, or, as many of us do, go away and see the world before realising there is nowhere that compares to the Darling Downs and return home. The LifeFlight project is an example of a significant project enhancing our community on the Darling Downs, but it is also an illustration of broader Australia and the benefits that can be achieved in regional Australia in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As chair of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I know there is huge potential for economic growth in regional areas. The government's Building Better Regions Fund is part of the investment in the futures of these regions. The government is doing this as it wants to partner with regional communities to build confidence across the entire nation, as regional communities are the lifeblood of this country, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker. We need to capitalise on the strengths and local resources we know our regions offer. We certainly need to focus on required infrastructure and community facilities for growth in regional Australia. But we need to recognise, at the end of the day, as this government does, that so much of Australia's economic prosperity is generated from our regions, from mining to agriculture, from education to health, to innovation and other advances, particularly in new industries. There are many rural and regional towns doing great things across the country to foster economic and social development in their communities. This government is committed to seeing that continue to happen, hence efforts such as the Building Better Regions program. We are committed to regional growth, long-term employment opportunities and sustainability in these communities across the states and territories of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a passionate supporter of regional Australia and I believe Australia's regions remain the key to unlocking our future growth and potential as a nation. Why? Because, like those generations of McVeighs and Mearas who went before me, we understand, in our case, the Darling Downs. We know its challenges, we know its successes, and, like so many others who live in regional Australia, we know there is tremendous growth potential throughout our entire nation. The government's Building Better Regions program recognises just that as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I'd like to join the member for Fisher in congratulating the successful applicants of round 1 of the Building Better Regions Fund. In my electorate of Mayo, two applications were successful: $202,000 is going towards a sculpture trail on Kangaroo Island, and $255,000 has been allocated to the construction of a men's shed at Victor Harbor. I have previously spoken in this House about the Victor Harbor Men's Shed, and I reiterate my support for men's sheds right across Australia. They are integral community spaces, they are places where there's a great deal of support, mateship and, indeed, love for each other, and I believe they save lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I visited the Victor Harbor Men's Shed last year, I was delighted to see men, young and old, working side by side sharing their skills together—although I must say it was quite a tight squeeze in the men's shed! Thanks to the grant funding they've received, the Victor Harbor Men's Shed will be able to relocate to larger premises. They were previously operating out of the Encounter Centre—a great resource for our community—but they only had one day a week. This move will allow them to be open every day and help foster stronger relationships throughout the community. An organisation such as this is exactly the reason the Building Better Regions Fund is so valuable to regional communities. Similarly, the construction of the Kangaroo Island sculpture trail will add another great drawcard to Kangaroo Island and it will be a great boost to our economy there. The trail will show the natural vegetation of the island, the local wildlife, and include large sculptured works created from natural materials. I greatly look forward to its completion and disembarking at Penneshaw and having a good look around myself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Building Better Regions Fund is a genuinely good initiative. Investment in our region is so important to enable communities to grow and thrive, and I strongly support the intention of the program. That is why I'm so frustrated at the rules regulating eligibility of access to the fund being based on mapping. I have spoken on this issue previously, but it's inconceivable to me that a township such as Woodside in my electorate, with a population of just 2,000, cannot access the fund while the Gold Coast, the sixth biggest city in Australia, can. Mount Barker, the major economic centre of the Adelaide Hills, cannot access the fund. This is a town projected to have a population of 44,000 in the next 20 years, and the district population will grow to 56,000 in the same period, yet we lack so many of the essential services that a town with such a population demands because we have been such a small regional community. For example, our swimming pool is not up to competition standard—it's still in yards and feet—and it leaks into the surrounding ground. The recently announced sports hub will allow more football and soccer competitions, and that is desperately needed in our community, but what we need is Mount Barker and surrounding areas again being part of the Building Better Regions Fund. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the Gold Coast is gearing up to host the Commonwealth Games next year, and it has two professional sports teams and the facilities that come with it. It is a large economic centre that receives millions of dollars each year from tourists visiting the city. I don't think you will find many who are willing to say the Gold Coast is lacking in essential services and community infrastructure. Indeed, I think you will find very few people in Australia who consider the Gold Coast a region. The minister spoke to me about my concerns and she said at the end of round 1, in July this year, she would have a review of the boundaries. As yet I have heard nothing from the minister. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia is at an impasse, with our manufacturing industry closing down and unemployment rising. We must look to the next opportunity and I believe that next opportunity for South Australia is in food production and agriculture. It always has been, we just never realised it. In the Adelaide Hills these industries are crying out for major infrastructure projects to allow them to best display their talents to the world. This is why it is so important that these areas, true regional areas that rely on primary production for their prosperity, are allocated into the Building Better Regions Fund. While it is tremendous that we congratulate those who were successful in round 1, I would urge the minister to review as quickly as possible how they have drawn the boundaries for the Building Better Regions Fund, because it seems ridiculous that small towns with no public transport, small towns where you are lucky if you have one or two stores and a thousand people, where the banks have closed and everything has gone, cannot access this fund. For us not to be included and for places such as the Gold Coast to be included makes a mockery of the term 'regions'.</span>

For the people of Maranoa, an electorate that covers 42 per cent of the state of Queensland, and particularly for those in rural and regional areas, this has been a boon. During the roll-out of the Building Better Regions Fund we have seen, only in the last round, an announcement of just under $5 million for a new cold storage facility in Warwick that will bring 150 new direct jobs, 138 indirect jobs and 80 jobs during construction. This is a significant investment in the community of the Southern Downs. It is also a sign of faith in rural and regional Australia. To bring more than 200 new families to a community of just over 12,000 people is a significant change in the economic make-up of that community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are proud to say that rural and regional Australia has a future, because if we have a strong rural and regional Australia we have a strong nation. My electorate alone, Maranoa, contributes more to the GDP per capita than Townsville, Toowoomba or the Gold Coast. That is without taking into account the three coal-fired power stations that generate more than 50 per cent of the state's electricity. That is all coming out of my electorate of Maranoa—rural and regional Australia. All this is important investment, and we can couple that with another investment out in Morven for a rail hub, worth just over $4 million, to bring cattle in from the west, to provide security for those people in rural and regional Australia who are in the cattle industry. It will also provide them with more competition, because if we can move their product then we will have competitors wanting to bring in their product. If we have got Oakey Beef wanting to secure this hub and bring cattle in on the train, rather than on trucks, it will also mean that Oakey Beef's competitors will be looking to secure supply for their abattoirs. This is a real economic boon for the people of Morven, a little town of only a couple of hundred people. This investment will bring a rail hub to Morven that will ensure we can bring in cattle from all over this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other investment we've made is a $204-million investment in aged care in Blackbutt, a little community in the South Burnett. Two hundred thousand dollars will go towards independent living for those who are disadvantaged—for those who are unable to afford to get into one of dearer aged-care facilities. In this small community, we are giving people options and choice so that they don't have to leave. They can still have their family around them and have the dignity and respect in their ageing years to be able to stay and be part of that community. It's an important investment in that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Previously, our government proudly invested in the rebuilding of the Waltzing Matilda Centre, which burnt down some two or three years ago. I have to call out Mayor Butch Lenton—an absolute outback legend. This is a mayor who leads. He doesn't make his community a victim; he gets on with the job. He's fought droughts; he's fought fires. The man is a leader, and he's a leader who every Australian should be proud of. In the little outback town of Winton, with just over a thousand-odd people, he is helping to rebuild the Waltzing Matilda Centre—a national iconic centre that every Australian should be proud of. It will bring new jobs to that community. Winton has nearly 50,000 visitors a year, in tourism, to the Waltzing Matilda Centre and the Age of Dinosaurs museum. It is a significant investment in that community, because we are diversifying the economic base of Winton to not only rely on agricultural but also rely on tourism—to put another pillar in that local economy. That's an important investment in that community. Ensuring 40,000 to 50,000 visitors a year go to a small town that has a population of only a thousand people is a significant investment that will ensure that community has greater resilience as we move forward. It will also ensure that we continue to look at this as an investment in rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that, if we make that investment, we are the economic engine room of this nation. We understand that, if we invest in rural and regional Australia, we will continue to ensure that the whole nation's economy benefits. We are the ones who are putting the product on the boats that are empty once they bring their stuff into this country. We proudly, as a government, have sought to ensure the security of and investment in rural and regional Australia because it makes economic sense. I'm proud that this motion has been put forward. I thank the member for Fisher, Mr Wallace, for putting it forward. It's an important one for rural and regional Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise to object to this motion being put today on the grounds that, historically, this government has changed what was once an Australia-wide possibility to apply for Commonwealth funding for community programs, for builds, that might have created jobs and community infrastructure. In the past, under a Labor government, this was the RDAF. I note that this government left it as it was until just this last round when, mysteriously, the boundaries changed and areas of this country were cut out of applying for this grant. I stand here as the member for Lalor whose community was a recipient of this grant under this government, but not this time. We were not allowed to apply. Someone applied some maps and put some boundaries in—exclusive boundaries, I might add.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I congratulate all the communities who did the hard work of applying for this grant, I note that in Victoria communities around Ballarat, Corangamite, Murray, Gippsland, McMillan, Flinders, Mallee, Indi and Wannon are all recipients of this round but that the electorate of Lalor was locked out of this process. I condemn this government for the changes that it made to this program, locking out communities like mine and locking out electorates like Holt, both of which are in growth corridors. We don't have to go very far to find that people living in growth corridors feel that they are doing it tough and that they are being neglected by this government. But this grant process is one area about which we can clearly say is an opportunity that we have been cut from, that our applications have been disallowed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at the electorate of Lalor, there were lots of things. In fact, our local government already had prioritised projects where they were going to seek support from this grant until those boundaries were changed and until a growth corridor, like the city of Wyndham, was locked out of this level of support. The city of Wyndham could have applied for a new station at Black Forest Road with the Regional Rail Link. They are keen on that as a major project, as an extension of a Commonwealth program under a previous Labor government. We could have applied for some support in upgrading our irrigation, which we have failed to get under this grants program and we have failed to have funded under the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund program. We could have applied for support for our catalyst sites to reset the Werribee CBD as an employment hub for locals. We could have applied for building funding for BizBuddyHub, which is a collection of microbusinesses in my community. They desperately need somewhere to set up so that they can collaborate, share costs and innovate together. There are things that we would have and could have applied for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, there were things that we were already looking at as a possibility of being part of this process, and we were locked out. One can only assume that we were locked out. When you look at who was funded this round and when you look at those boundaries, it is pretty clear that this government doesn't recognise that growth corridors might need extra support. At the rate our area is growing, it is turning into a population of 230,000 people halfway between Melbourne and Geelong. I note that, under this program, the city of Geelong is still considered to be regional, but Wyndham City has been cut from this program. For the people I represent, me coming in here today and hearing people celebrating the grants that have been provided or will be part of their future just highlights this government's lack of attention to detail and lack of attention to the growth corridors—not just the one I represent, but growth corridors around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be remembering, as the National Growth Areas Alliance tells us, that five million Australians live in growth corridors, where LGAs and local communities are struggling to keep up with the exponential growth that's happening all the time. In my community we are building recreational facilities at a rate of knots to keep up with the growth. This program could have offered some support to the community that I represent, but this government chose to lock us out of the process and lock us out of our capacity to join the rest of Australia in building for our region.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I'm quite surprised that there's nobody else from the government side to speak on this motion, given the fact that it's their motion. They claim to be the parties that represent the regions but they are not here to speak on it. Apologies that I was late to stand to speak then; I just would have thought that they would want to speak on their own motion. Maybe it is because they realise that it's an absolute joke of a policy that the government have put forward and they are a little bit embarrassed by what has happened in their first round of the Building Better Regions Fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note that this isn't the first time a federal government has had a funding stream available for our regions to tap into. Under Labor it was called the Regional Development Australia Fund and it was a genuine commitment to work with local, state and federal governments to build the infrastructure that we need in the regions. As my friend and colleague the member for Lalor pointed out, it acknowledged all areas of the regions—like our outer metropolitan areas, with their cross-section of outer metro and regional—and the need for infrastructure in those areas. Those are areas like Werribee and parts of Western Sydney, where they are feeling the pressures of growth. These are regions, and this government is choosing to ignore them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government got elected, they scrapped the Regional Development Australia Fund and the role that our RDAs played in ensuring that these areas were priority projects. The government then had the National Stronger Regions Fund. In motion after motion of the last parliament, we heard about how great that fund was. It wasn't as good as Labor's fund, but it did help deliver for places like Bendigo. We did receive funding under that grant scheme for our airport. We did receive funding for the redevelopment and the building of an aquatic centre. It was a project and a guideline that we could work with and that our region said it was able to access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, what we're seeing from the Building Better Regions Fund, the BBRF, is a really confusing model. There are two streams now, an infrastructure project stream and a community investment stream. For the infrastructure project stream, as we have pointed out, those successful grants have been announced. They line up with a lot of election commitments made by this government at the last election. This also highlights where they were focused. Perhaps, unfortunately for Bendigo, we didn't make the list and the cut for funding because we weren't a target seat. It's just another example of pork-barrelling by this government, particularly in the state of Victoria—funding for Gippsland, funding for Corangamite, funding for Murray, funding for Flinders, funding for McMillan, funding for Indi, funding for Mallee, funding for Wannon. Bendigo, in Victoria, is the second-biggest regional city, after Geelong, and did not get $1 of funding. It was not because our council didn't apply, not because local businesses didn't apply and not because not-for-profits didn't apply. We had a number of projects go forward but they missed out. And I ask the question: is it because the National Party and the Liberal Party didn't believe that Bendigo was worthwhile, that they just crossed over Bendigo and made very few commitments at the election?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A complaint has also come from my region about the community investment stream. Those announcements haven't been made. Perhaps that's because, in the case of the minister who's involved in making these decisions, there's a question mark over their citizenship. Perhaps the decisions have been delayed because if they made an announcement then they could be challenged. We don't know whether they've been elected and whether they should be sitting in this parliament. These are projects where, again, there are questions about the criteria for this particular stream. You could apply for amounts from $10,000 up to $10 million. How do you compare projects—$10,000 to $10 million? What are the criteria the department has to work with? We can't get access or information about this. A couple of community groups and organisations as well as local governments who've made applications under the stronger investment stream of this particular fund are saying to us that they've had no word. They applied back in March and have had no word. The events, the projects, are going ahead, and they don't know whether they've got funding from the federal government. All they get is a wall of silence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to go back to the model Labor had when we were in government, the Australian regional investment fund, where we worked with local government, we worked with state government, we worked with our RDAs—a model that worked in Victoria—to deliver the projects that our regions need. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing funding to Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia will cause the loss of expert trauma specialist counselling and will also reduce the number of trauma specialist counsellors available and working in Australia. The Turnbull government is allowing its for-profit contractor to cut funds from Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia and redirect those funds to other organisations. The other organisations are well respected domestic violence organisations, but the cuts will mean that Australian victims and survivors of family and domestic violence will have less access to specialist trauma counselling. Minister Porter must explain how the Turnbull government will ensure that victims and survivors have access to specialist trauma counselling and how the government will either avoid the redundancy of up to 70 staff members or fund their severance payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia has been the sole provider of specialist trauma counselling for the 1800 RESPECT service since that service's inception. Now the Turnbull government is giving the for-profit firm that manages the contract for the service, Medibank Health Services, the green light to reduce RDVSA's funding by 75 per cent by moving to a panel system. The money will be reallocated to three other organisations. The new organisations joining the panel are well-respected, not-for-profit, state based domestic violence crisis services. No-one would question their experience in providing excellent and crucial support to women in crisis, including information and referral services. I've visited some of those services myself, and I've seen firsthand the excellent work they do with victims and survivors of family and domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government could certainly take action if it wanted to start taking on responsibility to fund or partly fund crisis support to complement the support that is already provided by the state jurisdictions or if it wanted to support greater consistency and coverage across state lines for those services. Any new support for crisis services should not, though, involve any reduction in the work already being done by the Commonwealth to give effect to the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to reduce violence against women and their children 2010</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Cambria Math;&#xD;&#xA;  font-style:italic;">‐</span><span style="font-style:italic;">2022</span>. Any new support for crisis services should not involve a reduction in the availability of trauma counselling services. They serve different purposes, and both purposes are important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">1800RESPECT has, since its inception, provided a specialist trauma-counselling service. Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia has operated for much longer than the inception of 1800RESPECT—in fact, for almost 50 years. In 2011 its executive officer, Karen Willis, received an OAM for her work in relation to violence against women. The consequences of the reduction in funding to RDVSA, together with some new contract conditions that have caused it to have serious ethical concerns, have seen RDVSA decide not to accept the new arrangement. Those ethical concerns have been about requirements including an obligation to hand over client files and to allow voice recording of trauma counselling. The Turnbull government has yet to say how such voice recordings would be excluded from obligations under subpoenas across the country. In other words, how will the Turnbull government make sure that victims' telephone conversations with counsellors—no matter where the victim is in Australia; no matter where the service is in Australia—won't be obtained by violent perpetrators in the course of litigation and played aloud in court?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the proposed new panel arrangement RDVSA would have had 50 staff redundancies, but walking away from the contract will mean 70 staff redundancies. Those are the figures RDVSA has provided, yet we're told that staff support the decision to walk away, even though it means more redundancies, so strong are their concerns about the proposed new arrangement, their apprehension that 1800RESPECT would become an information and referral service rather than a trauma counselling service, and their worries about the ethical ramifications. This latest change to the service, to reduce access to trauma counsellors and transform the service so it focuses on providers that have traditionally worked in information and referral rather than specialist trauma counselling, comes after the Turnbull government and its for-profit contractor, Medibank Health Solutions, last year started diverting callers away from RDVSA's specialist trauma counsellors to less-qualified people in a first-responder triage process which was heavily criticised at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government needs to say how it will make sure that Australian domestic, family and sexual violence victims and survivors and their supporters have access to specialist trauma counselling. The Turnbull government also needs to say what it will do to avoid the loss of up to 70 experienced frontline domestic and family violence and sexual violence staff from this nation's workforce. It also needs to say how the severance entitlements of these frontline workers will be covered in the event that the Turnbull government is unable to prevent the redundancies. Finally, the government must not fail to honour its commitments to the other panel organisations who have entered into this process in good faith.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241590" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak today on the motion of the member for Griffith regarding a significant issue facing our community. Domestic violence and sexual assault are serious and real issues that we must tackle across Australia, and particularly on the Central Coast. These crimes affect deeply the lives of many individuals and families in our communities. It's crucial for those families and victims to know they're not alone. That's why the government is committed to ensuring that there is high quality and accessible support available for those facing, or who are at risk of facing, sexual assault and domestic violence situations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">1800RESPECT is an outstanding national service that provides counselling for members of our community affected by sexual assault and domestic violence. Services like 1800RESPECT give many vulnerable people a place to turn to in order to seek the professional help they need at a time when they need it most. While I thank the member for Griffith for shedding light on this exceptional national service and the work of many victim support organisations, it is unfortunate that this issue arises in such a manner, because the focus should be on helping those that these services assist—the victims of the crimes of family violence and sexual assault—instead of using it for political pointscoring. I note that Labor has claimed that, due to a supposed 75 per cent reduction in government funding, the 1800RESPECT service has been negatively affected, yet the government has not, nor does it intend to, reduce funding for the 1800RESPECT service; quite the opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is undertaking a major effort to make 1800RESPECT the best service of its type in the world. We've worked hard at turning around a system that was failing to help victims of domestic and family abuse and sexual assault. In fact, I'm advised that the service had previously only been answering 33 per cent of calls. That meant that around two-thirds of people contacting the service didn't get to speak to a counsellor. Worse still, of those calls that were answered, waiting times to get to a counsellor were more than 10 minutes. I think all sides of the chamber today can agree that this is unacceptable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response, in 2014, the government committed $3.8 million to Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia to see more calls answered. Unfortunately, this failed to change call answer rates. The government commissioned an independent report on the best way to improve the service. One of the key outcomes the report recommended was a triage systems with counsellors with a three-year degree and minimum two years counselling experience to answer the calls. This has meant that many calls, like simple requests for information, could be dealt with immediately. What's more, if callers required more specialised counselling, they were transferred to an even more experienced counsellor, so they didn't have to retell their story. The improvement was immediate. Now I'm told that more than 90 per cent of calls are answered with an average wait time of 37 seconds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now continuing our process for improvement of 1800RESPECT and putting an extra $5 million a year into the service until December 2019. In this financial year, this will see over $19 million in total provided to 1800RESPECT. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also finalised its tender process for the trauma specialist component of the service, which was due to expire. The minister has advised that four highly skilled and respected organisations have offered to take part in a new panel arrangement and, across the four trauma specialist partners, the $5 million extra funding will be used to increase the number of trauma specialist counsellors from 31 to 48. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia have refused to take part in the panel arrangement, citing a loss of revenue and privacy concerns. However, the minister assures me that, because recordings and file notes of counselling conversations are the subject of legislated privilege, the counselling communication is protected. I'm further assured that every effort will be made to absorb staff from Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia across 1800RESPECT, and additional money will be used to provide training to all 1800RESPECT. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Running a campaign with the Australian Services Union against our government on such an important issue is not what the Labor Party should be doing. What we ought to be doing together is talking about how we can best help people in crisis in raising awareness in our communities. There are a number of important events that are being organised across our country for White Ribbon Day—for example, on Saturday 25 November. In my electorate, there is always an incredible show of support from the local police area command, businesses and families as together we walk up The Skillion in Terrigal. It's a walk I have joined for a number of years now, and I intend to do so again. I call on all speakers to unite and focus on backing important services like 1800RESPECT, and I invite the opposition to do the same.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this motion. I congratulate the member for Griffith in advancing this issue. I had to visit a couple of weeks ago Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia, which is in my electorate, to speak with staff following the organisation's decision to withdraw from the 1800RESPECT counselling service. This was not of course an easy decision for RDVSA to make. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For almost 50 years, RDVSA have provided specialist sexual assault and domestic violence trauma counselling. Its staff are highly qualified. RDVSA uses the Standards of Practice Manual for Services against Sexual Violence, which requires counsellors to have a tertiary qualification in counselling, social work, psychology or equivalent, and at least three years counselling experience. The organisation is well-known for this expertise, and its executive officer, Karen Willis, has received an AOM for her work in relation to violence against women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its inception, 1800RESPECT, which is an important Labor legacy—and RDVSA has been the sole provider of its specialist trauma counselling, assisting women living with domestic violence nationwide. The decision to withdraw from the 1800RESPECT counselling service follows a series of decisions made by the Turnbull government and lengthy negotiations with Medibank Health Solutions. In October 2006 RDVSA's contract with the Turnbull government expired, and the contract for 1800RESPECT was put out to tender. While the Turnbull government has announced the 1800RESPECT service will continue, RDVSA will see its funding slashed by 75 per cent, with this funding allocated to three other organisations. It would also be required to operate as part of the MHS call centre model. MHS, of course, was not subject to an open-tender process. The quality and experience of these three other organisations is not under dispute. Each plays a critical role in their respective states assisting women living with domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue here is with the Turnbull government's decision to slash RDVSA's funding by 75 per cent, which will see a reduction in the specialist services they offer, and a loss of jobs. The previous speaker, with respect, said they could just go to work for one of the organisations that has been offered a contract. If they were to do that, it would require these women, with families, to move interstate. It is not that simple, and the government knows that full well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government should be looking at ways it can facilitate the growth of organisations like RDVSA. The fact is that new support for crisis services should not involve a reduction in the availability of much needed trauma counselling services. But for RDVSA this decision to withdraw is not just about the reduction in funding. It's also about some of the new contract conditions, which have caused serious concerns. These ethical concerns are about requirements that include an obligation to hand over client files, and to allow voice recording, and we are yet to be told how these voice recordings would be excluded from obligations under subpoenas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If RDVSA had accepted the new panel arrangement, the organisation would have seen 50 staff redundancies. As it is, withdrawing from the contract means 70 staff redundancies. We've been told the staff support this decision, because of their many concerns about the proposed new arrangement. This last change to the service, to reduce access to trauma counsellors and transform the service so that it focuses on information and referral, rather than specialist trauma counselling, comes after the Turnbull government and its for-profit contractor, Medibank Health Services, last year started diverting callers away from RDVSA specialist trauma counsellors to lesser-qualified people, in a first responder triage process. The Turnbull government needs to say how it will make sure that Australian victims and survivors of domestic and family violence and sexual violence, and their supporters, have access to specialist trauma counselling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government also must say what it will do to avoid the loss of 70 experienced frontline domestic and family violence and sexual violence staff. These are committed people—I have met with them. They're very upset that they won't be able to continue to do the work. The Turnbull government also must say how the severance entitlement of these frontline workers will be covered. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  What would actually be appropriate is if we just were polite and calm and listened to people rather than trying to distract, because what we just heard was that the focus of this motion for some people is mostly about employment terms and conditions of people who work on the service, rather than the people who need that service. A number of members sitting opposite are 100 per cent right: this is actually about people who experience the tragedy of sexual violence or sexual assault and family violence, and making sure they get the support and care they need.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be focusing on outcomes and supporting the people concerned and perhaps being a little bit less concerned about inputs, because the reality is, if you can reform a service to improve outcomes for people who are experiencing tragedy within their lives, that is far more important than protecting the interests of people who happen to be in employment who may be represented by unions or other groups as part of the political process.

                  </a>  I make no apology for standing up for victims of domestic and family violence and making sure we have services that provide for people based on need. The comments from those opposite, who seem to want to dissuade against that motion and that proposition, are doing them a disservice. They should be ashamed of that conduct. When it comes down to it, we have a service that is designed to assist people who have faced issues of domestic and family violence. They need support. The fundamental focus of the reforms that are being proposed by this government is making sure we get the best outcomes for those people and making sure that non-profit organisations that are able to provide those services to those people who have been victims of violence meet the best standard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there have been some issues with the service in the past. This is not a partisan comment; it's a reality that has prompted the government to take action. The non-profit organisation Medibank Health Solutions has accepted the invitation that from October 2017 it will work with various other community organisations to provide the support and care necessary for people who have been victims of domestic violence. It's critically important that those services are provided in a sensible, rational, private and confidential way. As many of the people on both sides of the parliament in this chamber know, people who are experiencing issues of family and domestic violence or issues of harassment need privacy and confidentiality. That's why the new arrangements that are in place for the privacy of callers will be upheld. The contractor has been advised. It will take the privacy of calls very seriously and comply with all Australian privacy legislation and policy. That's fundamentally a good thing. That's about a policy that focuses on outcomes and improving the assistance and care provided to people who are victims of domestic and family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The law will also focus on the protection of confidential counselling communication. All trauma counselling service providers will be subject to the same legal protections and requirements concerning the production of confidential records of communication with victims of sexual assault. That is another important principle and provision as a foundation for making sure that people get the assistance and support they need in times when they experience the tragedy of violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the heart of the proposal being put forward by this government is actually about outcomes and making sure those who need support and assistance get it. The helpline needs to be available at times when people are at their most vulnerable so we don't have situations where people who are vulnerable have their calls delayed or diverted because there isn't the support and assistance. If you care about the outcomes that are faced by people who suffer the consequences of domestic and family violence or sexual assault, you should be supporting the efforts by the government. At the heart of our focus is: how do we improve the lives and situations of people who do not deserve the situations that they face? It's always disappointing when we see that being turned into a partisan political proposition focused on the interests of those people who have not always delivered the best outcomes in the past.</span>

                  <a href="263328" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HUSAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:08</span>):  I'm pleased to speak out against this government's privatisation of rape and domestic violence services, and I am pleased to support the member for Griffith's motion. I am curious and interested to see the member for Robertson, the member for Boothby and the member for Goldstein, who is sadly now walking out the door, here to speak about the service. The member for Goldstein tried to turn this into union bashing. I hope they have a thorough understanding of what this government that they belong to, led in this case by Minister Porter, has done to this service and why they think making money off the back of rape victims is acceptable. I assume they don't, but I find it criminal that they could be in here in support of privatising rape services. A woman, man or child at their most vulnerable as a victim of rape is now a dollar sign in the eyes of the Turnbull government. The contempt the government has for victims is breathtaking, and the contempt in which it holds the rules and upholding them is absolutely shocking. It presides with a born-to-rule mentality, and I am happy to call it out. Asking professional rape and trauma counsellors to break their industry's code of ethics is riding roughshod over them in the interests of making money and not providing thorough support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can understand how government members can come to this conclusion. If you have never needed 1800RESPECT, if you have never been raped, or if you are not one of the one in three people who have experienced domestic violence, it could be easy to reach a conclusion like this. If they haven't been a victim, I say to them: lucky you. But, with the vulnerable people who have been raped, bashed or traumatised, we owe it to them as our duty of care to ensure that the services are available to them, no matter what. Why shouldn't victims and survivors of rape and family violence get the best possible counselling service available? What possible justification could the government come up with for this to take place? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Porter has attempted to create a diversion from this. Of course he would, because we know he hates to be called out on dudding the people of this country. He has blamed 1800RESPECT's provider, Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia, saying they declined to be a subcontractor on the panel. I can assure the minister he got that right—of course they did. The offer made to them by Medibank Health Solutions was an offer that a professional organisation could only refuse. There was no choice but to withdraw. The decision was not taken lightly by RDVSA—a service, let me remind you, that has operated for almost 50 years and is recognised internationally for its expertise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, clearly, we now know how to do business with this government. If you are willing to trade your values, your ethics and the quality of your counselling services and, most importantly, monetise rape victims and turn them into cash cows, then you can have a contract. If those opposite don't understand what they support, because they don't care about victims, they should consider the statement made by the Medibank Health Solutions director: 'Medibank Health Solutions is to double its profit from sexual assault and domestic violence over the next five years.' With a statement like that, should there be any question whatsoever in the mind of Minister Porter and the minds of those on the opposite side about the goal of Medibank Health Solutions? Does Minister Porter understand that the primary outcome of this service should not be making money but saving lives and reducing the trauma felt by someone who has been raped or bashed? He would have to be a pretty bland breed of special to not understand how profoundly poor that statement is, based on the nature and the content of the services they provide. Since when did we profit from victims of rape, let alone double our profits from victims of rape and domestic violence? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm astounded that this government has not intervened. But why would it—it is only in the national strategy to reduce violence towards women? And we now know that reporting rates have risen and access to this service is being driven by demand. This is poor legislation led by a poor Prime Minister, who is more committed to running a $122 million opinion poll on the rights of people before the law. What a shame he isn't as committed to the rights of rape and domestic violence victims. But I bet that come White Ribbon Day in November or the international day for eliminating gender violence this Prime Minister will again talk a big game. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone else who cares about rape victims and wants to see an end to domestic and family violence should think long and hard at the next election about supporting the Liberals, because the Liberals cannot be trusted to support victims of rape and domestic violence. Defunding Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia from providing, on time, the critical service that provides the absolute support these victims need is a demonstration of the Liberals' lack of commitment to the women, children and men who have been raped or traumatised by family violence. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245550" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FLINT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  I feel it's necessary to set the record straight on the Turnbull government's funding for the 1800RESPECT helpline after the contributions of those opposite. Whilst most of this motion is non-contentious, the allegations that our government is not doing everything it can to empower victims of domestic violence and sexual assault are simply untrue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I acknowledge the important work of Rape and Domestic Violence Services over recent years, we must be doing more to ensure that victims of domestic violence and sexual assault are getting all the help they need. When we came to government, 67 per cent of calls to the 1800RESPECT helpline, run exclusively by Rape and Domestic Violence Services, were left unanswered. Of the minority of calls who did get through, they had to wait an agonising 10 minutes. This situation left vulnerable people without an appropriate level of support or a service that could be relied on. With two-thirds of victims' calls for help going unanswered, this government implemented a plan to fix the helpline. We urgently undertook an independent review of the system, after which an emergency triage system was put in place in August 2016. This was called the first response model, and it has significantly improved the service. I'm proud to be able to stand here and say that the 1800RESPECT helpline is now answering 93 per cent of calls, and the average call wait time is down to just 37 seconds. This is a staggering improvement, but we're not going to stop there. We have increased funding for this vital service by $5 million in the most recent budget, bringing our total funding to $19 million in 2017-18 financial year. To put this into perspective, that means an extra 17 full-time specialist trauma counsellors available for victims of domestic violence. Now with a total of 48 counsellors, the service has never been this comprehensive or well funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next opportunity for us to improve the service came this year when the current contract for the provision of the service came up for renewal on 1 July. In keeping with our principles of good governance, we directed Medibank Health Solutions to conduct a tender process to determine the best way of managing the service into the future. Medibank Health Solutions offered four invitations to leading Australian not-for-profit organisations, including Rape and Domestic Violence Services. By their choosing, Rape and Domestic Violence Services refused the invitation to participate in operating the 1800RESPECT helpline. That was their decision and, as such, it was outside of the government's control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion before us talks about the change in funding to the service, but it doesn't say that the funding is being reallocated to other leading not-for- profit organisations, nor does it highlight our government's continually growing fund for domestic violence support services. This motion is not about fact. It's a rather poor attempt at political pointscoring and playing games. Domestic violence and sexual assault, however, are not playthings to be used for dishonest short-term political gain by the opposition and those opposite, and for them to do so is grossly irresponsible and dangerous. Allow me to put this question to those opposite: how many vulnerable women might hear the Labor Party's lies about reducing funding and think, 'Well, no-one's going to answer my call, so there's no point in me calling for help.' It's disappointing that just when we get this service working—which was a mess thanks to Labor's mismanagement—they would spread the harmful lie that the government is not 100 per cent behind those who have been subjected to domestic violence or sexual assault. It's simply not the case. The Labor Party should be joining me in congratulating our government for prioritising support for victims by outlining the huge increase in service funding, and thus encouraging those affected to pick up the phone. This thoughtless scaremongering from those opposite needs to stop, and they need to work with us to develop even better policies to address these very serious issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the Turnbull government has been putting its energy into. We have escalated the national conversation and invested more funding than ever before. No Commonwealth government has ever invested this much in this area. In addition to our $100 million Women's Safety Package, which includes specialist domestic violence units around the country and new technologies to assist women experiencing domestic violence, we have launched a powerful national information campaign to change attitudes about violence and disrespect. This builds on our $100 million in new funding for domestic violence measures announced in the 2016 budget, and includes $30 million for legal assistance. With all these policies in mind, the government's commitment to addressing domestic violence cannot be doubted.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  I thank the member for Griffith for raising this very important motion. Though it is only on occasion that both sides of this House agree, I'm sure we could come together and unanimously agree that victims and survivors of sexual and family violence deserve our support. They have a right to it. I'm sure that everyone would agree that they should be able to gain access to professional counselling support of the highest standard available. For people who have been through as much as these women, children and men, and for people who have suffered through this much, it's the least we can do. That's why I rise here today. I rise to join with the member for Griffith to call upon the Prime Minister to ensure that these victims and survivors continue to have access to the best specialist trauma counselling available—because, following a recent announcement by Medibank Health Solutions, it's clear that the quality of service offered is about to take a really significant hit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 1974, with support and funding from the Whitlam Labor government, Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia was established. Since that time, it has achieved international recognition and acclaim for the work that it does for victims and survivors of rape and domestic violence. Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia, or RDVSA, has been the sole provider for the 1800RESPECT specialist trauma telephone service since it was established—that is, until now. Now the Turnbull government is giving Medibank Health Solutions, the for-profit firm that manages the contract for the service, the green light to change the existing arrangements that, to date, have been largely successful in offering specialist support to victims of trauma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new arrangements include changes to contract conditions, as well as a new funding model—a new funding model that will see public funding that has typically been solely allocated to RDVSA reallocated to include three other organisations. This amounts to a 75 per cent cut to the funding RDVSA receives to administer 1800RESPECT—75 per cent of its funding. Even a one per cent reduction could be devastating, let alone a cut of such a significant amount. That's not to say that the new organisations don't do great work; of course they do. Each of the new organisations is well respected. They are not-for-profit domestic violence crisis services. But therein lies the difference: these are crisis services, not trauma services. Whilst both services are important, they do serve very different purposes. Any new support for crisis services should not come through a cut to existing trauma counselling services. Since 1800RESPECT's inception, it has been a specialist trauma counselling service, but the new arrangements will see a fundamental change to this lauded service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If RDVSA were to accept the proposed reduction in funding, it would result in 50 staff redundancies in their organisation. But RDVSA have turned their backs on the new contract, which will result in an extra 20 redundancies. That means a total of 70 people that assist in providing these vital services to Australian victims and survivors of rape and domestic violence will lose their jobs. Yet we're told that the staff of the RDVSA support this decision. The staff of the RDVSA are so concerned about the new arrangements that they would rather lose their jobs. That's how concerning these new arrangements are. It's not just concerns that relate to the lesser service that would be provided with less funds but also the serious ethical concerns that exist within the new contract conditions. The most alarming would probably be that the new contract conditions include an obligation to hand over every single new and existing client file from the 1800RESPECT service to Medibank Health Solutions, and allow voice recording. Can you believe this? The Turnbull government has yet to say how much of the voice recordings would be excluded from obligations under subpoenas. But I think the aim here is to compel the handover of new and existing client files under 1800RESPECT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not right to let a for-profit service determine how much public funding is allocated to such an important issue. It's not right to dilute a dedicated trauma counselling service by dividing the work among service providers that typically serve another purpose. It is not right what the government is allowing to happen to 1800RESPECT and RDVSA, and I won't stand by quietly and let this happen.</span>

                  <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  With the member for Griffith and my colleagues on this side of the Chamber, I rise to register my absolute rejection of this new arrangement that's going to be put in place by Minister Porter and this government when it comes to the 1800RESPECT service. I know this service well and I know many people that have relied on this service. I know Karen Willis and the people from Rape &amp; Domestic Violence Services Australia, and I know their reputation. I have visited that service in the past, and I know Karen personally. Karen, her staff and that organisation have 50 years of experience. How can a government ignore, not understand, not respect and—most importantly—not listen to 50 years of experience? I met with Karen Willis and the ASU last week. They explained to me very carefully the implications of the decisions this government has taken in relation to the 1800 RESPECT service. I won't go over the ground that has already been covered by my colleagues, but the ground that they have covered very well is the importance of trauma counselling. That's what we are talking about here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my discussions with Karen she explained carefully—and it's not hard to make the emotional and intellectual leap to understand what she was saying—that trauma counselling is often about people who experienced sexual violence when they were children and have finally found the capacity and had faith in the 1800 RESPECT trauma counselling service to be able to finally address those horrors. That does not happen in the case of someone who is less qualified than the people who have been doing the counselling service with RDVSA. It requires patience. It requires several conversations. It requires long conversations. It is not just about registering that you want to talk to someone, and certainly not someone who is less qualified than the present counsellors working out of their kitchen or lounge room.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like other members, am not saying that the people and the organisations who will now be taking on this tender are not reputable, good organisations. But what I am saying is that the very nature of this service is being changed, from a trauma counselling service to a service that does not deal with trauma counselling, that is a referral service on sexual violence and domestic violence. It has been outlined clearly why RDVSA have not proceeded with the tender. It is not, as the member for Boothby just outlined, that somehow or other they just decided not to. That is an insult to the people at RDVSA. It was, as my colleague the member for Lindsay outlined, because of deep ethical concerns about the people whose voices have been recorded and the information on files that will be required to be handed over. This government is compromising the very safety, the very confidence—that some of this information could end up in the hands of violent perpetrators in litigation and played aloud in court. For someone who has been sexually assaulted as a child and has finally gone to get some support for that, this prospect will stop them from seeking that support. And the very idea that this is going to become a money-for-service fee is just not acceptable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one party that does more than provide lip service to regional Australia. There is one party that, regardless of the rhetoric, refutes and rebuttals, remains committed to regional Australia. Despite the childish attempts by the opposition to distract our attention over issues of little importance to the people of regional Australia, we remain on track to deliver our promises. The National Party went to the 2016 election promising to prioritise stronger and more secure regional economies, because we know that a secure and sustainable regional Australia creates a strong and secure nation. We approach our commitments with common sense and we deliver on our commitments with common direction. I'd like to touch on some of these commitments that speak to the very core of what the National Party is doing for regional Australia and how this benefits my electorate of Capricornia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a big and fairly dry land yet has managed to create an agriculture export market that has fortified our balance of trade. It is the fastest growing industry and one that will strengthen our economy for generations to come. But we know agriculture can't happen without one essential ingredient: water. The $500 million National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, the most vigorous water infrastructure program in decades, will deliver once-in-a-generation opportunities for our regions. In just a few weeks, the Palaszczuk government will announce whether it will support the game-changing Rookwood Weir. We know that the business case stacks up and we know that it will deliver over 2,100 jobs. With $130 million already on the table, thanks to the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, it would defy logic that this project not proceed. I remain confident that the right decision will be made, but if it isn't then I'm sure my electorate will make the decision for the Palaszczuk government in the coming state election. But the regions cannot survive on agriculture alone. We need the value-adding industries that go with it, and we need diversity to shield the regional economy from the cyclical nature of mining, agriculture and tourism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building resilient communities and economies requires people. Australian people are notorious for being lured to the cities in pursuit of better paying jobs, advancing careers and better services. It's a chicken-and-egg scenario, and one the National Party is addressing by investing in communities to make them more appealing places to live. Already we have seen the $481.6 million Building Better Regions Fund support projects like the Yeppoon foreshore, the Rockhampton riverbank redevelopment and upgrades to the airport. Even as standalone projects, they are changing the landscape of city centres, but, more importantly, they are also inspiring a community to build a stronger future for themselves. As the additional $272.2 million Regional Growth Fund rolls out later this year, regions will be able to build on this landscape, think big and create a dynamic future. It is through this fund that projects like the Rockhampton CBD master plan will come to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By creating the right environment and focusing on the right industries, regions like Capricornia will have a fighting chance to build strong and diverse economies. But this can't be achieved without the right building blocks. The $600 million Northern Australia Roads Program has prioritised roads that will support economic development needs. Investment in infrastructure may not be sexy, but it's what makes the economy flow. We can't grow and export beef if we can't get the cattle to the airport or port. We can't get tourists to the Rockhampton riverbank or the Yeppoon foreshore if the roads are slow or flights are unavailable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Investing in infrastructure allows the movements of people, goods and services, and underpins its competitive ability to do so. Our commitment will deliver a strong and resilient future for regional Australia. Our programs and policies are more than just pre-election lip service. They are carefully considered to create the building blocks for a regional Australia that has a diverse and secure economy, improves liveability so regions can attract the right people, and builds the right infrastructure to bind the two together.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:34</span>):  Rather than drafting motions and reading speeches into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>in this place, the member for Capricornia would make better use of her time by standing up for her local constituents in and around Rockhampton. The many poor policy decisions of this government over four years—whether it be in health, education, the National Broadband Network or energy costs—all have had detrimental impacts on her local constituents, but we hear nothing about those. When the Department of Defence was trying to take land from her local farmers, she went completely missing in action. When Rockhampton residents were denied sufficient natural disaster relief funding following the cyclone, she was nowhere to be seen. In an unseemingly shocking attack that was trying to shift blame, Barnaby Joyce tried to blame the Queensland government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for the member for Capricornia, which she did not go to, is: does she support the south Rockhampton levee or does she not? If she supports it, will she fight for Commonwealth funding for that all-important project? Taking the fight up on behalf of her constituents is what the member for Capricornia position is designed to do. It's not designed to move motions here in this place that are simply designed to trick people into believing her and her government are doing something. Yes, most her points in her motion, if not all of them, are no more than a lick and a promise. The member for Capricornia, again, has had four years to deliver for her electorate. But in this environment where increasingly the parliament looks like <span style="font-style:italic;">House of Cards</span>, she now wants them to believe that suddenly she's going to do something. Well, I don't believe they believe her. These projects mentioned are all on the never-never.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Party's modus operandi is to (1) claim credit for projects initiated, built and funded by the former federal Labor government; and (2) promise loans on the existence of matching contributions. These loans, of course, are designed to fail. Barnaby Joyce likes to say, 'I have money on the table.' Fine, if people have matching funding to go with it. The National Party tries regularly to create the impression of action, but is doing nothing. They want state governments to fund or match projects before any of the economic or environmental assessments are made. This is not policy; this is just misleading local communities. It's a shocking way to run a government. All these stunts are designed, as I said, to demonstrate or to give the impression that they are doing something, but all they have is the next election in mind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm bemused by point 6 of the member for Capricornia's resolution, because I challenge her to demonstrate where these infrastructure projects that have been delivered are. Maybe her colleague might help her there, when he jumps to his feet next. The member for Capricornia couldn't even secure one of the Deputy Prime Minister's boondoggles or pork barrels—whichever term you would prefer. The APVMA is not going to Rockhampton—no, no. The Regional Investment Corporation is not being established in Rockhampton—no, no. Instead, they are going to New South Wales National Party seats, where the votes are needed more. They're going to New England and they're going to Calare, despite expressions of interest from locals in Rockhampton. I assume that representations were made by the member for Capricornia, although maybe she didn't make any representations at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's National Country Labor Forum will be going to Rockhampton in October. We will be consulting with local communities there about their real needs in Capricornia and we will be asking them about what they think about the member for Capricornia's performance over the course of the last four years. I suspect they will say, 'Well, she's talked a lot, she's promised a lot and she's says she's done a lot, but the reality is that she's done nothing for us.'</span>

He can do something today because he's meeting with sugar cane farmers who are representing my electorate and also the member for Capricornia's electorate. The backbone of regional Australia in our area are calling for one simple thing: for Labor senators not to dismantle the sugar code of conduct. The member for Herbert, who's here today, should be in on this too because QSL port workers' jobs are also at stake in this. They work in her electorate and live in her electorate. This is very important to regional Australia, and I would call on them to instruct their senators—</span>

In any cane-farming community, there is but one miller. It's a monopoly. We do not want the situation where milling companies, particularly foreign-owned multinational milling companies, skewer the market so that farmers just have to do what they're told.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a pleasure to speak on this motion about infrastructure in regional Australia, but I want to acknowledge what a strong advocate the member for Capricornia has been for her electorate. She's delivered some amazing things—things that we never saw while the Labor Party were taking that seat for granted. That's why she was elected. She was the first National Party person to be elected back to back in that seat in yonks, because they recognised the hard work. I think that's why there's so much fire and brimstone from the other side.</span>

The 75 per cent of funding that we've put on the table for the state government to take up for the Walkerston Bypass is going to help all of those constituents. There are two schools in Walkerston that desperately need those trucks off the main drag. The bypass is going to help, and that's being delivered by the member for Capricornia—a strong fighter. She's someone who actually delivered adequate and needed funding in the wake of Cyclone Marcia and assisted me in getting extra money out of the Commonwealth in the wake of Cyclone Debbie. She was the person who championed and actually got change for all of those residents in her electorate that were going to be affected by the Defence Force's purchase of land around Shoalwater. She has been a strong fighter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, we are going to see a lot of funding happen. We are already seeing it. We're seeing the construction of the Mackay Ring Road happening right now. That is creating jobs both in the short term with the construction of that road and in the long term by improving productivity. We have been the government that's delivered the Townsville Ring Road. We're going to move on, and we're going to fund the Haughton River Bridge—a bridge that needs to be replaced and made flood proof. We are contributing $412 million to the fixing of the Haughton River Bridge. These jobs are happening, and they're going to start very, very soon. In fact, we fast-tracked both of those projects when the state Labor government said that they couldn't be fast tracked. We fast-tracked them by putting the money on the table. They need to get on with Rookwood Weir as well. I've got to commend the member for Capricornia for this brilliant motion, because she is delivering in spades and this government's delivering in spades for regional Australia.</span>

The facts tell a different story. During the Howard years the regional development department was actually abolished by your mob, and $103 million of a regional roads program was diverted to city roads, including $2 million for that wonderful country road, Campbell Parade in Bondi. That's the great job you were doing for regional Australia. What's more, most people living in regional and rural Australia are on relatively low incomes. This government, as we know, is no friend to wage-earners, with cuts to penalty rates, and flat wages. That's what you're doing for people in regional Australia who are on wages: flat wages and cuts to penalty rates. Many people in regional communities require income assistance, such as the pension or a carers payment. These are the very people that the people opposite are demonising and targeting in their crackdowns. People living in regional and rural Australia require access to services, such as health and education, which those opposite want to privatise, casualise and move into their cities. That has the effect of diminishing social capital and making it harder for country people to volunteer or join their local footy or bowls club. The work experience kid for Maranoa, good on him, he's having a bit of a go, the chickenhawk who squawks! Often I'll hear him in the chamber interjecting, 'Government funding doesn't create jobs; private business creates jobs.' I have news for the member for Maranoa: if he really believes that, he'll give back the hundreds of millions that various governments over the years have given to infrastructure projects in his electorate and others across the country.</span>

                  </a>  Hand it all back, that's all government money, mate. At every turn the coalition fails regional Australians. Right now we're seeing before our very eyes the rollout of a substandard national broadband network which is delivering second-class broadband to regional Australia. There can be no better illustration of how the members opposite are failing regional Australians than what they have done to the National Broadband Network. Labor started the NBN in regional Australia with fibre to the premises. People forget this. Labor was making the point that country folk shouldn't have to expect second-rate broadband and shouldn't have to wait until the capital cities were done first. That's what Labor did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did they do? As soon as they got in, they reversed it. Labor rolled out fibre to the premises in Sorell and Midway Point in my electorate and in Smithton in the electorate of Braddon. It's not often that Sydney folk are told to wait at the back of the line, but we had a point to make—that people in regional Australia matter. That was forgotten by this mob. They came in in 2013, ripped it up, and said, 'Folk in regional Australia can get the second-class stuff.' They put more people on satellite, put more people on wireless towers and cut the fibre to the premises, so now people in regional Australia are stuck with second-rate broadband. They're going to be even further behind the capital cities. Capital cities get the gold standard, but people and businesses in regional Australia are not nearly as competitive anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to Tasmania, the idea that this parliament should note the commitment of this government to regional Australia just rings hollow. In the 2017 budget, which boasted of being a national infrastructure budget, there was not one extra dollar for new projects in Tasmania. Every dollar allocated to my state was for projects previously announced, many of them initiated by Labor governments. Tasmanians can guess where we figure in the Turnbull government's thinking, when the Treasurer failed to even mention Tasmania in his speech. So no, Member for Capricornia, who has left the chamber, no, Member for Maranoa, I do not commend this government for its supposed commitment to regional Australia, because it has demonstrated that, when it comes to regional Tasmanians, it has none.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the Community Development Grants, which under this government take pork-barrelling to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ninja Warrior</span> level: 130 to one—what a ratio! Poor old Ros Kelly got bloody—excuse my language—raked over the coals over sports rorts, wasn't it? You guys are in a whole new universe, the Ninja Warriors of pork-barrelling. This is government money for all Australians, and you're using it to shore up your seats in the most egregious, disgusting, disgraceful display of pork-barrelling this country has ever seen. You should hang your heads in shame.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  After that diatribe from the member for Lyons, let me give him a lesson on government responsibility: it is the government's responsibility to put environment and infrastructure around people to ensure they innovate and invest. This government has done that. We've put an environment around people in rural and regional Australia through trade agreements. The voodoo economics of those opposite is all about big government and they will spend their way out of things. But, do you know what? It's taxpayers' money—someone has to be creating wealth for governments to be able to spend. The trade agreements that we put in place for rural and regional Australians—because we represent rural and regional Australia—is putting real money into their pockets and allowing us to get the tax revenue to be the economic engine room of this nation. We have put real dollars into towns like Roma, Dalby, Longreach and Charleville because of those trade agreements we have put in place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also put in the infrastructure to support that, to give us the connectivity to get our product around the world and take advantage of those trade agreements. That's what a good government will do. The return on investment that we are making is being put into infrastructure, and that is delivering returns for this nation. That is what every government should do. Those opposite want to put big departments in Canberra. When the government talks about decentralisation, those opposite say they don't believe in it. What a crazy idea, to think we might have a government department located in the area of the people who actually want it and who the services are being delivered to. This is absolute insanity from those opposite. We are putting the infrastructure in. You only have to look at the $500 million that we are putting towards the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. We haven't heard from those opposite whether, in the unlikely event they're elected at the next election, they would commit to that. There is that whole investment in driving water. I have lived in rural and regional Australia all my life, and have worked in agricultural finance. I understand the power of a megalitre of water, not just for the farmer but for the communities—the small businesses, the bricks and mortar businesses in those communities that support communities and employ people. If you take away that investment in water infrastructure, you tear away the very social and economic fabric of those communities. Those opposite don't understand that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only in the last round of the Building Better Regions Fund just under $5 million was put into one project in my electorate of Maranoa, in Southern Downs, to build a cold storage facility that will put into Warwick 150 new direct jobs, 136 indirect jobs and 80 construction jobs. That will mean a more than a one per cent increase in the population of Warwick but, more importantly, it has flow-on effects because it means we might need more teachers, more dentists, more doctors, more fuel bowser people. We are going to ensure that we are investing smartly, pulling the economic levers that drive the growth in our regional and areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the little community of Morven, with fewer than 100 people, we are investing $4 million in a rail hub. It will ensure greater competition in the cattle industry and ensure we can get our product to the world quicker than we do now. Look at the Northern Australia Roads Program and the beef roads delivering for those in rural Australia, getting our product around the world. The people of this country are taking advantage of the environment we put around them. We are making sure that they can go and do a hard day's work and finally get the return that they deserve. It was our trade ministers who secured those agreements. With other roads funding, we have the $1.6 billion investment in the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. That will get our product to the world quicker, as will the $500 million investment in the Warrego Highway. This is about investment and understanding that if you put the environment and infrastructure around people in rural and regional Australia, we will be the ones that drive the economy. That is something we, on this side, are quite proud of. I'm proud of my good friend and colleague the member for Capricornia, who is a champion of her electorate and for regional and rural Australia, particularly Central Queensland. She understands that, if we put the right infrastructure and the right environment around those people in Central Queensland, then they will prosper—and that is why she continues to be re-elected as the member for Capricornia. I'm proud to say that she is one of my colleagues. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  I live in regional Queensland, and my electorate includes Palm Island, which is remote. We are all experiencing tough times. I represent regional and remote Queensland, and I know the challenges that we are facing, so there is no way on God's earth I can stand in this place and support a motion that purports to secure the economic future of regional, rural and remote Australia when it does not. The Turnbull government is not securing the future of regional Australia. The Turnbull government has not proved its commitment to regional, rural and remote Australia. The Turnbull government is not doing anything to act on issues directly impacting on those living in regional, rural and remote Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, I'll give you some facts about Townsville. Unemployment is just below 10 per cent; youth unemployment is around 25 per cent. There is growing unemployment in our ex-service personnel and veterans community and 55 per cent unemployment on Palm Island—one of the highest small-business insolvency rates in the nation. Traineeships and apprenticeships have severely declined with fewer enrolments in TAFE Queensland North this year than in previous years. There are level 3 water restrictions, and people are paying in excess of $34,000 a day to pump water from Burdekin Falls Dam. There are sky-rocketing electricity prices—the list goes on. So can someone from the Turnbull government please explain exactly how this government is securing Townsville's economic future? And please do not mention concessional loans or funds, which are doing nothing for Townsville.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility fund—or, as I like to call it, the no-actual-infrastructure fund—has not delivered one project. More has been spent on the board's wages than on funding projects. Can someone from the Turnbull government please enlighten the people of Townsville how this government has addressed the critical issues for our local economy that I have listed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government waxes lyrical about the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, but here's the kicker: this fund excludes the drought-declared regional city of Townsville. This fund prohibits Townsville from accessing any funding for water infrastructure and assistance with pumping costs. We are simply not eligible. How can drought-declared Townsville be excluded from the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund? What an absolute slap in the face to a struggling regional community on level 3 water restrictions. Again, I ask: can someone from the Turnbull government please explain to the people of Townsville how this assists our drought-declared community?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the Northern Australia Roads Program—talk about underdelivering and dragging your feet. This program was announced on 15 June, and 28 months after the program was first announced work is only now beginning on some of the projects. That's not to mention the Turnbull government's complete disregard for our Bruce Highway. The new official figures show that nearly halfway through the Turnbull government's 10-year upgrade program, it has invested only a quarter of the promised budget. Prior to coming into office in 2013, the government claimed that it would spend $6.7 billion on the Bruce Highway in the decade from 2013-14 onwards. However, the new figures show that four years into the program the government has only spent $1.7 billion. The Bruce Highway is Queensland's most critical road infrastructure and is central to the movement of freight and people up and down the coast. The Turnbull government might say that it's committed to upgrading the highway, however the figures show that their action does not match their rhetoric. The Turnbull government has completely underdelivered for regional, rural and remote Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is both the hare and the tortoise. They continually jump out quickly and make on-the-run policy announcements like the hare, and then, when it comes to actually delivering, they are slow like the tortoise or, if possible, even slower. On top of all of this, there is the Turnbull government's $17.3 million cut to fixing dangerous blackspots and local roads, $276.5 million cut to major roads upgrades, $20.2 million cut to upgrade roads the cattle industry relies upon, $50.7 cut to upgrade roads that connect communities and regional towns across Northern Queensland and $345 million to cut Queensland infrastructure spending—cut after cut after cut. So can someone from the Turnbull government please outline how any of this has helped Herbert? Can someone please highlight how this has addressed our unemployment rates, youth unemployment, energy costs, access to water security or jobs for our community?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  It is a great opportunity to rise this afternoon to talk to the member for Capricornia's motion in relation to her commitment from within her government towards regional Australia. I first mention the $500 million National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, which the Mid-Loddon pipeline in the Wedderburn region has been a huge recipient of. The $20 million contribution from the federal government, part of an $80 million project overall, will see over 270 farming businesses now supplied with clean, reliable water. Those farms have never had a clean reliable water supply and when the dams run dry the farmers have to cart water, which is a heartbreaking and expensive pursuit and one that certainly will be fixed and finalised forever once we have this pipeline linking the Grampians system with the Goulburn system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In clause 3 of the motion, the member mentioned the Building Better Regions Fund. Shepparton, in my electorate, has been a huge beneficiary of this fund, with $10 million from the federal government going towards the Shepparton Art Museum. There will be an overall build of around $35 million. This will be a world-class museum. It already houses one of Australia's best Indigenous painting exhibitions and has one of the best ceramic exhibitions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to delivering for regional Australia, my electorate has also been the beneficiary of a $97 million contribution for the Echuca-Moama Bridge, a bridge that has been talked about by various governments for nearly 50 years but was finally delivered by the National Party in government at state level—the National Party in government in New South Wales at state level—and the National Party in government at the federal level. All up, just under $300 million is being delivered to the Echuca-Moama communities to finally deliver them the bridge for which they have been waiting for all these years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The big one is a project that has been ongoing for many years now that has to do with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is an investment in water efficiency programs. Over $2 billion has been spent in the Murray electorate in relation to a plan that was firstly called the Connections Plan. It is now, under another model, called the Reset. The Victorian government has carriage over this, but using federal money as well as some of their own. This is a great example of where water equals wealth. When you give agriculturalists and farmers an opportunity to create wealth they will do that, provided you can give them water at an affordable and reliable rate. This is something that has become incredibly important. We all know that the Labor Party, under a Labor government, has made it very clear that they want to take more water out of active and productive agriculture to send it down the river in the form of more environmental flows. They want to do this for 450 gigalitres over and above the water that has already left the region. They want to send another 450 thousand million litres of water down the river, irrespective of the damage that exodus of water will have on the Murray River and Goulburn River communities. This is something that we need to make everybody aware of—that we have to have a fight over this water—because, as I said earlier, water equals wealth and when you give productive agriculturalists the opportunity to create wealth, they will do that. They will create something out of nothing because they have the ability to use the water at its optimum level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot talk about regional Australia development and investment unless you talk about the Inland Rail. It is nearly a $10 billion project that will connect up all of the producers from within Victoria, through New South Wales, and right through into Queensland. Again, this is going to add income into all of those farming businesses, because they are going to be able to increase the farm gate price they receive for their produce. This is an investment made right here and now, but the benefits will be able to be enjoyed by farming businesses for the next four or five generations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  I would like to repeat something the member for Murray just said: 'Water equals wealth.' He spoke about farmers. He said that if given the opportunity and given the right amounts of fresh, clean water for their produce then they would create wealth. That's not just true in regional Victoria and not just true in regional Australia; it's true in the Werribee irrigation district. I call on the member for Murray to support me in finding $11 million from the Commonwealth to support the growers in my electorate, who are getting $11 million from the state and who are left there as stakeholders to find two-thirds of the funding to improve, update and upgrade the irrigation system in the Werribee irrigation district. I have been talking about this since October 2015 and have been calling on this government and the minister, who obviously now can't be called upon because we're not sure what his legitimacy is at the moment. But I call on the member for Mallee and the member for Gippsland. The Werribee irrigators deserve Commonwealth support to ensure that they can continue to make a state and nationally significant contribution to leafy vegetables.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have now been talking about this for a long time. The member for Capricornia put forward a motion to celebrate the $500 million National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. In my electorate, we are waiting for our fair share of those funds. We are losing 40 per cent of the fresh river water that is going through channels, which are 50 years old and completely and utterly dilapidated. We want to fix that. The farmers who I work with every week are desperate to fix that. They want a futureproofed irrigation system, they want affordable water for their farms and they want to ensure an environmental flow for the Werribee River at the same time. If you think about a 40 per cent waste and about how water equals wealth, then in Werribee this government equals waste. That's because the government hasn't come to the party for the Commonwealth to support what is a nationally significant part of our agriculture industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go down there and visit those farms. I see the investment that they are putting into their businesses. They are building dams. The Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources likes to talk about building dams. Well, in my electorate the farmers are building the dams. There is no contribution from the Commonwealth. The farmers are investing in equipment. They are investing in transport and logistics systems. They are growing four crops a year. This is incredibly important work that the farmers are doing. They are doing work of national importance. I rise to speak on this motion today to highlight this, once again, and to call on members of the LNP. I call on Nationals members of the LNP and in particular the Victorian Nationals members of the LNP. I call on the member for Gippsland, who didn't hesitate to go down to celebrate the $20 million promised to Macalister. It is the Werribee irrigators' turn; they deserve better. It is all right for members of this government to stand in the House of Representatives and quote the Werribee irrigators in their speeches. It is all right for them to talk at the National Press Club about the national significance and the opportunities that the free trade agreement with China will create for these growers. But when it comes to putting their hand in their own pocket and putting $11 million on the table for the Werribee growers, they are nowhere to be seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appeal one more time in this place for this government to show some commitment to the growers in my electorate, who currently are working as hard as they have worked in the last 60 years and growing four vegetable crops a year using the best scientific method they can. All they want is a co-contribution from the Commonwealth to match the state's contribution of $11 million and their own contributions. They want a modern irrigation system that will futureproof their area from droughts. I would remind the House, as I have reminded the House many times, that this is a group of people who have embraced recycled water. In times of drought, they have gone to that place and embraced recycled water on their farms and proven that it can work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These growers deserve this investment in their future. The Werribee River deserves this investment to ensure environmental flows into the future and we deserve this investment locally to ensure we can maintain a million-dollar industry that employs thousands of people in my electorate of Lalor. I call on this government and those Nationals members that represent the state of Victoria to give us some support.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  This is another motion where the government can't even fill all of its spots. Here we are again. This is the second time this morning. This motion has been put forward by members of the National Party and the Liberal Party—the parties that claim to represent the bush; the parties that claim to be in the know when it comes to water—and they cannot fill their speaking spots. How hopeless is this government that it cannot even back in its own policies?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is probably because the person in charge of this portfolio and this area is none other than our favourite New Zealander, the Deputy Prime Minister. Let's just be honest about it and where we are at. Perhaps it could be because the fund is defined on the departmental website this way:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The National Water Infrastructure Development Fund (the fund) implements the Australian Government’s commitment to start the detailed planning necessary to build or augment existing water infrastructure …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It says 'detailed planning necessary' and I agree. In fact, many people would agree that any infrastructure needs to be well planned, well resourced and of benefit to the vast majority of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is not what we see happening in Rockhampton. There was no business case put forward. There was no detailed planning done before the government announced that they would fund Rookwood weir, just outside of Rockhampton—another pork-barrelling exercise by the government. I congratulate the Queensland government for saying: 'We like the project but we are going to do the work that the federal government failed to do. We are going to do the research and the business case to work out if and where the water is needed and work out if this weir is the best way to provide water to Rockhampton and Central Queensland.' I had the opportunity earlier this year to visit the site and to talk with locals, farmers and state government representatives. They said: 'Whilst it's a great idea, we don't have any customers yet. We're not quite sure yet who is going to buy the water if we build the weir.' This is the kind of detailed planning that a government should do before it commits millions and millions of dollars towards a project. The government have been out touting how brilliant they are, but this is $130 million towards a project where there is no business case. Rather than attacking the Queensland government, the Deputy Prime Minister and the member for Capricornia should be working with the state government to produce the evidence that this project is the best water infrastructure project for Rockhampton and the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another project the government tout is $20 million for the south-west Loddon pipeline in Victoria. That is a project which the Victorian government has been championing, saying to the federal government, 'You need to invest.' However, as is so classic with the government, they have excluded Newbridge from the consultations. Newbridge, which is part of the Loddon shire, is just outside of Bendigo. It is only a 20-minute drive from the heart of Bendigo and is at the base of this region. They don't have town water or sewerage. They have asked that they be considered in any redevelopment of the Loddon shire when it comes to water and pipelines. There is enough money in this plan to support all the communities of Loddon shire to get the water infrastructure that they need. It is not just about ensuring that the township of Newbridge has sewerage and town water. It is also about the towns of Bridgewater on Loddon, Tarnagulla and Laanecoorie and all of those communities within the Loddon shire having a secure water resource and access to water going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people in this place don't acknowledge that the City of Greater Bendigo, the Loddon shire, the Macedon Ranges and Mount Alexander are part of the Murray-Darling system. Our rivers feed into the Murray-Darling system, yet we have seen no commitment from this government to those rivers that feed into those shires or to those communities. We know from talking to people in those areas that there is a real worry about water and having infrastructure around water that will support their towns going forward. They are worried about contamination. In communities around central Victoria, such as Kyneton and Woodend, they are worried that the growth there is going to impact on the quality of the water in the Murray system. I urge the government to work with our state governments to get this right. Water infrastructure is critical. Stop the pork-barrelling and work with states to get it right.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  The pace of global disarmament has been dangerously slow. In recent weeks we've been reminded again of the risks of nuclear war, as tensions flare between two fractious and nuclear-armed leaders. But next Wednesday, at a United Nations ceremony, government leaders will begin signing on to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. This new treaty was negotiated and adopted by 122 countries in July and is a categorical rejection of nuclear weapons. It bans the production, stockpiling, testing, possession, hosting, use and threat of such weapons and is a major milestone on the path to a nuclear-weapon-free world. The treaty is founded on the understanding that any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic consequences to which no humanitarian or government agency could adequately respond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the Australian government boycotted the nuclear disarmament negotiations and was the only one of 115 countries that belong to nuclear-weapon-free zones to vote against the start of negotiations. Australia has signed the treaties banning chemical and biological weapons, anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions. If this government is serious about nuclear disarmament, it will sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Frankly, there is no legitimate role for these weapons, and we must relegate them to the past.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  In my short time as a member of the House, I've learned that it's incumbent on and important for us to be good listeners and to engage with our local community. We must connect on a regular basis with our constituents. We must walk the streets and talk to our small businesses. It's my willingness to maintain a grassroots approach to my role that led me to create several Fisher councils, which aim to give me snapshot views of the people in Fisher. During the last week of August I held separate meetings of the Fisher business, youth and seniors councils, which prompted robust and honest discussions about issues important to each of these sectors of our community. Our businesspeople told me they're keen to see ongoing investment in infrastructure, more security in employment and reforms in housing affordability. The youth council also had a housing focus, along with industrial relations and tax reforms. The seniors council reflected more on issues of the impact of the cost of living, health insurance premiums, superannuation and of course electricity and gas. The views shared at these meetings provide me with a very clear indication and a greater understanding of the struggles and daily challenges faced by people in our community. I'd like to thank all those members of the three councils for their work and for giving me their great feedback.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  When you have the largest electorate on Sydney's outskirts, and your community is active and engaged, you know that weekends are going to involve clocking up a few kilometres. I want to share some of the wonderful events that occurred one recent Saturday. It began with the biennial Kurrajong Public School fete, where the P&amp;C team, led by Vanessa Pilgrim, put together the biggest cake stall I've had the pleasure to indulge in for a while, a giant plant sale and a treasure trove of white elephant, plus plenty of fun for the kids. Principal Sean Montgomery, as MC, kept the energy high, and the community and generous local businesses made a big difference to this 300-student local public school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I next had the privilege of being part of the ceremony to award Andrew MacCormick, from the 1st Glossodia Scouts, his Queen's Scout Award. These awards are hard to achieve, and Andrew's award is testament to his long commitment as a scout and his leaders' and family's support. The Glossodia Scouts made it a memorable occasion, and I look forward to seeing where this impressive young man heads as he completes his HSC and takes on the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My final daytime stop was an hour and a half away at the top of the Blue Mountains, at Megalong Public School. This little school, which averages around 12 students, is nestled in one of the most picturesque valleys in the mountains. It's a central part of the community, and its 125th anniversary showed just that: past students and teachers, current families and local Aboriginal elders coming together to recognise public education.</span>

Maybe that's because it's hard to wrap your head around them. Maybe it's because they're difficult to legislate for. But I did want to stand up today and make comments regarding the reaction that a photo posted by the Prime Minister when he was at a footy match triggered last Saturday. He was watching the Swans play Essendon and, as he sat there, in his left arm, he cuddled his granddaughter Alice. As he kissed her on the forehead, as any loving grandfather would, a photo was taken. The Prime Minister also had, in his right hand, a beer. This prompted a reaction by some keyboard warriors. One said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Et cetera. There is such a thing as a slippery slope. When it comes to cultural and social issues, mainstream Australia needs to stand firm and, at times like this, call out an overreaction for going too far.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I suggest we don't pay much attention to comments on the internet. I was very sorry to get an email last week. I was sorry to get a lot of emails last week but particularly one that said the Monash mental health action group, which has been operating for some time in my electorate, has been disbanded. Unfortunately this group has given up, as all the federal funding for the new headspace centres has been allocated. The City of Monash, covering the Bruce, Chisholm and Hotham electorates, missed out. It's disappointing and frustrating for our community, especially for the young people who poured time and effort into advocating passionately for a dedicated mental health service, a headspace, over many years. I thank them for their efforts. I say to them: you ran a great campaign and I hope you learnt a lot. But, if anyone was wondering why young people get frustrated with politics, this is a great example. There is a clear need. There is a good case. Yet government MPs sat on the fence. The government MPs in our area would not back the community, and it is not hard to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were no straight answers, either. The group met with the minister's office, who made a few nice noises. But then we learnt through Senate estimates that the minister had been given a list of 20 sites across Australia. Ten were picked and our community—the electorates of Bruce, Chisholm and Hotham—missed out. What we want to know is: was Monash on the list of 20? If not, why not? I say to the young people: don't despair. Labor MPs will not forget. We will back the community every time. We'll work with the Monash council and Link Health to make sure that, be it this year or in the coming years, there will be dedicated mental health services for young people in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I rise to extend my best wishes to everyone celebrating the 150th anniversary of Glengallan Homestead, a significant piece of Southern Downs history. It was back in 1867 when pioneer John Deuchar laid the homestead foundations with his renowned Glengallan merino flock. The homestead was built by local tradesmen with local materials, including the exceptional sandstone sourced from the Swan Creek and Yangan areas. The uniqueness of the homestead presents a rare and treasured glimpse into our colonial history and the calibre of the people who lived in that time. The fact that the house stands today is a testament to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of Australia's colonial era pioneers and the immense hard work so tirelessly put into restoring the homestead in more recent years by the Glengallan Homestead Trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The homestead was unoccupied for nearly half of its lifetime and has been preserved with most of its original fixtures and fittings, including a mummified cat. Glengallan Homestead is now a major tourist attraction on the Southern Downs. I was very pleased to be able to attend the celebration of the 150th anniversary with many people who share in the history of Glengallan, including supporters, descendants of owner families and the broader community. Glengallan Homestead is a significant heritage tourism attraction and is yet another reason to visit the Southern Downs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  The Monmia Primary School in my electorate recently visited Parliament House. Unfortunately, it was a non-sitting week and I wasn't able to receive them. But I did take the opportunity to go and visit the school when they came back from Canberra. I want to thank the very dedicated team, led by Principal Lorraine Bell and year 5 teacher Tan Ly, who have a great bunch of kids. I was welcomed with a very robust and challenging debate. These are young grade 5 children who are very bright, and they probed me quite a bit about my role as a federal member of parliament. This very engaged group of young people asked me about the proposed changes at that time to the Australia Day holiday. I asked them in return what their view was and, needless to say, they weren't very happy about it. So I gave them a challenge. I said to them, 'If you do a survey in the school and come back to with me with a report, I will present it to parliament.' Of the 126 grade 5 students surveyed, 81.7 per cent said the date of Australia Day should stay; 72.2 per cent of the students celebrate Australia Day, with 69.8 per cent saying they spent the public holiday with their family; 7.9 per cent go to the beach; 4.8 per cent of the students enjoy a family barbecue; and a huge 75.4 per cent of the students felt Australia Day was very special to them, and they saw no need for it to change.</span>

Whilst I will continue to engage with constituents regarding this issue in the coming weeks and months, and people will certainly exercise their right to continue to campaign either way, I encourage as many as possible to participate in the current survey.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I am fortunate to represent a community in which local government is focused on creating urban centres that prioritise liveability, sustainability and transport-oriented and affordable housing. I have spoken before about the flourishing precinct at Cockburn Central. I also want to acknowledge the work that the town of East Fremantle has done to revamp its town centre, and I applaud East Freo council's effort to engage collaboratively, but firmly, with Defence on the sale and redevelopment of the Leeuwin Barracks site.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the City of Fremantle, there's been a huge effort since 2009 to bring economic and social revitalisation into the heart of the city while protecting its distinctive character. Two recent milestones show this balanced effort. At the end of May, the very substantial restoration of the Fremantle Town Hall was unveiled—a long-awaited and wonderful piece of work. This adds to an unprecedented level of heritage conservation investment since 2009, including some key projects that occurred with the support of the former Labor government. In that time, we've seen major restoration work to the Hilton Community Centre, the Princess May building, the Fremantle Markets, the old Fremantle Boys School, the Fremantle Arts Centre and the Bathers Bay precinct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other milestone marking the creation of new development in the CBD was the sod-turning for the Kings Square project. This transformational joint venture will bring 1,500 new government workers to the CBD and create street-level retail, entertainment and public realm improvements. I've no doubt it will be the catalyst of profound renewal in the heart of Fremantle.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  The recent decision by the Australian Rugby Union to axe the Western Force from the Super Rugby competition is a joke. The ARU has struggled to explain exactly why they cut the Western Force from the Super Rugby competition. The Force finished second in this year's Super Rugby competition, yet this success had no effect on the ARU's decision. The ARU said it was in their best financial interest to drop the Force, but $50 million from Andrew Forrest was turned down. Then the ARU said it was about player welfare and reducing travel time for players. But teams will still be travelling from the east coast to South Africa, Argentina and New Zealand. If the ARU was serious about player welfare, it would guarantee the futures of the Force players.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Reynolds' motion for a Senate inquiry will examine the ARU's decision-making processes and lack of transparency when removing the Force from Super Rugby. I look forward to the hearings, the committee's deliberations and getting a better understanding of how the ARU came to their short-sighted decision. I call on the ARU to show the people of Western Australia that they are committed to making Rugby Union a national game. Show us that you are committed to growing grassroots rugby in WA. Western Australians are passionate about their team, and we will continue to fight to ensure the future of the Western Force. The Western Force chants at the Wallabies game held last weekend are a very clear indication of WA's commitment to Rugby Union.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  I rise today to sing the praises of a particular group in my electorate—a sporting club that's called the Henley South Tennis Club. On 27 August, I attended their open day, which they have once a year. On this particular day, they get the whole community involved in the Henley Beach suburb, which is near the beach, obviously. It's a great way for the community to come together, have a hit and celebrate the upcoming tennis season, which is opening. All of us have tennis clubs in our electorate. I just love the way that this club gets so involved in the community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, their president, Liz Campbell, is very energetic and has been able to bring hundreds of kids together to learn the art of tennis, to play tennis and to go on enjoying the game of tennis later on in life. On the day, Angela Vaughan, our Labor candidate for the seat of Colton, and, of course, the councillor for the council, Jassmine Wood, were also there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think of this club and see what they're doing, they have been, for many, many years, getting kids in, giving them the ability to play a sport, bringing the community together and connecting families. I think it's really important to recognise that it's not only about the actual sporting achievements that they get but also about the fact that they are a community club with lots of functions that bring people together and ensure that the community gets involved.</span>

They have faced a lot of criticism over category D, but recent developments have brought out the truth behind the Queensland government's reckless game. On 1 August, I attended a meeting in Mackay with producers, industry leaders and reps from the state government. Again, the state government tried to pull the wool over everyone's eyes and put blame on the federal government. The facts were put on the table, and everyone quickly realised that the state government had sorely neglected our producers in pursuit of projects that were never eligible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 1,514 days local volunteers have been sitting 24 hours a day in a square in historic Windsor, an hour north-west of Sydney. They sit in pairs, four hours at a time, at this time of year sheltered from cold weather by a tarp and, through the night, a gas heater and blankets. In summer they take the sides of the tent down to let whatever breeze there is from the Hawkesbury River wash over them. They sit there because this is Australia's only surviving Georgian public town square, and it's under threat from a poorly-thought-through road project that would knock down an equally heritage bridge and put a modern concrete structure through this historic place. That's why the federal Minister for the Environment and Energy needs to show leadership and grant emergency heritage listing to Thompson Square precinct to protect this unique place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me take you through why this place matters, not just to me as the member for Macquarie, not just to my local community, but to all Australians. For a start, this square and its original listed Georgian buildings are still homes and businesses but are older than Port Arthur. The precinct dates to the same time as Sydney's Macquarie Street buildings like Hyde Park Barracks, The Mint and Sydney Hospital, which the New South Wales government is so concerned to protect. In 1810 Governor Lachlan Macquarie proclaimed Thompson Square as the first public place named to honour the contributions of an ex-convict. As we look back on Macquarie and his decisions, we know we're not proud of all of them. Like many governors he was determined to crush Aboriginal resistance, and that history needs to be told. At the same time, he was pivotal in the development of the Hawkesbury, a region which provided food for the early settlement in New South Wales. In January 1810 Macquarie wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am concerned to be under the painful necessity of stating to you that there is not at present a single ounce of Wheat or any other sort of Grain in His Majesty's Stores here for victualling the Troops and Convicts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The colony faced starvation. Within months Andrew Thompson was successful in appealing to settlers in the Hawkesbury to sell extra grain they might have been withholding from the government. Without Thompson's efforts, you'd have to wonder how the colony would have survived, and our nation's history might have been very different. What Macquarie did by rejecting the name of a king or a lord for this gathering place was send a strong message about Australia as a place of the fair go, a place where a convict would be given a second chance as a free man, having served his time, his name to be carried into the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state member for Hawkesbury, Dominic Perrottet, agrees with me about the significance of Macquarie's contribution. He recently said, 'Lachlan Macquarie was one of the chief architects of our state and our nation', yet his government, the New South Wales government, seems hell-bent on proceeding with the Windsor Bridge replacement project, which will result in a large, modern concrete structure right through the current historic square. It is shameful that the New South Wales government continues to ignore the advice of its own Office of Environment and Heritage, the Heritage Council of New South Wales and the National Trust. It also ignores the wishes of a community that desperately wants and needs improvements to its road and bridge network but respects the heritage contained in one of the five Macquarie towns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal Minister for the Environment and Energy has the power to protect Australian history and stories here. He can exercise his powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and grant emergency heritage listing to Thompson Square, and its precinct, to protect this unique place of Australia's cultural heritage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local group Community Action for Windsor Bridge, CAWB, which organises the 24-hour sit-in, has been doing so since 21 July 2013. They're doing it to fight the New South Wales government's plan and they must be commended for running what we believe is the longest heritage protest Australia has ever seen. The four years of effort shouldn't be ignored. In those years the local council changed its views on the square and now calls for it to be spared, only to be ignored by the New South Wales government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the community for its patience and resilience. We all know how appalling traffic problems are, and most of us realise the New South Wales government's plan is not the answer. I find it hard to reconcile that they will spend $100 million and in doing so not fix the traffic and destroy this important piece of history. This federal environment minister should be similarly appalled and act to make sure that Thompson Square is saved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  I second the motion. As my colleague the member for Macquarie has just outlined, Thompson Square is located in the heart of Windsor, the third-oldest place of British settlement on the Australian continent. It lies 55 kilometres north-west of Sydney and is a little over an hour away from the CBD by car or train. Thompson Square is Australia's first public square. It is the only town square that remains from the original five towns planned and designed by Governor Macquarie. Australia has a long-lived history that long pre-dates European settlement of this country, and capturing and maintaining its history—all elements of its history—is vital to our cultural identity as a nation. You may find it passing strange: what's the member for Lyons in Tasmania doing commenting on this in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales? I have a former history, having lived in Fremantle in Western Australia for many years. That, too, has a long, proud, built architectural history. I know just how important it is to retain what Tim Winton once referred to as a sense of place. Professor George Seddon made similar comments—that a sense of place is so vitally important, because if we don't have that sense of place, that sense of belonging to a past, it's difficult to contemplate where we head to in our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much built heritage in my own electorate of Lyons, a lot of it built by convicts, many of them Fenian political prisoners. Thompson Square, as the member for Macquarie alluded to, pre-dates Port Arthur, and Port Arthur has had a magnificent restoration. I can't imagine a Tasmania without Port Arthur and the incredible restoration work that has gone on there. Port Arthur hasn't been modernised, or, for want of a better word—and I hope this is not used as an expletive—bastardised. The heritage of Port Arthur has been respected. I think the least we can do is do the same with Thompson Square. We need to respect our heritage in all its forms. I will just come to this point: I'm a big believer in taking a fresh look at history through contemporary eyes. I don't think history is a fixed thing. </span>

                  </a>  No, it's not a fixed thing. The member for Dawson laughs at this. He thinks that somehow what he learned in primary school is all there is to history. But the fact is that history is contextual.</span>

                  </a>  It's all about facts. I do agree with the member for Dawson on that. History is about facts. But people are taught some facts and not others. What we need to do in the 21st century is look at history with a fresh filter. We need to look at Aboriginal history. What is the context of Aboriginal history in Australia? What is the context of Australia's history in terms of trade unions and their impact, and how things impact on trade unions? There are a whole range of things that we can learn from that. It's not just the white, colonial history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thompson Square is vitally important. It is only one element of Australia's history, but it's an element worth preserving. I'm not of the view that we should be tearing down statues or demolishing them. I think they are a part of our history, and we need to honour that history and learn from it. Sometimes we may need a new plaque on something to better explain part of that history. We owe it to our future to protect significant sites, like Thompson Square. And Thompson Square of course is remarkable in that Macquarie had the foresight to name it after an ordinary bloke. What better Australian story is there than to name a square after an ordinary bloke, right next to a street that is named after the King of England? It's a wonderful middle finger to the royalty of England and a great example of emerging Australian larrikinism. So, we owe it to our future to protect significant sites like Thompson Square, places where history was made, where people have gathered, and places that are important in our history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not a slavish devotee of colonial history. It is a very good thing that we are re-evaluating with fresh eyes what we have assumed to be our national history. It is a very good thing that we impose new filters on our history—through Indigenous eyes, through the experiences of women and of children who were brought out as little more than slave labour, through the experience of people who are LGBTIQ, or trade unionists, and of course through the experience of migrants. We need to learn from all these experiences and weave together a shared history of this land, a shared history of this nation that we all love, that we all want to see succeed. Thompson Square is part of that history, and what the New South Wales government is doing to it is a terrible shame and should be stopped.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November last year I called on the Australian government to abolish the 457 visa program in North Queensland. At that time the region was suffering from a severe downturn in the resources sector. Many highly skilled and experienced workers from the mining industry who found themselves out of work were noticing the high prevalence of foreign workers employed under the 457 visa program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 457 visa program was supposed to be where employers turned as a last resort when they couldn't find any Australians qualified and willing to do a job. But locals had lost what little confidence there was in the program. There was a clear view that Australian workers were being displaced in favour of foreign workers. I called for 457 visas to be scrapped in North Queensland because there was a very large pool of highly skilled workers desperately looking for jobs, and there were systemic flaws in that program that meant the program was failing the Australian people nationwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This time last year there were more than a million people holding temporary visas in Australia, and most of them held rights to work in Australia. Of those, 172,000 held 457 visas. To put this into context, there were only around 12 million people employed in the country. Now, North Queensland was not the only place where the program was being abused. So it was particularly good news, to me, when the Prime Minister announced back in April this year that the 457 visa program would be scrapped altogether, saying, 'Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs, so we're abolishing the 457 visa.' He went on to say, 'We will no longer allow 457 visas to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-National government has always recognised that businesses need certainty of labour. The best way to create jobs for Australians is to create an environment where people are willing to invest in new businesses and to grow those businesses. That has meant, in the past, looking for a flexible labour force that can plug the gaps. But any measures taken to create a ready and stable workforce should never come at the expense of jobs for Australians. The primary objective must be to get Australians into the workforce. That's got to be the priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In supporting the PM's announcement, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I say we'll work with … companies, but if they can't fill Australian jobs with Australian workers, we don't want the default position to be a foreign worker going into that position in the first instance. We want it … as the last alternative, the last option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my electorate in North Queensland took a more cynical view, believing that companies were turning to the 457 visa program as the first option. The Leader of the Opposition tried to play on that previous cynicism to criticise the solution, saying that scrapping the program altogether was only cosmetic. In fact, he went further, saying that the changes were a con job. It certainly isn't a con job for workers in my electorate who now have a better chance of getting a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The businesses who have complained about how hard it is now for them to hire a foreign worker don't think it's a cosmetic thing or a con job. For instance, Health Insurance Consultants Australia believe that the reset is such a game changer that they see an opportunity to include health insurance in salary packages to make them more attractive to the local workers. When talking about the visa changes, they said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it's clear that they will reduce the supply of skilled migrant workers and make it more difficult to replace skilled employees who are leaving Australia when their visas expire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is likely to increase competition for local skilled workers, meaning business will have to improve both their wages and benefit packages in order to compete in a changing labour market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Labor leader was honest with himself, he would admit that he didn't want any changes to have such a meaningful impact on a problem that he and his party created. That's because it was under the previous Labor government that the number of 457 visas blew out of all proportion and were being rorted as a back door to Australian residency. The number of 457 visas in North Queensland reached its peak under the previous Labor administration. It quickly declined after Labor was booted out of office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Senate estimates hearings in May of this year, the head of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, Mike Pezzullo, admitted that the 457 visa program had become 'bloated out and a proxy pathway to permanent residency'. That's because employers were not required to demonstrate that there was even a need for a worker of any kind, and they were not required to show that any temporary resident had necessary skills. The program was always open to abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, the Australian Population Research Institute released a report, authored by Professor Bob Birrell, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">The coalition's 457 visa reset: tougher than you think</span>. The report said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As is evident, the 457 visa is extremely generous to employers and open to abuse if employers want to use the carrot of permanent residence to tie the sponsored person to wages and conditions below those prevailing in the wider labour market. In addition, it makes a large number of jobs inaccessible to domestic job aspirants, at a time when there is increasing competition for employment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not surprising that the Labor leader doesn't want the reset to fix the problem, but fix it it does through a number of measures, including culling 216 jobs from the list of occupations eligible for the temporary skills shortage jobs, removing the ability of employers to offer a permanent residence carrot, introducing a labour market testing regime to prevent foreigners competing with locals for job, introducing higher fees and training levies on employers and adding tougher requirements for experience and credentials of potential applicants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of these measures will be far from cosmetic, and it has been far from cosmetic. To quote Professor Birrell's report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Make no mistake about the significance of the reset. When fully in place from March 2018, the flagship ENS program will fall to less than a third its recent size of 48,250. The number of TSS visas will also fall sharply relative to the current number of 457 visas being granted. Those who think that immigration levels are set in concrete will have to reassess this belief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reset leaves Labor exposed. It has been inert on immigration policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hardly surprising that Labor has been inert on immigration policy. Labor and the Greens opened the floodgates to 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals and some 800 boats and, at the same time, lost control of the foreign workers rorting the 457 visa system. This government stopped the boats and it stopped the 457 visa rorts. Meanwhile, half of those opposite want to get in government so they can undo it all and bring back the policies of Rudd and Gillard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the measures we are introducing to stop the abuse of programs to address short-term workforce shortages are about creating obstacles to employing a foreign worker. By making the process more onerous and more expensive, there is less incentive to try to rort the system. It's still possible for a business that is genuinely unable to find an Australian worker to secure an alternative, but it won't be easy and it won't be cheap. Those hurdles will not be not enough to discourage a business that is in genuine and desperate need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at this visa reset through the eyes of an employer wanting to access a temporary skills shortage visa, we see a number of obstacles and disincentives, including: the additional visa costs; the additional training levies; providing evidence of labour market testing—that costs a fair bit; monitoring of wage payments so employers can't short-change workers; and employers being named and shamed for noncompliance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For an employer seeking an employer-sponsored visa, there are just as many hurdles and disincentives, including: TSS visa holders in the two-year stream of occupations being no longer eligible for an ENS visa; employers having to demonstrate genuine need; higher standards of English required for those who are sponsored; the applicant has to be employed by the sponsor for three years, rather than two; and being named and shamed once again for noncompliance on wages. That's the sort of real response that Australian workers expect—a response that puts their interests first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party like to bleat on and on about 457s; I remember they did that back when they were in government. But they never did anything but talk about it. They were full of talk. They had lots of opportunities to fix that problem, but they never, ever did. They just let the problem get worse and worse. We have acted. The Liberal-National government's reset on the 457 visa program is, as I said, anything but cosmetic. It's actually a 'game changer'. Those aren't my words; those are the words of the Australian Population Research Institute. It is a game changer that will ensure Australian workers get first crack at Australian jobs. The game is changing. The winners are going to be Australian workers. It is this government's view and my firm view that Australian workers should get Australian jobs, that any Australian job should be open first and foremost to an Australian worker. Only where an Australian worker cannot fill that role should foreign workers be looked at. That is now the policy of this government. We have dealt with it, and we have delivered—unlike Labor, simply talking about it and doing nothing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  These changes go some way, and that's what the member for Dawson is putting forward in this motion. These changes prove just how much the Prime Minister is out of touch. When it comes to the government's changes on temporary skilled migration, it's a con of a crackdown, to be honest. We on this side are fighting for what really matters to Australia, and that's getting Australians to have the first crack at local jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April this year, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection rushed their announcement about changes to the skilled migration program, including 457 visas. This announcement was really a con job. Eighteen occupations were removed from the government's list of occupations which hadn't been used for 10 years. We know the government's really tough on deer farmers, detectives and antique dealers. The Turnbull government's made changes that would barely make a difference to anyone who is struggling to get a local job. In one report, a Department of Immigration and Border Protection official described the government's changes as a 'dog's breakfast'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion before the House seeks to move that the government's abolition of the 457 visa program is recognised as a game changer. Well, the apparent game changer from the immigration minister sent shock waves of uncertainty through business innovation, the education and medical sectors, and the economy. The government even failed to consult with the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, or MACSM, leading to Ged Kearney resigning from the Council, stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's replacement of the 457 visa system was not discussed with MACSM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a rushed announcement due to the lack of consultation. On 1 July this year, after they rushed this through, they had to reinstate jobs on their skilled occupations list, including biochemists, life scientists, microbiologists, music professionals and even horse trainers—all because they stuffed it up the first time. CEOs, chief information officers and university lecturers were all reinstated by the government to the government's medium- and long-term strategic skills list, following an outcry from the business and education sectors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need an Australian skills authority—an independent labour market testing authority—to determine genuine needs, genuine shortfalls, and with a proper one, not two, skills shortage occupation list. There needs to be consultation with industry, unions, higher education, TAFE sectors and state and local government so we can get our new SkillUP training fund instead of this dodgy fund those opposite created when they got rid of the national skills partnership and then shortfalled the states and territories. We know they have done that—and this is on top of the $2.5 billion they cut from skills and training, leaving 148,000 fewer apprentices in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nine days ago, Labor issued a press release expressing our concerns over reports in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> that employers were now using loopholes and other visa subclasses to bypass the Turnbull government's revised skills shortage list. Not only is this allowing employers to undercut local wages; it's allowing vulnerable overseas workers to be exploited by unscrupulous employers. This subclass 400 visa is the Temporary Work (Short Stay Specialist) visa. There has been an enormous increase in the number of these visas, going from about 6,000 a few years ago to 55,008 being issued in the 2015-16 financial year. According to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, it's designed for 'short-term, highly specialised, non-ongoing work' and the person must have 'specialist skills, knowledge or experience that is needed but cannot be found in Australia.' <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> reported instances of overseas workers being exploited and paid as little as $1.90 an hour. They also reported an adverse impact on the maritime industry, with a subclass 400 visa being used as a loophole. The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers described the loophole aptly in a recent letter to the immigration minister, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Some employers in the maritime industry have identified a gap in the system that is as wide as the Sydney Heads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the immigration minister removed ship's engineer, ship's master and ship's officer from the skilled occupation list in July, he conceded these jobs were not in a skills shortage and there are plenty of Australians able and willing to do that job. I recently met with officials from the Maritime Union of Australia, in both Launceston and Canberra, who stressed there were local workers who could fill these jobs. The minister is allowing employers to bypass their own rules. We guarantee that we will fix this issue—the government should not be undertaking these changes. The minister should act on this. They should not be undercutting local jobs, bypassing labour market testing and exploiting vulnerable workers. I commend the unions for what they are doing in the sector.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  I'm pleased to second the motion by the member for Dawson today. He's a member of parliament who understands the critical importance of putting Australians into jobs. When the Howard government established the 457 visa program in 1996, the Australian labour market was totally different. The visa system was complex and time consuming, and government policy was still focused on integrating Australia into a global economy. Times have changed greatly since the 1990s. We face new challenges with rising travel volumes and border security issues. The government are adjusting to these new economic and security conditions with our game-changing reforms to the visa system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 457 system was always intended as a last resort to fill temporary skills shortages when it was first introduced in 1996. It succeeded a system that granted approximately 13,000 visas per year. By 2013, well over 100,000 457 visas were issued per year, by far the largest scheme of its kind in the developed world. It grew exponentially in the six years of the Labor government. They were more happy to let jobs go to foreigners when locals at home were perfectly capable of doing the jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013, employment minister Bill Shorten and immigration minister Chris Bowen issued a record 110,000 457 visas to foreign workers. Among other things, this led to fast-food outlets flying in foreign workers to fill jobs rather than employing young Australians in need of a job. Julia Gillard even imported a Scottish spin doctor into her office on a 457 visa. Under Labor, the 457 system went from being a good initiative in the Howard government to a backdoor pathway to residency. From 2010, half of the 457s eventually obtained permanent residence visas. This was criticised by businesses, trade unions and the like, but Bill Shorten didn't have the courage to do anything about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government has acted on this mess created by Labor, implementing a series of new measures to ensure that Australian workers always come first. When the Prime Minister announced earlier this year that the government would scrap the 457 program, the Labor Party and the media were cynical. But it's clear from the latest figures that the result has turned the tide back in favour of Australian workers. The latest migration statistics reveal that employer-sponsored numbers have now halved since the record years under Labor—down to 48,000, the lowest level since the 1990s. Over time the government's actions are projected to reduce skilled migration numbers by more than 50,000—a quarter of the total program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's plan to protect Australian jobs is underway. In April it halted the eligibility for foreign work visas in a number of job categories, which Labor had granted 21,000 visas to over six years. In July it introduced much tougher English language standard requirements for all permanent entry sponsorship visas. By March 2018 the 457 will be gone and replaced with a new temporary skills shortage visa. Most significantly, the TSS visa application will require labour market testing. Unemployment has long been the scourge of Wide Bay. If a business in Wide Bay is looking for workers, I want Australians who are out of work or have been made redundant to be given the first chance at a job, not foreign workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is being recognised for this bold new approach to protect Australian jobs. In August an independent review by Bob Birrell of the Australian Population Research Institute came out, supporting the government for these measures. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The reset puts an axe to the … policy of encouraging employers to recruit as many skilled temporary foreign workers as they want and then facilitating their transition to permanent residence …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reforms to the visa system are long overdue. Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen should've acted when the numbers got out of control, but they failed to and they let down Australian workers. I commend the government for pursuing this positive new change. I will continue to work hard to provide jobs for Australian workers before foreign workers every time.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  This is a ridiculous motion. We're standing here supposed to celebrate the minister's fake crackdown on rorts in the temporary skilled migration scheme. The abolition of the 457 visa is politically motivated and won't work. It's a bandaid. It's replacing one visa with two others and fiddling the occupation list to remove a few that are hardly ever used. The fundamental point is: nothing will change without proper labour market testing. Labor supports proper labour market testing for skilled visas. The government does not. Nothing the government does will make any difference until it accepts its failure and introduces proper labour market testing for temporary skilled visas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rorts have not stopped with the minister's fake crackdown, as the shadow minister said. The same problems are just moving to other visas. Last week, Fairfax reported shocking cases of rorts with the 400 visas. Chinese labourers were paid $1.90 an hour and Filipino metalworkers were paid $4.90 an hour, wreaking devastation on what little is left of the Australian shipping industry. We've got clear evidence of positions that used to be filled by 457 workers now being filled by even more exploitable ultra-short-term workers on 400 visas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The short stay specialist 400 visa is supposed to be for highly specialised workers, where their skills are not available in Australia. The government is very secretive about this visa. Since being elected, the number of 400 visas each year has exploded from 6,200 in 2012-13 to over 55,000 last year, and the experts are predicting even more this year. You may well ask: What for? What kinds of jobs? What kind of work? Well, no-one really knows. More than half are not specified or are in the 'other services' category. Experts say that for bad employers this lack of transparency makes this visa even easier to rort than the 457 visa. The problem is not migration per se. It's not migrants. There's nothing wrong with wanting to stay in the country. It's when businesses rort and misuse the program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had numerous reports of 400 visas being issued by the department in 24 hours. How on earth could they be confident if that's the level of scrutiny given? It appears, from my research, the department are breaching their own <span style="font-style:italic;">Procedures Advice Manual</span>, which says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Delegates need to be cautious about attempts to engage overseas workers which may have more to do with reducing costs by circumventing local salaries ... than genuine non-availability of workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They figure that out in 24 hours, apparently. A senior departmental officer has admitted there is no labour market testing. They just believe what the applicant says and issue the visas like lollies. If the minister wants the department to change their approach, he could instruct them to do so today—but he has not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More people have approached me. There are more shocking cases in the shipping industry—like Greg, a highly skilled engineer from Western Australia. He has been out of work for 16 months. He'll lose the roof over his head in the next couple of months and he has given up. Greg's wife is Ukrainian and right now they are in war-torn Ukraine, with their four-year-old son, looking for an apartment to try to get skilled work. Meanwhile, the minister has issued 31 400-class visas for officers on the vessel POSH<span style="font-style:italic;"> Arcadia</span> to work in Western Australia from August to December 2017, including one for a worker from the Ukraine. This is work that Greg and others could do. Greg goes to the Ukraine, and Ukrainians get visas to work here in work that he could do. On Saturday, I spoke to Michael from Victoria. He applied for this work. He's an experienced chief engineer. He's ready to work in Western Australia or anywhere, but the minister issues 400-class visas instead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also clear these rorts are extending beyond the shipping industry. I have heard of concerns already in building and electrical industries and of IT companies rotating cheap labour through on three- to six-month job lots. There are lower wages and it's also lowering our tax take, because they're not here for long enough to pay much tax. The minister's response to all of this was in the paper last weekend. He said that the mess was all Labor's fault because they introduced the visa in 2012. He put aside the very unfortunate fact that the Liberals had been in government for four years; they presided over an explosion. He doesn't mention that it was the Liberal government that quietly doubled the length of time of this visa, the 400 visa, from three months to six months in late 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's other line is: 'Don't worry. I'm doing a review of lots of visas, so I will fix everything at some point, sometime later on.' Well, kicking the can down the road is not good enough. The minister must deal with this now—pronto, today. I say to him: tell your department to stop issuing the visas like lollies. You could fix this. Call them now. The minister may not be able to get through on the phones, of course, because he has cut so many staff that they're not very good at answering the phones. He's probably got them too busy issuing the dodgy visas. He'd have to write them a letter! The minister must act quickly or more Aussie workers like Greg, like Michael and like Gary will be sent to the scrap heap and have to wait for a Labor government to fix this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr McVEIGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  This afternoon I applaud the necessary reforms to the temporary work visa program that began in April of this year. This is part of the government's overall national economic plan to drive growth and create more and better paid jobs. It's a plan that is getting results, as our economy grew 0.8 per cent in the June quarter. On a yearly average basis, our economy expanded by 1.9 per cent last financial year. That's above our budget forecast and equal with the United Kingdom, the United States and the rest of Europe. The recent national accounts data followed weeks and months of evidence of more jobs, more investment, more wages and more exports. As the Treasurer said in handing down our budget in May of this year, there are better days ahead. This is because there has been a recovery in economic conditions that will drive growth into the future. In regional Australia and in electorates like my own electorate of Groom, there has been and continues to be very significant growth. Australia's agricultural exports are up 18.7 per cent through the year to the June quarter. Chickpeas in particular are doing extremely well in the export market out of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even as the government makes its sensible reforms to the temporary work visa program, it has recognised the need for some industries in the rural sector to have access to temporary workers in times of harvest. The Turnbull government has announced a number of new measures to further support employers and seasonal workers to access the seasonable worker program. Critical safeguards have been built into this program. They include the requirement for employers to fully test the local job market before they can apply to recruit workers. These safeguards are evidence of the tempered manner this government is taking to redress the balance between employer interests and those of domestic workers. The government, on one hand, tightens the rules and regulations that have allowed a pathway to permanent residency in Australia but, on the other, allows industries with genuine need to access skilled workers. This is good policy at work. This is about balance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The balance that I refer to also includes the responsibility that exists, I believe, for Australians to step up to those job opportunities, because the abolition of the temporary work skilled visa subclass 457 is all about ensuring more jobs for Australian workers. Pat Gleeson, a good friend of mine and general manager of Oakey Beef Exports in the Darling Downs—as well as having responsibility for other meatworks, including that in the member for Dawson's electorate—often expresses concern to me about young Australians not being aware of or not being willing to take up positions in such establishments. These are well-paid jobs, and they were good enough for Pat Gleeson when he started in the meat-processing industry all those years ago. And they were good enough for me, because that's where I started my career as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to put Australians first in the job market. We are continuing to refine our policy settings to encourage more people into meaningful work. We are ensuring more jobs are available for Australian workers, and that's what these measures are all about. We are encouraging more and more of our young people to look at futures in, for example, the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We are doing this because we are a government that supports work for Australians, jobs for Australians and, of course, a future for Australians. Foreign workers can add value to our nation, but they must supplement, not replace, hardworking Australians, and there must be opportunities for hardworking Australians into the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I rise to speak on this private member's motion for the abolition of temporary work skilled 457 visas, moved by the member for Dawson. Now, it does go some way, but nowhere near what's required. I will give you an example. We currently have approximately 800,000 overseas workers on temporary visas of some sort, while at the same time we have 700,000 unemployed in this country. When you look at those figures, you can see why this needs to be fixed, and it needs to be fixed now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from previous speakers that there was absolutely no labour market testing when this was being worked out—none. You certainly need labour market testing to be able to analyse and work out what's required, and, where there are shortages, to fill those shortages—if there are shortages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have raised this issue many times in this place, including when I was here in 2012 and 2013. I have made many speeches on this topic, and I think rightly so. Voters in my electorate come and see me with their unemployed children who have degrees and special skills certificates yet cannot get a job. They give me examples of places where they have done a little bit of casual work and where overseas workers with temporary visas are filling those positions. There's nothing wrong with filling positions when there is a skills shortage or a shortage in a particular area, but I think we need to look at the way that these visas are handed out. There is absolutely nothing wrong with us, in this place, doing everything we possibly can to ensure we have rules and regulations and legislation that says: when there is a vacant position, Australian workers should be given the opportunity to apply and gain employment in those areas. There is nothing wrong with ensuring that the onus is on the employer to prove that they couldn't find local workers to work in a particular job or skilled area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 1996, one of the first things the Howard government did was dismantle the visa system and the entire way we looked at immigration. Previously there were forms of 457 visas, but employers had to show they had advertised locally and nationally, and only then were they allowed to apply to bring someone in from overseas. They also had to explain why the people who had applied for those jobs were not up to scratch for those positions. I think it is far too easy to dish out these visas. And, even more importantly, I've seen cases—for example, in South Australia—where people were brought over as top-quality chefs only to be doing dishes. They were not paid for months on end and were sleeping on the kitchen floor of the restaurant. There are documented cases where this has been taking place. This is what this does: it opens up a whole range of dangers for people who are brought over by an employer and then have that whip held over their heads—the possible restriction or removal of their visa. This is very, very dangerous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding shortages in particular areas, in the fifties we did it very well. There were shortages in lots of areas. We brought migrants over and made them full-time Australians, basically, with permanent visas. They went on to fill those positions and help grow the economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, basically, has just done some window-dressing on this. There is nothing but window-dressing. This resembles the Christmas window-dressing some of the department stores do; that is how much of a non-change this was. We heard last week in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> that there are employers who have been circumventing the visas and getting through absolutely massive loopholes. The government hasn't abolished the 457s; it's merely changed the name—it's merely given different names and made cosmetic changes. When 18 occupations that have been removed from the government's list of occupations have not ever been used, how is this not window-dressing? Following the government's rushed skilled migration announcement in April, they were besieged by businesses and industry—especially the education sector—saying that they weren't consulted. If you really want to fill the shortages, you have to look at the long term. In this space, we're not training people to fill those shortages. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  I rise this afternoon to oppose the member for Dawson's motion, because, quite frankly, it's flawed and erroneous. Although I agree that the 457 visa program has become, as the motion states, bloated and a proxy pathway to permanent residence under this government, I cannot agree with the rest of the motion. I'm not going to stand here and commend the government for removing just a small number of occupations from a skilled worker visa. I'm not going to commend the government for removing a picture framer from a list of skilled workers. I will concede that I'm not entirely aware of how many picture framers there are currently in Australia, nor do I know what the demand is for new workers in this field, but what I do know is that removing picture framers from the skilled worker visa is not going to end the employment crisis, which this government has done so little to solve. This government has revealed a list of occupations least employed as 457 visas, and has axed them. The less that an occupation has relied on a 457 visa, the less of an effect removing them from the list will have. When 18 of the occupations that were removed haven't been used in the past 10 years, removing them effectively does nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from cutting a few occupations from the 457 visa that were rarely, if ever, used, this government's refresh of the skilled workers visa is truly just window dressing. The member for Dawson may deny this all he likes, but it is so true. While he tries to call this a game changer, really all this is is a name changer. There are no meaningful changes that will ensure the local jobs go to local workers. Employers will still be able to turn to a temporary work visa to undercut local jobs, wages and conditions, like they have been for so long under this Turnbull government. The member for Dawson claims that this will redress the balance between employer interests and those of domestic workers, but, as all Australians know, the LNP's definition of balance tends to lean pretty heavily to one side—besides which, I'd like to know just how the government knows what the interests of stakeholders are. Following April's rushed announcement, the Turnbull government was besieged by business, industry and the education sector for failing to consult with them, but it's not surprising; it's typical Turnbull government practice. They seem to think they know best, and that they know what everyone else wants. Member for Dawson, you can't just assume that you know what the interests of employers and domestic workers are; you have to speak to them, to listen, to hear what they say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you that Labor has spoken with key stakeholders. We've listened and we've heard. That's why a Shorten Labor government will crack down on 457 rorts and build a skilled Australian workforce. This will reduce our reliance on using overseas workers to fill shortages. Rather than just renaming that 457 visa scheme, Labor will take meaningful steps to make it less necessary for us to rely upon 457 visa holders, and to ensure that it's not a regular and normal employment practice in this country. I think the important part, too, is we recognise that people all over Australia are actually looking for work, and people are doing it tough while they're looking for work—people like those in my electorate of Longman or further north in the Central Queensland area of Rockhampton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also recognised that there are skills shortages in certain industries, and we've made a connection. Labor will help local people get the skills they need to get into work. While the Turnbull government has made huge cuts to skills and training—$2.5 billion, in fact—Labor will establish the SkillUP Training Fund to reverse the damage this government has done to the sector. Education and training is a long-term investment in our country's future, and this government's lack of foresight is absolutely disgraceful. Labor will also establish the Australian Skills Authority, an independent, labour market testing body that will determine genuine skill needs and restrict work visas to only those areas, and we will disallow any labour loopholes in trade deals like the deals with China, Japan and South Korea which the government allowed to waive local labour market testing. While this government wastes Australia's time, Labor's already thinking ahead, and when Labor wins the next election, Labor will reverse the damage that this government has caused and will set Australia up for the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to support an innovative LEGO project designed by my constituent, Damien MacRae, and his son, Aiden. In 2016, without warning and still in his early 40s, Damien was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. This turned Damien's and his family's world upside down. Despite the tremendous weight put upon his shoulders, Damien set his mind to making a difference. This has given rise to a project built on hope and courage. I was fortunate to meet Damien this year and hear his story firsthand. Following his diagnosis, Damien and Aiden set themselves a mission: to devise a LEGO set which promotes sun safety to children. Damien, through his own personal trials, began to design a sun-safe LEGO set with his son Aiden entitled 'LEGO Surf Rescue'. They drew inspiration from their own experiences of Australia's beaches to design the LEGO set, as well as spending hours online together finding elements they wanted to include in the project. Their goal was for this LEGO set to feature sun-smart Australian heroes wearing hats, sunglasses and sunscreen. Together they designed a LEGO set featuring an Australian beach with waves, surfboards and a sand castle, complete with surf lifesavers and a shark. The concept is iconically Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They submitted the project to the LEGO Ideas program. This program reviews LEGO set ideas that are supported by 10,000 members of the public, with approved designs becoming official products. Their project started small in the later months of 2016. By October, they passed their first milestone—100 people online had seen their project and supported it. Just over five weeks later, their support had grown tenfold to over 1,000 supporters. The support from LEGO fans across the globe continued to grow as more people learned about Damien and Aiden's story and joined in supporting their mission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 April this year, Damien and Aiden received the message they had been waiting for from LEGO—'Congratulations on 10,000 supporters'. They had reached the benchmark for official review, and the project that started in their own home is now being reviewed by LEGO engineers. In acknowledging this project, LEGO sent Damien the following message:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The entire Lego Ideas team is honoured you and Aiden have chosen to express your important message about surf and sun safety through Lego bricks …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our warmest thoughts go out to you, your family, and friends. You and your son’s tribute and message have reached tens of thousands worldwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Damien and Aiden should be very proud of their achievements. Even whilst the project is still in review, they have touched thousands of people across the globe with their message about sun safety. If this project is approved by LEGO, it will be the first LEGO set in history to feature figurines wearing sunscreen. LEGO is world renowned for its quality toys and its emphasis on learning through play. It is no surprise that Damien and Aiden chose LEGO as the foundation for their idea. I'm reliably told that Aiden loves it. 'LEGO Surf Rescue' provides a new avenue for parents to engage with kids about the importance of beach and sun safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia we are blessed with some of the best weather, but unfortunately Australia also has the highest incidence of melanoma in the world. Melanoma is the most common cancer in young Australians aged 15 to 39. Even today, when the facts about melanoma are widespread and well known, too many people are still being diagnosed. Australians spend a lot of time in the sun, from playing sports to going to weekend barbecues and, of course, the beach. Wherever we can, we must spread the important message about sun safety and reduce the tragically high incidence of melanoma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Damien's resilience and his message are inspiring. The comments online from supporters worldwide are a testament to that. The LEGO philosophy is grounded in the knowledge that creativity and inspiration are grown through good, quality play. Without a doubt, this project embodies the creative mission of LEGO, and 'LEGO Surf Rescue' would stand proudly alongside other LEGO products in stores around the world. I would like to thank Damien and his family, who are watching along at home, for allowing me to share their story with the parliament. Damien and Aiden set out to make a difference, and it's clear beyond doubt that they are achieving precisely that. Aiden, you should be very proud of yourself and this wonderful project, and I'm sure you're very proud of your dad. Damien's resilience and optimism truly inspire, and this story rightly deserves its place in the people's house here in Canberra. I will also be writing to LEGO's headquarters in Denmark expressing the Australian parliament's support for this project and encouraging them to approve 'LEGO Surf Rescue' to become an official LEGO product. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  I second the motion and, in doing so, I congratulate and thank the member for Greenway for bringing this inspirational story to the parliament but also, importantly, through this motion highlighting the incidence of melanoma in our community and the great work and research that's being done to combat it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Greenway pointed out, Australia and New Zealand have the largest incidence of melanoma in the world. Twelve thousand people are diagnosed in our country each year. It's the third most common cancer amongst Australians. For a nation that lives by the water and spends a lot of time in the sun—and we're about to enter the warmer months in this part of the world again—it's very important that we're raising awareness on the importance of being safe when you go out in the sun. I can recall as a kid in the late 1970s and early 1980s going to the beach and spending the whole day in the sun with no sun protection at all and very little sunscreen. You were lucky if you wore a hat. Thankfully, we now know that that is dangerous. Health experts and governments have worked together on campaigns such as Slip-Slop-Slap to raise awareness, and it's working. When we go to the beach now, particularly with our children, we cover them up with sunscreen, hats, rash vests and the like to ensure that they're protected. But we also make sure that we're doing more in terms of research to combat what is a terrible, terrible disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to pay tribute to Damien MacRae and his son, Aiden. Unfortunately Damien has been diagnosed with stage IV melanoma. But he hasn't sat on his heels and done nothing about it. He's gone out into the community and worked with Aiden to raise awareness, and what a fine job they've done. We all know that children love LEGO. They love playing with LEGO, and it's a very effective way to get a message across for young children. I have kids in the same age bracket as Aiden, and they love their LEGO and can spend literally hours—days on end—playing with LEGO and building things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they were first interested in LEGO, Damien discovered that despite their efforts to try to find a beach theme, a beach setting, they couldn't find one. LEGO simply didn't make it. They set about working on having this developed into a particular LEGO product that could be sold throughout the world. To do that you need 10,000 supporters, and that's exactly what they did: they set about getting those 10,000 supporters, and they did. The prototype for their LEGO set has already been developed, and you can see it there. They've done an excellent job. It include a set of surf heroes—surf lifesavers—being sun safe, wearing hats, covering up and putting on sunscreen. It includes a patrol tower; sunscreen, of course; the iconic surf reel, surf skis; the red and yellow flags; and an inflatable rescue boat. Some of the surf team include Bob, named in honour of Bob Marley, who unfortunately passed away from melanoma at the age of 36; Keats, who's named in honour of Diane Keaton, who's been a longtime campaigner for melanoma research; Hugh, in honour of Hugh Jackman, who himself has fought melanoma; and Nic, in honour Nicole Kidman, who's also a very solid campaigner for Slip-Slop-Slap and melanoma research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've got the 10,000 votes. The proposal is now being considered by LEGO. Damien tells of being blown away by the fact that he received a message from Kirk Christiansen, the head of the LEGO dynasty, who was so overwhelmed by the application Damien and Aiden put in. It's now being revised, and we're hoping that this wonderful project gets up. It would be the first time ever, as the member for Greenway said, that LEGO figures are being sun smart and wearing sunscreen! What a very effective way of teaching that message to young kids, not only in Australia but throughout the world. They've also indicated that if their project is successful then some of the funds—a percentage, I understand—from sales will go to the originators of the idea. Some of the funds that they get from this proposal will go into melanoma research and sun safety in Australia. Congratulations to Damien and Aiden MacRae on this wonderful proposal, and thank you for the work you're doing in supporting Slip-Slop-Slap and sun safety and melanoma research in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I wasn't going to speak on this motion regarding the melanoma and LEGO surf rescue project, but congratulations to the member for Greenway and a thankyou to the member for Kingsford Smith for drawing this to our attention. What a fantastic, amazing story. I hate melanoma, for good reason. These scars on my face don't come naturally. And I love LEGO. I hate melanoma; I love LEGO. This is one of the best stories. You should be getting a double-page spread in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Herald Sun</span> on this issue on what Damien and Aiden MacRae have done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the biggest thing in one of our households at the moment is PAW Patrol. Everything happens around PAW Patrol. Now, we're just moving into that place of LEGO. I'm told the LEGO I have in my household, which we've had for more than 40 years, is now retro, which I was very disappointed about—it happened very quickly. My twin boys are nearly 40 and we still have the LEGO, we still have the train sets and we still have all the bits and pieces that go with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This innovation is probably one of the best stories I've heard in all the times since 1990 I've been in and out of this parliament. It's just a fantastic story. No-one can get the message. I still like being out in the sun without a hat on. I don't like hats. I'm of a generation that didn't like hats, yet my father was of the generation where they didn't go anywhere without a hat. The whole generation wore hats. They wore hats to the races. I went to the races with a hat on. It was a hot, sunny day and I was glad I had the hat. The photo went in the local paper and they said, 'Lose the hat. You look like a goose.' I thought it looked pretty good, actually. The trouble is that the message is not there. This is one of the most treasured ways I've ever heard. Congratulations Damien and Aiden MacRae and all who have been part of this project. What an amazing project. I hope you get really good coverage from this. I'd like to think I could support you in some way. But what a fantastic story. With a lot of the things we do in this place, you often wonder what your grandkids will say in 15 or 20 years' time and they ask, 'Pop, you were in parliament then. What did you say about the issue? What did you do about the issue?' For both members, the member for Greenway and the member for Kingsford Smith, it is a great story you are telling. I wish every story told in this parliament was like the one you've told today. I congratulate you both.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me great pleasure to move this motion as I'm a strong supporter of the government's $200 billion investment in defence, and the impact it will have on small- to medium-sized businesses across Australia. It's without doubt an exciting time to be involved with the defence industry in Australia. The government is investing record amounts of money into defence procurement in Australia and I'm working hard to position my own electorate of Fisher to take advantage of what is on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The release of the defence white paper, the Integrated Investment Program and the Defence Industry Policy Statement last year marks a significant milestone in Australia's strategic policy approach. It identified that our defence industry is a core element of our defence strategy and capability, and it established a long-term plan to grow and support Australian industry to deliver defence capability. A significant investment is being made into the renewal of ADF capability. The Integrated Investment Program has outlined a $200 billion investment over the next ten years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building on this is the Defence Industry Policy Statement, which has been developed to maximise businesses in Australia that can get involved in the delivery of defence capability and sustain it long into the future. One such business in my own electorate of Fisher is Praesidium Global. This Caloundra based company designs and manufactures multipurpose unmanned ground vehicles that can assist soldiers on patrol with hauling heavy loads such as weapons, ammunition, packs and the like. They can also be used as armed assault vehicles and for casualty extraction in hazardous environments. Defence engagement with Praesidium Global came about following their attendance at the Army Innovation Day in Canberra nearly a year ago. The innovation day is held with the purpose of encouraging Australian companies to present novel capability options that could be attractive to Army's future development. Praesidium Global was eventually selected to conduct a trial with Defence at a value of $1.3 million. This exciting opportunity has put Praesidium Global on the defence map and has generated strong interest from many other multinational companies. Praesidium Global are now displaying their unmanned ground vehicle in London at an international military hardware exhibition, as I speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also commend the government on establishing the Centre for Defence Industry Capability, the CDIC, and Defence Innovation Hub. The CDIC recently presented at my inaugural Fisher defence forum and are working with me on another event next month. The CDIC has received $230 million to financial year 2025-26 so that it can develop and deliver tangible results for defence through greater industry engagement and the facilitation of innovation through the Defence Innovation Hub. It will be key in upskilling industry's global competitiveness and export readiness. It is specifically this focus on export readiness that excites me, as I see great potential for Australia to maximise its reach in this area. Australia ranks 13th in the world in defence expenditure and is the 12th largest exporter. Greater emphasis on this in the future will no doubt expand our capabilities in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Fisher, I have identified that opportunities in defence are one way we can grow and develop new industries on the coast. This will stimulate employment and prosperity, which will have long-term benefits for our growing community. As I mentioned earlier, I held the first Fisher defence industry forum in May of this year. We had over 170 representatives from small- to medium-sized businesses involved. We were fortunate to have the Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon. Christopher Pyne, attend as our guest speaker, and he certainly got the crowd excited about the future possibilities in defence. Following this very successful forum, I held a breakfast with retired Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston. I am now planning a workshop even next month that will educate interested businesses on how they can navigate their way through the defence industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government should be commended for identifying that Australians have a role to play in the development and sustainability of the defence industry in our own country. By investing record amounts of money and establishing a range of programs aimed at assisting Australian businesses to work with defence, the government is demonstrating that it has confidence that we can deliver in all areas of defence capability.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  We welcome the fact that the government has come to see the importance of a sovereign capability when it comes to the defence industry in this country. It would appear now to be something of a bipartisan view. It's taken time for the coalition to reach this point, but we will take them as they arrive. But it's important that this commitment on the part of the government to a defence industry in this country to support our nation's sovereign capability is something that is pursued in a way that is more than skin deep. Unfortunately, as we see in the way in which this is being handled at the moment, too much of the way in which the government is dealing with this, and has dealt with it since 2013, has actually had a negative impact in relation to jobs in the defence industry in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time that Labor left power in 2013, our maritime shipbuilding industry, in respect of Navy, was employing 4,000 people in this country. But we faced the prospect of the valley of death, which is not something that couldn't be foreseen. In essence, the air warfare destroyers and the LHDs were coming to a conclusion before the offshore patrol vessels and the future frigates would start the commencement of their work. Needing to find a way through the valley of death was something that was very much in the minds of those making policy on the Labor side of the equation. I note the presence in this chamber of the member for Eden-Monaro, who was around at that time, who worked tirelessly to conceive of a way in which we could work through the valley of death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of that was to have the building of the supply ship done in Australia, as well as bringing forward the construction of the offshore patrol vessels. What we saw was the supply ships being handed off to Spain, which is where they're now being constructed, and we still await a decision being made by this government on the preferred tenderer in respect of the offshore patrol vessels. That has seen the loss of somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 jobs in the shipbuilding industry in this country. Measured in terms of those employed in the defence industry, there is absolutely no doubt that we have watched it go backwards since this government came to power. In my electorate of Corio I have companies such as Chemring, Marand and Winchester—all important contributors to the defence industry. A vibrant defence industry in this country is critical for those businesses to continue their work and for people in my electorate to continue to be employed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far too often what we've seen on the part of the government is a greater interest in closing free trade agreements, for example, than in the defence industry. We saw the supply ships being bartered around in an attempt to close the Korean free trade agreement. We saw the submarines being put on the table in an attempt to close the free trade agreement with Japan. That had a lot to do with free trade agreement policy but not a lot to do with the defence industry policy for this country. Again we see that the commitment to defence industry is skin deep and highly political. A well thought through policy is not what we've seen from this government. We had perhaps the worst and most egregious example of that at the beginning of 2015, when Senator Sean Edwards from the other place made his support for the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, in a Liberal Party leadership dispute contingent upon a particular outcome of the defence industry policy in relation to submarines in Adelaide. That treated our nation's defence industry, our nation's Defence Force and the Australian public with utter contempt. The former defence minister was out there arguing that ASC was unable to build a canoe. Nothing said more about this government's contempt for the prospects and skills of the Australian workforce in relation to defence industry than that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen it happen in the last few days as well. At a hearing on Friday, a Senate committee saw an Australian government tender document in respect of our future frigates that said the Commonwealth is not mandating that the successful tenderer use the workforce of ASC Shipbuilding in the building of the future frigates. Again this government is abandoning Australian workers when it comes to working in Australia's defence industry. Frankly, it needs to do better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  It's my great pleasure to second the motion and to commend the government for the not just significant but incredible investment it's making in defence industry. The member for Corio, as he's leaving the chamber, really should hang his head in shame at the absolute misrepresentation that he's put up for the last five minutes. He's now left the chamber. He wasn't able to hang around for the real facts. But let's put the facts on the table. We hear about the valley of death. The valley of death happened under Labor. In six years, when Labor knew the valley of death was coming, Labor did not one thing to correct it. It did not commission one single naval vessel from an Australian yard, and the valley of death is now being remedied like never before by our government. Let's not forget that under Labor 119 defence projects were delayed, 43 projects were degraded, eight projects were cancelled and—I say again—not one single naval vessel from an Australian yard was commissioned to be built in this country in six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse, to give a strong indication as to how significant the failure by the previous Labor government was, Labor cut the Defence budget in 2012-13 to the lowest level of funding since 1938, at only 1.56 per cent of GDP. In contrast, very proudly, the Turnbull government will grow the Defence budget to two per cent of GDP, three years ahead of schedule, by 2020-21. That is because of our record $200 billion investment in the Australian Defence Force, including in some very important projects—building offshore patrol vessels, the submarine program, and our very comprehensive commitment to rebuilding our shipping industry in Australia. We're incredibly proud of what we're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we're also making a very significant investment in the Land 400 project. That's now, of course, down to a big fight between Queensland and Victoria. We're working very hard to secure that project and that $5 billion contract for Victoria. The Land 400 phase 2 project will acquire 225 combat reconnaissance vehicles. It's a very significant project. Of course, that will then go onto phase 3. I want to commend the work that's been done by my coalition colleagues in Victoria who are fighting for that project which we hope will see many jobs in both Melbourne and Geelong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very pleasingly, one of the most significant companies in our region is Marand. Marand has done some incredible work on the Joint Strike Fighter Project, constructing not only the trailer but also the tail for that particular aircraft. It is also partnering with BAE Systems in building the hull for BAE's vehicle, so it is wonderful to see, in contrast, perhaps, to Rheinmetall's bid, how much investment BAE is placing in this bid in terms of Australian defence jobs. That's what our commitment is all about. In contrast to Labor, we recognise that, when we invest in Australia's defence industry, we're also determined to invest in growing Australian defence jobs. It's been my great pleasure to conduct a number of roadshows on behalf of the Minister for Defence Industry, speaking about the opportunities for small- and medium-sized enterprises—which is very exciting—including, of course, on the Land 400 project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should just say that it was with great excitement that I joined the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Industry for the historic arrival of Australia's first two F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircrafts at the International Airshow in Avalon, which is an incredible showcase of our firepower, if you like—for want of a better word. It really is wonderful to see that more than 50 Australian businesses have already shared in $800 million of value in the F-35 production program, which has created 2½ thousand jobs around the country. So, unlike Labor's efforts, we are focused on delivering thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment, including, of course, in my great state of Victoria.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  This is an opportunity to really bell the cat on the lies that have been peddled in relation to defence expenditure. All sound commentators and fact checkers have pointed out that the percentage of GDP figure fluctuates dramatically through the course of an economy because of the fluctuation in the GDP statistics. It's really ironic that the coalition like to cite the 1938 figure. It was a coalition government at that time leading Australia down a blind alley in preparation for World War II. It was the Curtin government that took spending from that historic low to a near 30 per cent of GDP figure that put this country on track to actually fight off an existential threat. Of course, after that, it was under Labor governments in the seventies—during the Whitlam government and, of course, particularly during the Hawke-Keating years—when spending as a percentage of GDP never fell below two per cent. For five years, it was at 2.6 per cent—a figure that the Howard government never matched in its time and, in fact, was closest to those GDP figures of the 1930s. In fact, it was the Gillard-Rudd government that came the closest to that two per cent figure through those last six years by reaching 1.96 per cent, which this government has not yet reached. We had a promise from them of hitting two per cent and, this year, hitting 1.9 per cent, but that's not as high as the highest figure that Labor achieved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, in fact, took defence spending to a record level of $114 billion in our final budget, and, over the defence guidance period, we were going to be spending $333 billion. More importantly, as my colleague the shadow defence minister pointed out, we were going to bridge the valley of death on the back of, of course, Labor creating our naval shipbuilding industry by building the last two Adelaide class frigates, the Anzac frigates and the Collins submarines, which the Howard government then completely wasted. We had to spend a billion dollars rebuilding Australia's capacity in the workforce and industry to get that shipbuilding program rolling again. I had Defence advice, as the Minister for Defence Materiel, in relation to those supply vessels that said that not only could they be built here but they should be. That advice to me said that a full in-country build for SEA 1654—the supply vessels—could provide critical workflow to Australia's naval shipbuilding sector across all three shipyards, avoiding the costly decline of specialist skills between completion of the LHD and AWD projects and the start of Future Submarines. They said that optimisation—that is, local build—could overcome the imminent impact of the valley of death on sustainability of the national shipbuilding industry and retention of critical skills. There were no known reasons why either design they were contemplating could not be built entirely in Australia. That was our commitment prior to the 2013 election. This government sent those vessels to Spain, for Spanish jobs. They should've been built here and there would have been no valley of death. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Defence Industry likes to claim that we didn't commission a single vessel. That was because no planning had been done during the Howard government for the replacement of the submarines, for the supply vessels, for the offshore patrol vessels or for the patrol boats. We had to pick the ball up from ground zero. To give an idea of what is entailed in that, the replacement process for the Oberon class submarines began in 1978, and the first of those vessels didn't start hitting the water till the late nineties. The last boat hit the water in 2003. That demonstrates how long the planning process takes in commissioning vessels. How many locally built vessels, major fleet units, has this government commissioned in its four years? Zero. Let's get the facts right, let's get the record straight. Another member referred to the Land 400 project, which this government has also made a mess of, along with its record prior to us coming into government in 2007. We had to place 21 projects of concern into a special process, and there was the $1.4 billion lost entirely through its catastrophic Seasprite program, which we had to remediate by creating the Seahawk program. There was the landing craft that it spent $40 million on that didn't fit any vessel we then owned or were building—a completely wasted sum of money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs to focus on letting Austal and ASC be in the process for the bidding of the frigates. A complete lie is being told about Australian industry commitment to our projects. This government needs to get serious on that. We're very happy to work with it on ensuring that our industry is fully factored into the defence processes; let's actually put some substance on that instead of the constant politicisation we see from the Minister for Defence Industry.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  Small businesses have long been the foundation upon which Australia's prosperity has been built. In my electorate of Mackellar alone, there are 24,000 small businesses. Historically, government defence contracts have always been off limits to these small businesses, unreachable to all but the biggest defence contractors. Huge contracts were put to tender internationally, with the world's biggest players vying for a piece of the pie. I'm proud to say that this government has taken action to open the defence industry to our Australian small businesses. Recent changes spearheaded by the Minister for Defence Industry have made it significantly easier for Australian businesses of any size to access defence contracts. Our defence industry is much more than tanks and ships. We require a vast array of services, from software systems and professional services to maintenance support and from nuts and bolts to the paint used on our warships or the communication cables on our submarines. All of these can now be made in Australia by Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with the government's overhaul of the tendering process, we are delivering on our commitment to revitalise the Defence Force with a $200 billion investment—the largest since the Second World War. With $49 billion dedicated to developing Australia's enabling capabilities, this investment brings with it a plethora of opportunities for Australian businesses. This government has realised that we need to play the long game. Yes we want to make sure that our defence forces have the best, most cutting edge equipment to supply our forces, but we also realise that servicing that equipment and making it better and better requires us to develop the know-how here. Once a frigate is built, its individual components require maintenance and the engineers who worked on the original project will keep repairing, maintaining and improving the fleet for years to come. Investing in a local defence manufacturing industry means investing in jobs for generations to come. It's an investment in skills and innovation. Like a colony of mushrooms, once a business secures a defence contract, no matter how big or small, supporting businesses and industries grow around it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to encourage all businesses in Mackellar to get involved, to see what opportunities are open to them in defence and to tender for contracts, so they too can manufacture goods or provide services integral to Australia's defence and security. The Centre for Defence Industry Capability and the Defence Innovation Hub exist to facilitate small- and medium-sized Australian businesses entering the defence contracting supply chain by providing guidance and know-how. They liaise with businesses directly to help them maximise their competitiveness for defence contracts. Once in the defence supply chain, these businesses can use their skills to make the most of defence-related export opportunities, capitalising on Australia's close relationships with its defence allies and trade partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Countless Australian businesses have already started making the most of these opportunities. Over the next decade, the development of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter project, in which Australia has played a leading role, will result in over $1 billion in contracts for Marand Precision Engineering in Victoria. Closer to home, on the Northern Beaches, hydraulic engineering firm HI Fraser recently manufactured the millionth coupling needed for the Collins class submarine program. Recently this government, led by the Minister for Defence Industry, won an international tender to become one of only four worldwide F-35 Joint Strike Fighter service hubs. That means that Australian companies will be carrying out all high-level repairs in the Asia-Pacific region, firmly establishing us as a world player when it comes to defence servicing. This contract for the maintenance of military aircraft alone is forecast to create up to $100 million worth of business, and that's just initially. Programs such as this one also create hundreds of highly skilled, advanced manufacturing jobs, using Australian know-how from teams such as the one led by Richard Kirkby and Chris Williams at HI Fraser.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope all Australian businesses will seize this opportunity to get involved and to become part of the Australian defence industry. I would also like to thank the Minister for Defence Industry, the member for Sturt, for his consistent efforts to increase opportunities for Australian businesses in the defence industry. Ultimately, this is how we will secure prosperity for our great nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I must say, Deputy Speaker Price, it's wonderful to watch you sit there with such patience and not burst out laughing at the previous member's contribution. The member for Fisher wants us to pat the government on the back for their efforts to develop a defence export strategy, but we are wondering what he is actually proud of. Is he proud of the fact that this government's inaction is costing Australians jobs? Is he proud that, over the last four years in government, those opposite have been very quick to talk about defence expenditure but are very slow in actually delivering? The government has wreaked havoc on Victorian defence supply enterprises, leaving thousands of people without jobs, over the last two years alone. Australia is at risk of falling behind in defence industry exports, while the government is happy to sit comfortably at No. 5 in defence imports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will break that down for you. What it means is that those opposite are happy to spend billions of dollars in defence materiel projects overseas, but when in government they won't invest even a dollar to strengthen Victoria's shipyard capabilities. It's yet another example of this government's continuous neglect of Victorian infrastructure and Victorian jobs. The Victorian Minister for Industry and Employment, Wade Noonan, has warned the government repeatedly that if they don't relocate some defence building works to Victoria then the Williamstown shipyard will close. The Williamstown naval shipyard facility in Melbourne's west has over 1,000 highly skilled workers already employed on its projects. It has been one of the most effective and competitive naval shipyards in Australia and is known to have world-class facilities. The Victorian government has said that the future of the Williamstown shipyard and hundreds of Australian jobs are in the hands of the Turnbull government. Instead of directing money to a flourishing shipyard, the government admits that the projects it's funding in South Australia might not even have enough workers to support them. Why does the government insist on ignoring Victorian infrastructure? We were snubbed on the submarine announcement in 2016 and now we've been snubbed on defence building. It's absurd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the member for Fisher wants us to congratulate the government for encouraging Australian local small businesses to supply defence materials. From what I can see, this government is actually giving countries like Spain $13 billion in defence materiel contracts across shipbuilding and aviation. That is $13 billion going straight overseas, while Victorians can't keep their jobs. How exactly does the government think this is encouraging small and medium enterprises all over Australia to explore the opportunity to supply products and services for the ADF?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Key companies in the defence supply industry are sharing in Labor's fight for action to invest in our local industry. They want to know why the government doesn't have a greater focus on export in the industry, and why it is not focusing on this as a national mission. Labor understand that we must stand up and fight for the international strength of our defence industry because, if we don't, we will lose industry locally. That's an important point: we will lose industry locally. We want to see a thriving defence industry that gives all Australians a fair go and an opportunity to turn their production into overseas exports. We recognise that there is overseas demand, whether it be from OPVs or elsewhere, and we need to act now to secure a prosperous future for shipping yards like Williamstown. Even the good old Minister for Defence Industry has said that we need to reverse our figures and bring our exports up from 20th in the world. What is he actually doing about it? I will let the minister in on a little secret: just unveiling a defence export strategy doesn't make a difference. You actually have to do something about it. And, yet again, that's the part of his brainwave that this government is missing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's all well and good that the member for Fisher has moved this motion. He has been in here, praising the government's record investments in the ADF. But let's believe it when we see it. I certainly won't be holding my breath. It's time the government took real action and gave Australian businesses the opportunity to thrive. There is so much untapped potential in our small and medium enterprises, but if the government continues on this path these enterprises will be crippled. So I say to the government: get it together. Implement your so-called strategy. Until then, it's just a bunch of words on paper which certainly won't save our industry after suffering four years of failure and inaction by a government that is hopelessly divided and couldn't find its way out of a wet paper bag.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I would like to congratulate the member for McEwen on his speech. While it was clueless and totally missed the point, I give him full points for bravery. Who in their right mind from the Labor Party would stand up to speak to this motion and suggest for a moment that the Labor Party has a strong track record on defence? This is a Labor Party that had the lowest spending on defence since 1938—1.56 per cent of GDP. The coalition's plan is to raise it up to two per cent. And so full credit to the member for McEwen for his bravery. If only his facts matched his bravery then he actually might have good cause to stand in this chamber and try to suggest that the Labor Party actually has a good, demonstrable track record when it comes to defence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, the world today is in a situation of increased volatility. The uncertainty that is gripping us both politically and economically is throwing up a set of challenges that have led to the Turnbull coalition government investing in a capital program that is the largest recapitalisation that our Australian Defence Force has ever seen. This government is looking at a spend of $200 billion—that's with a B—out to the years of 2026-27. Ultimately, we'll see us reaching that benchmark of two per cent of GDP spend in years far earlier than previously planned, going streets ahead of where Labor had left us at 1.56 per cent of GDP. The hallmark of the government's approach is pulling together three pillars that historically have never worked as effectively as they are today under the leadership of the defence minister and the Minister for Defence Industry. Those three pillars are government itself, the Australian Defence Force and industry. The extraordinary thing about this is that the programs that the government is implementing are allowing our industry here domestically not only to supply content but also to develop deep expertise. We have a situation now where Australian industry is building new industries altogether. We have the creation of high-technology manufacturing companies that are not only starting up but also growing. We have an opportunity now, with the government's spending and pulling together of industry, the Australian defence forces and its own spend, to create a set of capabilities that position us beautifully for export.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look across the various aspects of the Australian defence forces, one area that grabs my attention is that of the Army and, in particular, the big Land projects: Land 200 and Land 400. As many people in this House might know, the Land 400 job is currently up for tender, and there are two companies in the bidding for that: Rheinmetall and BAE. Here we again have a situation where the Turnbull government is investing. In this case Land 400 phase 2 is $4 billion to $5 billion for 225 combat reconnaissance vehicles. These are going to be best in class around the world, built here locally. It gives an opportunity for us not only to use Australian steel and Australian technology, based in Australia with Australian workers, but also to build a capability that can then be used to export products, for us to be a net exporter of defence capability, because we'll have a sovereign industry that we previously have not had. That is why Land 400 phase 2 is so important, with phase 3 being an extra $15 billion. Together, that project alone, $20 billion, is the largest in the history of the Australian Army. In the context of potential jobs for Australia, it's larger than Adani. This is an enormous coup. What we have with this government is one that's determined to ensure government money is spent jointly with the Australian Defence Force and Australian industry, and thus I support the motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  It's critical for government to get defence expenditure and procurement right for several reasons—firstly, to ensure that our Defence Force is properly resourced to provide for Australia's security needs and to contribute to regional and global security, including through peacekeeping missions. As part of that, it's vital that our service women and men are supported to do their difficult and dangerous work as well and as safely as possible. We also have to get it right because defence expenditure, like all government spending, involves the allocation of scarce resources, making decisions that inevitably come with opportunity costs. The key issue here this evening is the question of how defence spending develops Australian capacity and expertise, creates jobs and builds on what is currently a below-par defence export industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I say more on that, I want to make a point in passing that there's a strange disconnect or blind spot in this government's approach to national security. There's a lot of chest-beating about defence expenditure reaching the highest level since 1994, but we hear virtually nothing, in pride or in sorrow, about the fact that Australia's international development budget will fall to 0.2 per cent of GNI, the lowest in our history. For a government that puts great stock in its national security credentials, it's bizarre that no-one in the government talks about the relationship between international assistance and regional peace and security. You simply cannot be serious about national or regional security and run down the delivery of well-targeted foreign aid in the way this government has done. You can't be serious about national and regional security while ignoring the looming and steepening impact of climate change. As former head of the Defence Force retired admiral Chris Barrie has said, our response so far to the 'existential threat' of climate change is not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad the government has embarked on a naval shipbuilding program, but I'm conscious there is an enormous challenge before all of us if we are to see that occur in a way that meets our strategic needs, provides value for money and leverages defence spending to create a domestic design, shipbuilding and sustainment capability. The fact is Australia performs poorly when it comes to the value of our defence related exports as a ratio of defence spending. Other nations with comparable levels of spending parlay that into export-earning opportunities for their businesses and jobs for their citizens. We do not, and we're kidding ourselves if we think that repairing that imbalance will be easy. On the contrary, what may well be easy, relatively speaking, is for other countries to have a very healthy piece of that $200 billion defence budget, and the evidence of the government's approach to date doesn't give a lot of confidence on that front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel for the member for Fisher. His motion was listed midweek, and on Friday there was evidence given to a Senate inquiry that the defence department chief had personally called the three international bidders who were part of the $35 billion future frigates program to tell them that they don't need to work with local companies. There was similarly concerning evidence given to the treaties committee about the $50 billion Future Submarines. I was very surprised as a member of that committee when we looked at the agreement to find that the relevant provision said the French government, through DCNS, would facilitate the involvement of Australian businesses on an equal basis with French companies. I thought to myself, 'Well, surely it's our money, it's our project; Australian companies ought to participate on a preferred basis, all things being equal,' and I sought to recommend a change to that aspect of the agreement, but government members preferred to merely call on the Australian government to revisit that principle in the detailed contractual arrangements. It does worry me that the high-level agreement between Australia and France on this very costly project was settled in language that set an unnecessarily weak obligation in terms of our industry's participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's pretty clear that there needs to be less self-congratulation from the government and a lot more application to the very difficult challenges ahead. Let me as a Western Australian say that, so far, with regard to support and opportunities for local companies and workers, whether they are companies like Austal or small and medium enterprises like the Henderson Alliance, from their point of view it's been a case of all show and no dough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence spending is serious stuff. It should be discussed in an open, warts and all fashion. It shouldn't be sacred territory. It must always be shaped by a rigorous consideration of our strategic needs. It must be fit for purpose. It must be determined and supervised by a civilian government free of any inhibition that regards defence as an area of decision-making in which only people with defence experience can fully participate. Finally, if we're serious about national security, we have to reconcile the current disconnect between our policies and expenditure on defence and our policies and expenditure on foreign aid and climate change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I'm pleased to support this motion moved by the member for Fisher, and in doing so I would like to highlight the unprecedented transformation that these defence projects will bring to the South Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, during which defence spending was cut to the lowest levels that we'd seen since before World War II and not one Australian built ship was commissioned, the defence industry needed an urgent rethink and a government that was actually serious about our national security and keeping our defence personnel safe. This is what Australians now have with the coalition government. We've taken on board the recommendations put forward in the defence industry white paper and we are implementing the nation's most comprehensive and forward thinking defence industry plan, which will not only keep Australians safe but also resurrect our industries in manufacturing and kickstart innovation across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a lot of credibility in this space, and I'd like to mention the extraordinary work of my South Australian colleague Senator David Fawcett, who was integral in developing the case for Australia to have fundamental inputs into defence industry capability. This is the idea that, for the sake of our national security, there are a range of industrial inputs which are important to build and sustain right here in Australia. I'm grateful to Senator Fawcett for introducing me to excellent South Australian based businesses like Saab, SAGE Automation and Cornell Design so I could see firsthand the benefits that defence contracts deliver to private sector companies and also to private sector jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just direct defence work that supports jobs. It's the technology, the learning and the innovation that these companies can then apply to other problems in the private sector and the civilian world that deliver additional value to our economy and jobs as well. To support the defence work beginning in South Australia, we have opened the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and launched the Defence Innovation Hub. These will facilitate close collaboration between the private sector, Defence and AusIndustry to ensure local businesses of all sizes are seizing the opportunities to participate in our record $200 billion investment in defence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key part of the strategy is the Naval Shipbuilding Plan, and we have commissioned 54 vessels to be built in Australia over the next decade. We have launched the Naval Shipbuilding College, because we have to provide 5,000 workers by the mid-2020s in naval shipbuilding. We are doing the sustainment here and we are doing the maintenance here, which will create thousands of local jobs. We need to find those skilled people apprenticeships in welding and fitting and turning, because we're building the defence industry in this country like it has never been built before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shipbuilding plan will give Australian businesses opportunities to take part in delivering defence contracts and transfer the knowledge, technology and skills they develop into other areas in our economy. This will assist in the expansion of businesses into new markets, allowing them to competitively pursue lucrative export opportunities. Through our initial investment, we will be enabling local businesses to build their industrial capabilities and practices so they can compete globally and build our defence export capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be a game changer for South Australia's economy. Between the nine future frigates, the 12 submarines and the offshore patrol vessels, the defence industry is booming in South Australia. In fact, in the last quarter defence spending jumped a massive 23 per cent. In July, construction for the upgrades to infrastructure began at the shipyards at Osborne in Adelaide, signalling the beginning off our bright shipbuilding future. There will be 2,000 jobs created by this project alone. Not long after the frigate build begins, work will start on the 12 submarines. This $50 billion investment in our nation's defence and defence industry will create a total of 2,800 jobs in my home state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we must understand that this investment would be at risk if the opposition were to take government. Our achievements in defence capability policy stand in stark contrast to the actions of those opposite when they were last in government. They failed to commission a single naval vessel from an Australian shipyard during their entire time in office, which led to the valley of death. During their time in government, Labor cut $18.8 billion from the Defence budget. They delayed 119 defence capability projects, they reduced 43 projects in scope and they outright cancelled another eight, risking critical security and capability gaps. Their defence spending fell to 1.56 per cent of GDP. Unlike those opposite, we will always stick by our Defence Force personnel and have our national security as our top priority.</span>

While not agreeing with the intent of every word in this motion, I think it is always important for us to talk about support for our defence forces. I was fortunate enough to spend nine days in the Middle East with our troops. This included spending time at bases in Afghanistan with the men and women of the ADF to see firsthand the amazing work they do and learn about the equipment they use. The experience left me with a greater respect for Defence Force personnel and the incredible sacrifices they make to serve our great country. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all else it was clear to see the professionalism and commitment of our serving personnel on display 24/7. Our troops are the best in the world and they are incredibly dedicated to serving our country. In our local community there are many ADF families, and I know it must be tough to be separated from loved ones whilst they serve. The reputation for the ADF extends beyond our borders to accompanying nations who also have personnel serving in the region. Members of our ADF put themselves at risk every single day, which is why it is important that we provide our troops with the best equipment available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the member for Fisher also spoke about encouraging small- and medium-sized enterprises all over Australia to explore the opportunity to supply products and services for the ADF. Both of these elements will be realised if and when the government awards the Land 400 contract to Rheinmetall to build their Boxer CRV vehicle in Queensland, my home state, or more specifically in Ipswich. As newly elected Mayor Antoniolli said, Ipswich has a proud military history, with 7,500 defence workers in the city. I was very pleased to see last week the front page of our local paper, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Q</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ueensland Times</span>, with the headline 'Ipswich declares war on unemployment'. It said that a $5 billion military contract would bring 350 jobs right across our region. Not only is the Boxer CRV an outstanding vehicle for the Defence Force to serve and protect our troops, but the project would also, as I said, bring some 300 to 400 jobs to the Ipswich region if the bid was successful whilst at the same time pumping more than $5 billion into the state's economy over the next 10 years. I was delighted to attend the announcement of this significant project alongside my state Labor colleagues, the Minister for State Development, Anthony Lynham, and the Premier of Queensland, at Archerfield Airport in July where we were treated to seeing the Boxer CRV on the airstrip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rheinmetall have committed to establishing an $80 million manufacturing centre in my home city of Ipswich, with products flowing not only to the Australian Army but right across the world. With news last month that, sadly, two major businesses in the region would be closing their doors, a decision to give Rheinmetall the Land 400 contract would be an announcement truly welcomed by the Ipswich community. If the LNP is serious about investing in Queensland, if this government is serious about listening, and with a record majority of members from Queensland, its federal members shouldn't be giving any more lectures—I want the government to get on with the job and choose Queensland. Companies have been selected to deliver a range of products and services right across the state to enable delivery of the Boxer CRV. I acknowledge the state government for the enormous amount of work it has done under the leadership of Premier Anastasia Palaszczuk and Minister Lyneham, who have been working so hard to attract Rheinmetall to Queensland, to make sure that this becomes a reality. The confidence that Rheinmetall is showing in Queensland is a vote of confidence in Queensland's small- and medium-sized businesses. This supports the Palaszczuk government's focus on attracting more jobs and more industry to Queensland. It is projects like these that bring invaluable jobs and opportunities to local businesses. I commend Rheinmetall and the Palaszczuk government on their ambition to bring this project to Ipswich and I look forward to seeing a positive announcement later this year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to speak to this motion calling on the government to develop a national regional higher education strategy. As all regional MPs know, regional universities do more than educate—they are a critical player in workforce planning; they are a driver of economic growth and development; they are key employers; they innovate; they inspire; they act as major attractors to young people; and they can make the difference between economic survival and the totally undesirable alternative. However to ensure regional higher education is prioritised and remains a focus for federal governments beyond today, we must have a long-term commitment which is coordinated and has bipartisan support. We must have a national strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community, access to high quality tertiary education is a recognised priority. In a post-budget survey of more than 1,000 people across the electorate held in May this year, 92 per cent of respondents identified education as their top priority. Regional universities demonstrate that access to high quality tertiary education does more than educate the future workforce in regional communities; they play a central role in the economic, social and cultural development of the regions and, consequently, the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past year I have worked really closely with La Trobe University and Charles Sturt University in my electorate and the Regional Universities Network. They also agree that we need a strategic approach to the future. I say to my friends on the government side: can you work with me on this? All the regional MPs in this place know that high-quality tertiary education is a major driver of economic development and should not be seen in isolation from other regional development issues. I want to acknowledge my parliamentary colleague Senator McKenzie and the leadership role she has played to progress this. In the government's regional 2030 statement they have said they want to build the kind of sustainable regional communities our children and grandchildren either want to stay in or come back to. This will mean thinking beyond the next election. To address this need, the government established the Regional Australia Ministerial Taskforce in March. We were told that a cross-portfolio task force was the best way to implement good regional policy, and that the task force would focus on closing the gap between the bush and the city, in terms of health, education and infrastructure, and would continue to invest in rural, regional and remote Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But central to good regional policy is a recognition of the workforce and economic development requirements of the community. This is underpinned by TAFEs and universities. The Regional Universities Network, RUN, reports that about three-quarters of those who study at regional universities stay in the regions to work. Conversely, students who leave their communities to take up university studies in major cities are much less likely to return home after graduating. A national strategy would support the role of regionally based higher education providers in creating diverse and resilient regional economies, and take into consideration other relevant policies and programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Department of Education is currently conducting an independent review into regional, rural and remote education, and their discussion paper tells us that it will consider key challenges and barriers that impact on students' learning outcomes, including transitions towards the future regarding study, training and employment. But there is a missing piece in this discussion paper; this review does not address regional universities and those who choose to study there. This seems inconsistent with the government's decentralisation agenda, and, notably, the government's decision to relocate the APVMA to Armidale, with one of the key election criteria for the new office being that it is within a 10-kilometre radius of the University of New England. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to reflect on the words from today's editorial in my local paper, Albury-Wodonga's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Border</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mail</span>:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… larger regional centres, such as Albury-Wodonga, have benefited from a university presence. In the Border’s case, it has had the added plus of go-ahead TAFE colleges – especially in Wodonga.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The editorial cites Charles Sturt University and La Trobe University, and continues: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… all must be done to ensure there is no attempt to water-down these universities at a time when their commitment is to expand in order to even better serve regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our universities rightly deserve ongoing, long-term support because they fill a role that will never be matched by the nation’s ivy league club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is so important we have strong regional universities. Tonight, I'm saying to the government: pay attention to the regions. The way forward that I see is to have a national strategy that has long-term bipartisan support and delivers the students, the economy and the cultural changes we need. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Indi for bringing this motion before the parliament. It gives me an opportunity to discuss the coalition's electoral commitment of $15.2 million from 2017-18 to 2020-21 to establish up to six regional study hubs across Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Grey we have the Upper Spencer Gulf region, consisting of three small cities—Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta—with a combined population of about 50,000 people, plus the rural catchment. In total, there are perhaps 70,000 people—an ideal number to establish a regional study hub. A considerable amount of work has already been done by the Upper Spencer Gulf Common Purpose Group on a proposal similar to the Community Owned Tertiary Education Campus—COTEC—at Geraldton, which I know you are very much aware of, Madam Deputy Speaker Price, and the one in Cooma. A delegation from the Upper Spencer Gulf has visited Geraldton. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that currently UniSA have a regional campus in Whyalla. The courses available have been expanded in recent years, and I thank UniSA for their interest and support. It's important that whatever we do does not negatively impact on them. There are a huge range of degrees, trades and diplomas that a co-tech facility could deliver without impacting on UniSA, and that is certainly my intention. UniSA currently delivers foundation studies, an Aboriginal pathways program, business, education—early childhood and primary teaching degrees—engineering, nursing and social work studies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian Tertiary Education Centre, or SATEC, tell us that there are 2½ thousand enrolments from the Upper Spencer Gulf region each year in the university sector. All kinds of reasons exist to enrol on campus but, equally, there are all kinds of reasons not to enrol on campus: the cost of relocation; family, including parental responsibilities; and emotional insecurity. And some people just don't like living in the city. I know that's hard to believe, but it is the truth. Some people don't like living in the city. More information from SATEC tells us that those who enrol in online courses that offer face-to-face support have completion rates better than 80 per cent. Comparatively, of those who enrol in online courses that do not have that support, fewer than 20 per cent complete their courses. What a waste of time and resources! It shows how much difference face-to-face support can make, and that's what the proposed facility can provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The city-country divide is always an issue for us. In urban Australia 31 per cent of the population have completed degrees. In regional Australia, that figure is 15 per cent. The average level of those holding qualifications above certificate level in South Australia is 23 per cent. In the Upper Spencer Gulf this figure is just 11 per cent. This is a serious deficit, and it needs to be addressed. Our regions hold great promise and are essential to the success of South Australia and Australia. We need to unlock our potential. The time is right. A combination of events has lifted the pall that has hung over the Upper Spencer Gulf in recent times. Nyrstar are close to commissioning a new multimetal processing facility in Port Pirie. OZ Minerals has announced the go-ahead of the Carrapateena project. There'll be 1,000 jobs there. BHP, at Olympic Dam, is ramping up production and has announced a shop local campaign. The federal government is backing solar thermal concentrated with storage in Port Augusta. Defence is investing strongly in Cultana and Woomera. And perhaps the biggest of all is the completion of the sale of Arrium assets to Mr Sanjeev Gupta, with the facility in Whyalla now called Liberty OneSteel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the resources crash, local employers have shied away from taking on apprentices and trainees. That's understandable. During the slowdown, older, experienced workers took packages and retired. That's also understandable. There is an increasing concern as to where our skilled workers will come from for this surge of investment that is almost upon us. Time is of the essence. The quicker we get started on this project, the quicker we can offer cost-competitive opportunities to start the supply of skilled workers that we will need. The Upper Spencer Gulf proposal focuses on the strengths and existing assets. It offers a new option for our TAFE facilities, sadly neglected and underutilised by the South Australian government. They have the sites and buildings, and with cooperation we can utilise the unused capacity. It's planned that the facility will provide that space to work in and that qualified locals will be sourced to provide tutorial support. However, registered trainers and education providers will provide the course content and award qualifications. I will fully back their submission when it arrives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="262273" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KEAY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  I thank the member for Indi for bringing forward this very important matter of regional universities for debate. Universities play a critical role in regional Australia, and I am a beneficiary of one of them. They are an active presence in regional communities, providing pathways to a tertiary education that would otherwise not be available. In my electorate, having a local presence is absolutely vital when you consider the disproportionate number of people engaged in higher education in regional areas. The Torrens University publication <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Health Atlas</span><span style="font-style:italic;">es</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> of Australia</span> states that Braddon school leaver participation in higher education, at an average of 18.58 per cent, is lower than the Tasmanian average of 29.2 per cent and the Australian average of 31.3 per cent. More needs to be done, but I am heartened by the commitment by the University of Tasmania to retaining the Cradle Coast campus in my electorate, in Burnie. The Cradle Coast campus offers full degrees plus, now, associate degrees for a wide range of courses. Currently there are around 800 students enrolled. The Cradle Coast campus also offers a range of opportunities for course and research-based postgraduate study, located at the Cradle Coast campus, directly related to local industry needs. This includes PhDs in agricultural science through the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture and in regional development through the Institute for Regional Development.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To build on this work, I was also pleased that during the 2016 election campaign the Leader of the Opposition committed $150 million to the UTAS Northern Transformation Project. The proposal includes new research and teaching facilities in Launceston and a new learning centre in Burnie at the Cradle Coast campus. It will offer even more opportunities for regional students and more study options. UTAS estimates the project will draw more than 12,000 new students and create 3,100 jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is somewhat telling that the Prime Minister was dragged kicking and screaming to match Labor's commitment in the dying days of the election campaign. When you look at what the coalition is trying to do to higher education for regional students, it is easy to understand why there was such a delay. The coalition just does not get it. First, there were the $100,000 degrees and massive cuts under the former Prime Minister that would have hit regional students the hardest. This Prime Minister is no better. He is trying to impose a $4 billion cut to universities, increase student fees and reduce the payment threshold for HELP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, these cuts mean approximately $51.3 million will be lost from the University of Tasmania. These cuts could see the end of the highly successful Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program, or HEPPP, which was introduced by Labor. The Liberals and Nationals have already cut nearly $200 million from the HEPPP program. Under Labor, HEPPP increased Indigenous student numbers by 26 per cent and regional student numbers by 30 per cent, and supported more than 36,000 extra students from low-income families to attend university. I recently read that the Group of Eight, which used 30 per cent of its HEPPP funding for outreach into regional areas, could also be under threat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former UTAS vice-chancellor Peter Rathjen has previously been on the public record as saying that these cuts to UTAS could threaten the future of regional campuses. What sort of madness is it when decisions of this government potentially threaten the viability of regional campuses like Cradle Coast? What sort of madness is it when the government is prepared to invest $150 million in UTAS infrastructure for the Northern Transformation Project, but at the same time threaten its viability and potentially starve students of the opportunity to attend? The Turnbull government has clearly lost the plot when it comes to supporting universities in regional areas. Cutting funding, axing programs, putting up fees and reducing the payment threshold for HELP all combine to make it harder for regional students to obtain a higher education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than continue to cut in the mould of his predecessor, the Prime Minister should look to Labor. We introduced the demand-driven funding system that saw more than 190,000 additional places for university, many in regional areas. Opportunities for regional students grew under Labor. Under the coalition, they will most certainly shrink. It is time those opposite, especially from the regions, followed Labor's lead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  I thank the member for Indi for bringing this matter before the parliament. She very accurately reflects the fact that, for regional areas, the presence and activities of our universities are very significant to us. In my own area, the University of Wollongong is a world-class provider of education and research, and that is critically important. But, just as importantly to us as a region, it's also a major employer—in fact, it's one of the top five employers in our region now. It's a place of a significant number of small businesses, in terms of the sorts of facilities that are provided there. It's a partner with many other industries and businesses in developing emerging opportunities in our region to make sure that innovation and new opportunities are grasped across the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />That's reflected in the fact the university produced a report called <span style="font-style:italic;">Leading locally, co</span><span style="font-style:italic;">mpeting globally: measuring the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">University of Wollongong's contribution to economic and social prosperity</span>. This was a review of the 2015 year and a look at how the university contributed to the local and, indeed, national economic effort. Interestingly, that report showed that the total direct, indirect and induced economic contribution to GDP in 2015 by the university was $1.2 billion. The direct contribution to the Illawarra, in value-added terms, was $573 million. That was an increase of 7.7 per cent since it was last looked at in 2011. So the member for Indi is absolutely accurate when she talks about the fact that our regional universities are major drivers of economic activity in our regions. That's why we're so passionate about seeing them continue to prosper and grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just give a few examples from that report about the sorts of activities the university contributes to which are transforming our region and driving a significant economic transformation in the Illawarra. In particular, the $600 million Innovation Campus is an award-winning research, innovation and commercial precinct. It has a number of research entities there. These institutions work across things like intelligent, innovative materials, regenerating damaged human nerves, the development of superconductors to make energy transmission more efficient, new techniques for sustainable building design and areas of maritime law and security. Several multinational and national companies are resident at that campus, strongly engaged with the university, such as NEC Australia and TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. About 1,500 people work just at that campus, and the employment is expected to pass 5,000 in the next five to 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The university also works through the iAccelerate Centre to set up new businesses. It's an incubator program, the first of its kind in Australia, putting together mentoring and education programs. Already it has supported 65 start-up companies, creating 143 jobs. Nine companies have had new product launches, and six companies have expanded their international presence. Really importantly to me, 47 per cent of the start-up companies have female co-founders. In the innovation and start-up sector, that is a pretty amazing outcome which the university have specifically worked to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're also working with our existing industry sectors to help them become more innovative and to have a future. The innovative manufacturers in the regions have joined with the university researchers to form the Southern Manufacturing Innovation Group, which is 13 Illawarra based manufacturers. It's using innovation by collaborating between the businesses and the university researchers. It is a great initiative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to report that steel is also still going strong. Of course, the original BHP, now BlueScope, was a very significant founder of the university. There are still research hubs operating between the university and BlueScope in order to develop pathways to get new products to market. The member for Indi is absolutely right: the government needs to understand the significance of our regional universities and to back them.</span>

                  <a href="230531" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:08</span>):  Tonight I'm on duty and it gave me great pleasure when I came in here to see the topic of conversation put forward by the honourable member for Indi was national regional higher education. Being a proud regional seat holder myself in Queensland, where the largest contributor to GDP in my electorate is agriculture, I thought it would be fitting that I make a contribution to the debate. Within the boundaries of my electorate is none other than the UQ's Gatton Campus, which produces for Queensland and the eastern seaboard the vast majority of vets going into the agricultural sector for large equines and other large animals. They've got some amazing programs there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally to that, in Toowoomba we have the USQ Toowoomba Campus, we have the Springfield Campus—which is, again, a USQ campus—and we have the Gold Coast campus. I'm on the border of Griffith and on the border of Bond University, so there's a lot of overflow of my seniors. When I take headshots from my students when I'm speaking to them, I ask how many are going to university, how many are going to trades and how many are going home. Each year I have seen the numbers grow exponentially, from around 20 per cent to now 40 per cent of my senior students taking the position that they will go to university. The reason they want to go to university is that our evidence tells us that those children who are educated in the university system, over their working life, will generate, on average, an extra $1 million. That's a great incentive for them to go to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I firstly thank the member for Indi for bringing this topic to the House, because it is such an important issue. I want to share with you some intricacies of my own life. When I left school I had an entrepreneurial flair. I started my own business. I bought some trucks, I bought some more trucks and then I bought many trucks. I had 14 depots around the state and I employed 105 people, so I never had the opportunity to go to university. I was, by any stretch of the imagination, well off in the way of finances, but there was something that burned for me. I thought less of myself because I had not been to university. Recently, whilst I was in the position of Chief Government Whip, I started a masters program. I'm just about on the home straight. It is so difficult to be a member, to work in your electorate, to have the commitments that you have in you life, to be in this place and to study. When everybody else is going home to bed, you're out there trying to bash out assignments. It is a challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to make a contribution to the debate tonight because I think that university gives you that couple of letters after your name and allows you to make a contribution to a debate where you are seen as an equal. By any stretch of the imagination my balance sheets would've been superior to most in any conversation, but I felt that I was lacking because I didn't have that university degree. I'm out having a crack. I've got a bet with my daughter. She's studying at USQ, doing her environmental science degree. I've got a bet with her that I'm going to finish before she does. I suggest that I probably won't. It'll be an amazing bottle of Penfolds that I have to depart with, along with a trip around the world and 12 months worth of wages. It was a substantial bet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will come back to what I alluded to earlier on in my speech, which is that in my electorate the largest contributor to GDP is agriculture. The advances that are coming out of our technology and out of our universities are revolutionising the way that we do business. There is satellite tracking in John Deere tractors. They virtually no longer need a driver, but you sit there so that they've got someone listening to the radio in the cab. Those tractors will do the most perfect line. They will actually do sampling in a paddock and drop the right amount of fertiliser behind you to make sure that you get your optimum yields. Our growers, because they have access to the UQ Gatton Campus, are embracing technology. I would just like to, in my closing comments, thank the member for Indi for bringing this to the House.</span>
