                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2018 contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to assist Australian businesses and consumers and further enhance the operation of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the bill will make amendments consistent with Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2018, providing a 'free' rate of duty for imports of Indonesian insecticides and herbicides under the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement. This proposal implements an early outcome of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement that commenced on 20 September 2017 as announced by my colleague, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, the Hon Steven Ciobo. This early outcome benefits Australian businesses and farmers by reducing their costs and improving access to the Indonesian market for Australian sugar exporters. It both reduces the cost of insecticides and pesticides for Australia's farmers, adding important margin to their businesses, enabling them to make further investments in their farms, in their businesses, but at the same giving greater access for Australian sugar producers into the Indonesian market, a large and fast-growing market for sugar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill will make amendments consistent with Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2018, which will remove the duty payable on eligible blinded clinical trial kits and placebos imported for use in clinical trials. This measure was announced in the 2018-19 budget and complements the government's efforts on making Australia an attractive destination for international clinical trials. The measure makes the importation of these goods into Australia cheaper through the removal of customs duty while also simplifying the import process and reducing red tape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill will make a technical amendment to schedule 12 which covers the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This amendment removes a redundant item from the schedule, realigning it with the other schedules to the Customs Tariff Act.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In combination, this bill provides further support for the government's strong focus on reducing red tape, finding access to new markets and reducing costs for Australian businesses in everything they do. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:36</span>):  As I said in my address to the House on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 last night, there is not a local government area in the Calare electorate that is not being affected by drought, from Lithgow to Blayney and through to the Wellington area. There is immense stress and immense pain amongst the farming communities. That's why I was so pleased to see the extension of the farm household allowance, because it delivers real help on the ground, where people need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also pleased to see that the Regional Investment Corporation is moving ahead. Last week we had board members, including the chair and acting CEO, visit Orange to help launch the Regional Investment Corporation and to source office premises in Orange. This is important because one of the key functions of the Regional Investment Corporation is to deliver concessional loans for drought-affected farmers. It's a really important facility for country Australia. It's also going to deliver $2 billion in water infrastructure finance and loans. It is basically an organisation with $4 billion in its loan books, but it exists to help country communities, to assist farmers when they need it most and to build stronger country communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has, therefore, been very surprising to experience the negative attitudes from the member for Hunter over the development of the Regional Investment Corporation, because folks out in country Australia get decentralisation and its importance. We've had some big hits on our local areas right across the central west in terms of jobs in recent years, including the closure of Electrolux, Australia's last fridge manufacturing plant, which took more 550 jobs. So people are dumbfounded, I think, in country areas when you have politicians coming out and saying we shouldn't have decentralisation. In fact, out in our neck of the woods, the member for Hunter is known as the shadow minister for recentralisation. He comes out and says that the Regional Investment Corporation will be torn apart if the opposition get in. It's going to be very interesting to see how the opposition campaigns on taking jobs away from the central west during the next election. I'm going to watch that development with great interest because that's essentially what they're saying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It totally ignores the fact that the whole reason the Regional Investment Corporation exists is to help farmers through concessional loans. To date, there have been $834 million in concessional loans approved. This is making a real difference on the ground to farmers. That's why the RIC, as it's known to its many friends, is so important to keep that work going and to expand that good work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I give immense credit to the member for New England for his work in putting the RIC together, and also to the minister for agriculture, who has been very supportive of the RIC's development as well. It's part of a suite of drought-relief policies that the federal government has implemented, including the Farm Management Deposits Scheme, which allows eligible primary producers to set aside pre-tax income from primary production in years of high income which can be drawn on in future years. Under that scheme, they can deposit up to $800,000. They can access their FMD early without losing their claimed taxation concessions if they are affected by drought, and they can offset the interest costs on primary production business debt, subject to banks offering FMD loan offset accounts. So there are a suite of measures available at the moment, but I think it's really important that the Australian government looks at the situation on the ground and ramps up the response as the conditions worsen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aussie farmer is one of the iconic images of our nation. Farmers have been a powerhouse of economic growth in recent years, but we can't take them for granted. Australian farmers are resilient, but I think there's also a feeling that Aussie farmers will always be there. Well, that's not necessarily the case. They're humans and they are suffering immense stress at the moment—about how they're going to feed their stock, where their stock are going to go, what's going to happen to their farms, how they're going to get fodder in, whether they're going to have any breeding stock left and whether they're going to be able to rebuild their paddocks. As I said, some paddocks in the central west at the moment resemble moonscapes. How are they going to be able to rebuild the dams? How are they going to rebuild the genetics in their herds? All of these issues are causing immense strain and stress and are taking a toll. It has to be said: it's taking an immense toll. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They need our help, and we as a nation need to answer that call. This bill does answer that call, but the conditions are so bad and the outlook is so grim that more will be needed. Unless some decent rains come soon, more help is going to be needed. We are going to have to keep ramping up the support and the assistance as the conditions worsen. I urge all Australians, particularly those in cities, to support our farmers and to remember that our farmers are the ones who actually put food on the table for the nation. People in cities, I think, go into the supermarket and take for granted that that food just appears. But it doesn't just appear; that food comes from our Australian farmers in electorates across our nation. They are our fellow Australians and we can't take them for granted. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House. I congratulate the minister for agriculture on his work. I thank him for visiting the central west in recent times and hearing firsthand about how the drought is affecting farmers in our area. I also am very happy with the work that's been put into the Regional Investment Corporation. But, again, as the conditions worsen, the response has to be ramped up. Our Australian farmers have helped power our national economy in recent times. We have relied on them for our nation's wealth and prosperity, and now we as a nation need to be there for them. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

Mr Speaker, I look across the chamber and see that you're a strikingly good-looking man. I was looking at the tie that you got on there, and I bet you that tie is not made in Australia.

                    </a>  You haven't? Well, if you did, it wouldn't have been made in Australia. There are two screens in front of you. Neither of them are from Australia. If I went into your house, Mr Speaker, I bet you cook on a Bosch stove because you like that German style of engineering. And no doubt the television you watch would probably be a Samsung—no, you'd be above a Samsung. You'd have a Japanese television, I imagine—something pretty flash!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything in your life, Mr Speaker, has basically come in on a boat from overseas. And the only reason it comes in on a boat from overseas is that somebody somewhere must be sending something in the other direction. And guess who those people are. It's all those terrible live cattle producers, terrible beef producers, shocking live sheep producers, all those wool producers and those terrible people in the irrigation industry. All are earning export dollars for our nation. What about those terrible miners, terrible coalminers out there earning a dollar for our nation? All are earning export dollars so we can have the expectation of the standard of living which is so present and so manifest in everything we do at the moment and in how we live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to support these people. It's not just a form of charity. We've got to support these people to support ourselves. We have to support people through drought because they live with the vagaries of the climate. They live with the vagaries of the climate in such a form that they make money if it rains. If the season goes with them, if luck goes with them, they can make the export dollars to support our standard of living. When a drought happens, it quite obviously is a disaster not only for them but for the whole economy. The agricultural economy was the fastest-growing sector in recent times in our nation. I'm happy with the work this government has done, now and when I was the minister, to make sure that came about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are always going to have to manage droughts, but to manage droughts we must make sure that there is dignity maintained in the household so that, if hard times come, they can pay their chemist bill, they can pay their grocery bill and they can pay for their fuel. That is why we needed the farm household allowance. When we started, when we came to government, 367 people had got it off Labor. Now it's getting close to 8,000 people because we changed the criteria so that we could keep that dignity in the house, keep that dignity at the kitchen table. The lady of the house or the fellow or lady if they are by themselves know that there is at least some money coming in so they could pay some of those bills. Otherwise, they had nothing. It is not like they had social security in the cities if they lost their job; these people had nothing. They literally had to go without all. That is not respecting the dignity of the people on the land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, with this further extension, I want to commend the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. The extension for a further year means we've got four years. This is vitally important because a lot of people are coming to the end of the three-year period and were going to run out. They were going to be left in an invidious position, because they would have nothing. On top of that, we're heading towards a billion dollars worth of concessional loans. I think it's about $850 million worth of concessional loans. I might remind the House that, when we came to government, the Labor Party had knocked eight concessional loans out the door.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making sure we maintain that. We set up the Regional Investment Corporation so we would have an ongoing institution to properly manage this and to have a capacity to increase its mandate to look after the people on the land because they're looking after us. Just like the coalminers, the bauxite miners and the iron ore miners, so are the sorghum producers, the wheat producers, the beef producers, the sheep producers and the wool producers—they are looking after us, so we must look after them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing every time I listen to the Labor Party—they're supposed to have a strong social conscience, which is one of the vestiges of the Labor Party—because all they talk about is tearing these things down. They're going to dismantle the Regional Investment Corporation. I've never heard what they're going to put in its place—not once. They want to move APVMA from Armidale back down to Canberra. Why? Because they don't believe in decentralisation. They don't have a vision for regional Australia. They have no money on the table for the inland rail. They have none. We listened to their story. There is no money on the table for inland rail from the Labor Party. They have no vision for a greater regional Australia—none. We believe that we have to stand behind the dignity of these people and to drive their economies forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've expended on the Farm Household Allowance so far is approaching a quarter of a billion dollars—$230 million. I commended the New South Wales state government the other day for their $50,000 seven-year interest-free loan. I had a look at some of the conditions on it. I think it's going to be a tough one to get your hands on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say once more that when the state asks, 'What have we done?' We've got close to a quarter of a billion dollars now that we've paid out in the Farm Household Allowance. The New South Wales government has to put their hand in their pockets for freight subsidies. They must do that. That's their role. That's their job. I commend them for what they announced the other day with the Malpas pipeline at Armidale. It's about $12½ million. Good luck to them. Well done. We were fighting for it as well, but you've paid for it. Well done. It is very important during the drought to get pipelines in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But most important now, during this drought what people are asking for, what farmers are asking for, are freight subsidies for fodder, for the movement of cattle, for the movement of sheep and for the movement of water. I had to bring in fodder myself the other day—I've got a couple of blocks—and it came from Gatton in Queensland. It cost thousands and thousands of dollars to move fodder. You've just got to do it. Buying cotton seed is important, as is trying to keep the basis of the herd together. God willing, a few showers are going over at the moment, but even if they go over and even if it rains it's the middle of winter, so you're not going to get a lot of fodder growth out of that. You'll start to get some subsoil moisture. Around about August you'll start to get some growth. Then, of course, you've got to wait for the place to pasture back up again so that you can start improving conditions for cattle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you sell your cows now you're going to get nothing for them. No-one wants old cows in drought as that's not how you make money. You've got to be able to get your hands on the money to support those stock, to support your herd, to get to the other end of the drought, so you can get a cash flow up and running again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all part and parcel of what a caring government does. What we need is as we have articulated—a clear vision on this side of the House with 100 per cent write-off on water reticulation and 100 per cent write-off on fencing, and write-off over three years for fodder storage for your silos and for your hay sheds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We took farm management deposits from $400,000 to $800,000. I was trying for a million. I got $800,000. We passed the legislation that you could have a write-off against the money you owe the bank. If you owe the bank $1 million and you have $800,000 in farm management deposits, the bank should just charge you interest on the $200,000 difference. We've done that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a banking royal commission on at the moment and the banks are saying they're doing a fair job and there's nothing to see here. They've got a few problems but they're trying to defend their position. But I'll put something to you: the banks should immediately, all of them—not just the rural banks—should now be processing the capacity, so that if you have a farm management deposit and you have money owed to the bank, these things can be netted out and you only pay the interest bill on the difference. That's what's supposed to happen. I'll tell you what they're doing. It can work like this: the bank says, 'Okay, you've got $800,000 in farm management deposits to help you through a drought. We'll give you three per cent on that. Then we're going to lend you the money you need, the million dollars you need, at seven per cent or eight per cent with an overdraft, so you'll probably have a four per cent differential.' A four per cent differential on $800,000—four eights are 32—means they're touching for $32,000 a year. I don't know whether anybody said anything up at the royal commission about that, but they should. This is something that should be happening right now to show their support during the drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've clearly showed is we support people during the drought not because it's charity but because it's an economic necessity. It's an economic necessity that we continue to maintain our export dollars if we want to maintain our standard of living that is so apparent in everything we do in our lives. The people in towns are usually pretty good. It is the people in the cities who have to understand. They have to look into their lives and say, 'How much of my life was actually produced in this nation? My shoes, my shirt, my socks, my car, my phone—most of it's produced overseas.' We have to support the people who put things on the boat and send it in the other direction. That is one of the reasons why we have to support people through drought: they are one of the key people who do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is if you allow the collapse of farming families during a drought—because they're the people most likely to be hurt—then you'll slowly, piece by piece, get a greater progression of the corporatisation of the Australian landscape. I don't want that. I want to make sure that we have Australian mums and dads as the predominant owners of the Australian asset, just like how we have Australian mums and dads as the predominant owner of the house in the suburb. As I've said before, I don't know what economic theorem it complies with—probably none—but what it does comply with is our sense of patriotism and national purpose. For that to happen, we must support them when things are tough. We must support them at times of drought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People on the land do not live with a widget factory. They do not have a predictable income stream. They live on one of the most vague income streams you can imagine. People on the land are so often driven to this not so much by economic principles but by an almost religious passion to be on the land, to earn their living from the land. We show our compassion to them at this point in time because, if you look deeply into exactly what they do, they do this: they live in one of the noblest of pursuits. Their job is to feed and clothe people. They don't exploit them through their weaknesses. They don't exploit them through addictions. They don't conjure up ways to swindle money out of people's pockets with things they don't need. They deliver back to humanity food and clothes. People who make it their lifetime pursuit to feed and clothe people are people who are the most deserving of our support in times of drought.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:58</span>):  Can I firstly acknowledge the member for New England, my predecessor as the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. In fact, a lot of the environment that we've put around the agriculture sector with respect to drought policy comes from his leadership. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Agricultural competitiveness white paper</span> also built that resilience and environment around our agriculture sector. It was ahead of its time. This parliament and this nation owe a lot of gratitude to member for New England.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, since coming into power, has invested over a billion dollars around drought assistance not only for farmers but also for small communities. It's not just the farmers that hurt during drought; it's the small businesses that support those farmers, those small communities. It's important that we acknowledge that and ensure that our policy settings not only support the resilience of our farming sector but also go to supporting those small regional communities. We've done that through a number of ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One is that we're about to pass some legislation to extend the farm household allowance to give dignity to those farmers who are doing it tough so that they will be able to put bread and butter on the table and put fuel in the car to take the kids to sport on the weekend. But we've also been able to ensure we have a concessional loan piece that now we'll be able to put through the Regional Investment Corporation. There is also the Drought Communities Program, which is putting $35 million into small regional communities to allow them to build projects that'll use local contractors. In any electorate of Maranoa I can assure you there are little communities like Quilpie and Cunnamulla that have been able to do new projects, such as for their racecourse, using local contractors and keeping them busy. The farm household allowance, that $538.80 a fortnight, also goes into the local supermarket, keeping employment in those communities alive and well during the tough times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also made sure that we have made an investment in controlling pests and weeds. In my own electorate in Queensland, we've put $13 million into wild-dog fencing. It has lifted the lambing rates from around seven per cent to 85 per cent. What that does is build resilience so that, when it does rain, our primary producers are able to take advantage of the commodity prices that are there because of the trade agreements we put in place. It also allows them to recover. We have also seen the environmental benefits of this dog fencing. We're seeing a large increase in small marsupials, brolgas and even koalas coming back because of the investment that we have made in partnership with the primary producer to ensure that we build resilience to get them through the drought and prepare them for the next drought but ensure that they take advantage of the great commodity prices that we've put in place. Our drought investment in regional communities and in farmers is not just about keeping them alive and going through a drought. It's going beyond that. It's looking towards building that resilience so that when it does rain they can take advantage and when they go through the next drought they're not as reliant on the Commonwealth. That is an important piece that we've put together. It's a strategic piece. The member for New England was at the fore of that and needs to be acknowledged for all his work on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some comments made in the speech by the member for Hunter when moving his amendments around particularly the intergovernmental agreement on drought with the states. Sadly, again, he was trying to score cheap political points without understanding the facts. It will not end on 1 July. In fact, AGMIN agreed that it will continue on. It will be finalised by September. But instead of mentioning that, the member for Hunter made a cheap political point, politicalising drought and hardship. It would be good if the member for Hunter got out of Newcastle and came and sat, as the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and I have done, at farmers' kitchen tables. He hasn't sat at a farmer's kitchen table in the last 12 months—I would put money on that—to listen to the reality and listen to the stories to be able to understand the policy settings that we are putting in place. That's what we as a government do. That's what the Prime Minister did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I challenge the Leader of the Opposition. Not one brass razoo did he commit to agriculture in his budget reply speech.</span>

                    </a>  Did he mention it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LITTLEPROUD:</span>
                    </a>  Only in passing did he mention it. He's made two significant national addresses. One was to the National Press Club. Not once did he use the word 'agriculture'. The Leader of the Opposition didn't even utter the word 'agriculture'. He wouldn't use the 'a' word. In passing, he talked about it, but he didn't commit even one extra dollar under an alternative government to agriculture. That's an indictment of those opposite. They don't understand agriculture and they don't care about agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are making sure that we are making those strategic investments. Those opposite come in here and talk about the Regional Investment Corporation and say it doesn't have a CEO and hasn't been set up. Well, the only reason the Regional Investment Corporation didn't come into effect was because of the sabotage of the Labor Party in not allowing it to get through the Senate. I blew their world away with my first parliamentary win in my first parliamentary week as the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. I was able to convince—</span>

                    </a>  Yes, it rocked your world. I was able to get the crossbenchers to change their minds and allow the Regional Investment Corporation to get through. That had Senator Wong and the member for Hunter scrambling all over the place, wondering who on the crossbench had changed their mind. We got it through. It's ready to start giving concessional loans. It's ready to roll on 1 July. Again we see the politicisation of trying to stop a piece of infrastructure—an investment in drought concessional loans. They're politicising drought and the hardship of these people. We are better than that. The member for Hunter is better than that—he is. He genuinely gets it. Unfortunately, he's decided to score cheap political points rather than come on the journey of trying to make a difference in those people's lives. In regional and rural Australia they're doing it tough at the moment. There's a way forward, and this parliament can find that. I know the member for Hunter can do that. The reality is that we are putting that framework in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The piece that I'm most excited about with what we are doing for farm household assistance is that we're not just handing out money every fortnight; we're allocating a case worker to each one of these people. So it's not just a handout—they'll sit down with them. We've invested an extra $20 million in rural financial counsellors: that's going to secure their services to 2020, and around $3½ million of that will go to increased services for demand. So we'll have someone that's going to sit around the kitchen table with people, get under the bonnet of their business and have the tough conversations. We've got to be honest. Some people are going to have to make some tough decisions about what their future is, but that needs to be done in a calm and decisive way. They need time, and by extending the farm household assistance by a year, we give them that time and we let them have those conversations with dignity and respect. They'll have those conversations with the experts. They'll sit down and have the conversation about whether they should continue or not. This is about making sure the right decisions are made with the right mindset.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we were out in western Queensland and western New South Wales, we also made an additional commitment of $2 million towards online psychological services. People in drought-affected areas are fatigued and hurting, particularly in parts of my electorate that have been drought-affected for up to seven years. They need some help and they need the help in an emotional sense. Being able to reach out, and having the ability to do it from the privacy of their own home, is important to them. It's important that we all agree—I know those opposite join me—that the stigma of mental health should never be such that someone would never ask for help. We live in a great country. This investment is about allowing people to reach out. I ask everybody, whether you're okay or not, to reach out to someone near you and ask whether they are okay. I have seen firsthand the emotional torment that some people are going through after seven years without an income—seven years without seeing what their blood, sweat and toil could become. It's heartbreaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we make those investments, not only in a financial sense but in an emotional sense. That's why what this government has done with respect to farm household assistance and other drought assistance packages is to make sure it's a whole measure—around emotional and financial support, and making sure we're investing in the resilience of regional and rural Australia and of our farmers. I'm proud to say that the farm household assistance will give our farmers that dignity, and the opportunity to reflect and to be able to work through the issues they need to work through to ensure they can make the right decisions for themselves, their families and their communities. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  Australia's Copyright Act originally dates right back to 1968. It was developed before man set foot on the moon, it was developed during the Vietnam War, it was developed during the Cold War, it was developed before the election of the great Gough Whitlam, it was developed before colour television, before digital, before the internet and before feminism. So, given that it's 50 years old, amendments to it to ensure that it keeps up to date with developments of the 21st century are welcome—amendments, of course, that are developed in close consultation with the stakeholders that are affected, that are inclusive and that respond to the needs of stakeholders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill extends the operation of the safe-harbour scheme set out in the Copyright Act 1968 to a broader range of service providers. The existing safe-harbour scheme protects carriage service providers, in particular internet service providers such as Telstra and Optus, from the civil liability they could otherwise be exposed to for hosting or communicating material that infringes copyright. To be able to rely on a legal safe harbour created by the Copyright Act, the carriage service provider needs to demonstrate that they operate a scheme for removing copyright-infringing material if they are notified of such material by a rights holder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has broad support across many stakeholder groups and it's consistent with Labor's longstanding position on the issue, as communicated to those stakeholders when we had consultations with them. It's generally supported by rights holders and their peak groups also, because it provides a social good without undermining the commercial interests of content creators or their capacity to negotiate effectively with commercial enterprises for the distribution of their copyright materials. As mentioned, there's been extensive consultation on this bill. There's been consultation through a Senate inquiry, through a series of round tables that were conducted by the Department of Communications and the Arts, and through a range of consultation papers on the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of what we are discussing today is the fact that we need to ensure that our legislation keeps up to date with the latest developments—that it keeps up to date with the 21st century. That's particularly the case with regard to copyright. One of my concerns—and I've expressed it many, many times in this parliament and elsewhere at conferences—is that I do not believe the government's work on critical infrastructure, particularly the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, is keeping up to date with the latest developments. When you look at what's happening overseas, particularly in the US, with the protection and cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, it becomes incredibly stark that the government is not serious about protecting our critical infrastructure. The government really does need to lift its game when it comes to critical infrastructure and the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has eight sectors that are deemed critical infrastructure—that is, eight sectors that are vitally important to Australia's social cohesion, its economic prosperity and its public safety. These are banking and finance, communication, energy, food and grocery, health, transport, water services, and Commonwealth government. If you compare that with what's happening overseas, we are very, very underdone in this area. In the United States, they've identified 16 sectors that are vital to their social cohesion, economic prosperity and public safety. In the United Kingdom, they've identified 13 sectors. In Canada, they've identified 10 sectors. In Singapore, they've identified 11 sectors. The sectors recognised by these nations but not currently included in the framework that governs our critical infrastructure include emergency services, information technology infrastructure, chemicals, manufacturing and, in the case of the US, electoral systems. Again, I've been pressing the government to start seriously thinking about including electoral systems in our critical infrastructure framework. We've seen what's happened overseas. We've seen what happened in the US. We've seen what happened in France. It is vitally important that we start taking this seriously not only in those eight sectors but also in expanding our sectors to include electoral systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are so behind in terms of what's happening internationally on critical infrastructure, and I do believe that the government are not focusing enough attention on this, as I've said many, many times. They're not focusing enough attention on getting those sectors updated and broadened, but they also have this spaghetti junction of infrastructure supporting critical infrastructure and also cybersecurity. We've got the Australian Cyber Security Centre looking after cybersecurity, we've got Home Affairs looking after cybersecurity and we've got a Critical Infrastructure Centre looking after critical infrastructure—but, when they were pressed on whether they could include a closer examination of cybersecurity in the context of critical infrastructure and also whether they could broaden out those critical infrastructure sectors, we were told at a conference last year that they're under-resourced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are, with a government that talks a good game on cybersecurity and comes up with all these dazzling strategies. There's a lot of activity, but the outcomes are very hard to see, particularly in terms of the consolidation of the management of cybersecurity in this country. It's a complete dog's breakfast. It is all over the place, and the government have not consolidated the management of it; they've actually fractured it by having some of it being managed in Home Affairs, some of it being managed in ACSC and some of it being managed in various other parts of government. Trying to get a sense of who's actually managing what in cybersecurity in Australia in 2018 is a very challenging exercise. This government, I fear, has just allowed cybersecurity to be dictated by the personalities of its ministers: 'Okay, I want a bit of that,' 'I want a bit of that,' and, 'I want a bit of that.' That is why it's spread throughout government agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That makes it very challenging when it comes to crises. We saw that with WannaCry. We saw that with NotPetya. In fact, we just celebrated—or not celebrated but went through—the anniversary of NotPetya, and the anniversary of WannaCry was about a month ago. When WannaCry hit, it was the Mother's Day weekend here. It hit the UK, and we were the next phase in terms of the time zone. And what happened here in Australia? I've taken up this point with the minister who had the responsibility for cybersecurity. In terms of communication, I woke up on Saturday morning and heard on the radio that WannaCry had hit. It had taken out the NHS in the UK. It had taken out companies throughout the world and had a significant impact on those private outfits as well as the NHS, the health system in the UK. And what happened? There was just a deafening silence from the government that Saturday when WannaCry hit. You turn on the radio. You hear about this. You think: 'Okay, what should I do? I'm a small business operating from home. What do I do to protect myself? What do I do to get a sense of what this means for me?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And there's nothing—just a deafening silence from the government. The cyber czar at the time was doing the occasional tweet and the occasional media interview, but in terms of a consolidated communication, a consolidated message, out to the broader Australian community, no-one knew what was going to happen. We'd seen what happened on EHS. We'd seen what had happened to these big multinationals right throughout the word, and here we are in Australia, hearing all this news, wondering, again, 'If it's my small business or my company, what do I do?' and there was nothing—there was nothing from the government. As I said, the cyber czar, Alastair MacGibbon, was out there doing a bit of a tweet and a few media interviews here in Canberra, but that was about the extent of it. I've made this point repeatedly, but the government is not listening. We have got to improve the way that we communicate about cybersecurity in this country and we also need to improve the mechanisms we have in the event there's a cyber threat right throughout the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, there is no crisis centre. At the moment, there is no one place to call. There is no one-stop shop for someone like a small business sitting here in Canberra, getting up, hearing that news on the Saturday morning and saying: 'What do I do? Where do I go?' There's nowhere to go. There are about five different sites you can go to. You can spend your morning trawling from one site to another. But even then the information that came out didn't really come out in terms of what people should be doing in terms of patching and backing up. It didn't come out till two days later, because everyone was off celebrating—and of course they would do that—with their mothers on Mother's Day. But this was potentially a crisis. No-one knew how this was going to play out in Australia. And the response by the government was underwhelming in the sense that there was really no response.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so again I encourage this government, I implore this government to start taking communication about cybersecurity seriously and to consolidate the communication so that a small business sitting in Canberra, on a Saturday morning, has one location, one point of truth to go to in the event that there is a cyber crisis—one point of truth, one message that is clear on telling me what I need to do, and when I need to do it by.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With WannaCry we heard about 18 individuals and companies that were affected here in Australia, but that's just what we know about in terms of the reporting. We don't know how badly this affected Australia. Most of those were small businesses. And where did they go for information on it? They went to about 10 different sites if they knew how to navigate their way around the labyrinth that is the cybersecurity governance that this government has set up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the critical infrastructure. I again implore the government to do something and start taking the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure seriously. As I said, we are way underdone in terms of the sectors covered in our framework, way underdone by international standards and also way underdone in terms of the cybersecurity management of that critical infrastructure. In the US each sector actually has a guiding council of experts from industry and from government. Say it's the electricity sector. They've got a guiding council of industry experts, government and peak associations who together work out the cybersecurity standards that need to be applied to the electricity sector. They work it out collectively, they come to an agreement, they look at international standards, they look at national standards and they work out what cybersecurity standards should be applied to, say, the electricity sector. We have none of that here. There's work being done on telecommunications, but that's it. We've still got those seven other sectors. As I said, we need to broaden those sectors as well if we are truly to keep up to date about what is happening internationally. There are 16 in the United States, 13 in the United Kingdom, 10 in Canada and 11 in Singapore. And the US also has it for electoral systems, which we should seriously be considering given what has happened internationally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of this copyright bill, amendments to ensure that legislation keeps up to date with the technology that is around, and keeps up to date with modern values, mores and developments, are vitally important. This is an iterative amendment. There has been consultation with a range of stakeholders, and we do need to ensure that copyright, particularly, keeps up to date with the latest technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I also implore the government to ensure that its treatment of critical infrastructure keeps up to date with the latest developments. I implore the government to start taking the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure seriously: start broadening out the sectors, start implementing some sort of framework for standards in critical infrastructure and drag the critical infrastructure management of this nation into the 21st century, in keeping with the Five Eyes community and other nations in our region.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I was going to say it is a pleasure speaking on the Copyright Amendment (Service Providers) Bill 2017, but it really isn't, because what we're talking about here is doing the easy part of reform in an area that really demands a lot more. The Minister for Communications has presented something that he knows—after 10 years of debate about what we do on safe harbours within copyright—has failed. In fact, we should probably name this bill not the Copyright Amendment (Service Providers) Bill but the 'copyright amendment (Fifield night sweats) bill', because the communications minister is so fearful of undertaking reform in this space and so unable to get agreement on the need for reform, which he knows needs to happen in this area, that all he'll do is promise another review, make a commitment for something to happen down the track and just hope that, when that point down the track arrives at the present day, he's nowhere near it. He's hoping that, by kicking the can for reform down the road, we can avoid all this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation does the right stuff. It promotes, obviously, the extension of safe harbours to educational institutions, libraries, archives, key cultural institutions and those organisations assisting persons with a disability. So it's all good stuff. Most of the entities I've just mentioned take a very conservative approach to ensure that there are copyright protections and that the right thing is done for rights holders. But it doesn't really go beyond that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that mean? What it means is that there are a whole stack of Australian firms in this area that are confronted by the spectre of costly litigation and have no comfort extended to them through this bill. It was promised the last time this thing was debated in this place that we'd have a review, and I spoke strongly in favour of local firms that have that legal threat hanging over them. We had the promise of another review, yet again, after all the reviews—I think there have been nearly a dozen different ones—that have occurred over 12 years. And this is the best we got.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole issue of current safe harbours was introduced in the Australian context in the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement in 2005. As the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities—who is the Minister representing the Minister for Communications in this place—rightly outlined, the scheme in the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement was intended to provide an alternative to court proceedings for copyright owners when infringing material is hosted, cached or linked by a service provider or where a provider's network services are used to infringe copyright. Even in that space of time, there has been massive change on the ground. Again, this was about providing an alternative to court proceedings for copyright owners, and I'll come back to this point. This was at a time when we did not see the emergence of cloud based platforms that are transforming the way we work right now—and not just what in we're talking about here but in a whole range of areas. This scheme is limited to service providers in a telco sense, but it does absolutely nothing in dealing with firms that are leveraging off cloud, are providing new services and, importantly, are providing incomes for a range of people. It brings them together and creates an income for them all and they are free from some concern that they will have infringed copyright in some way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rights holders keep screaming. The more extreme elements of them will always scream—although I do know there are people in the rights holder space who have recognised that times have moved on and that they need to have a much more nuanced and up-to-date view about how to manage this. This is the era of digital platforms. What used to be done in an analogue way is being replaced by digital platforms on a cloud based platform itself. This is changing the game, and we need to have some sort of protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some great firms here that are doing some important work in generating new income, be it for artists, manufacturers, printers or the like. They have no sense of comfort as a result of what the government has put forward today that they'll be looked after and that they will avoid the spectre of legal action against them. The one that I think of most, particularly on this day, is Redbubble. Redbubble's CEO, Martin Hosking, announced his retirement today after being with the firm since 2006. He has done some terrific work and should be celebrated for his contribution to the Australian economy. Redbubble is a platform that allows artists an alternative mechanism for income generation where they can team up with others. You can get something printed on a range of different material or media, so you're generating income not just for the artist but also others. It could be a printer in Perth, a textiles manufacturer in Melbourne and an artist in Adelaide all working and leveraging off a platform to create an income for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Redbubble was recently taken to court by Sony because it was claimed that Redbubble had, through their platform and through someone manipulating some artwork, infringed Sony's copyright of Pokemon. The judge that was ruling in the case declared in favour of Sony, of Pokemon. What was the cost? The cost of nominal damages to Redbubble was one dollar. The reason was that the judge found that Redbubble had been responsible for determining the content originated by artists through its processes, protocols and arrangements with artists. In finding indirect infringement, the judge found Redbubble had complete control over how its system operated and found that Redbubble 'had in place systems to monitor the steps taken by the users of the website' and 'could immediately have taken down or removed infringing material'. So Redbubble had been taking steps. The risk mitigation provided by Redbubble had been taken into consideration by the judge, which then provided for that nominal judgement to be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Redbubble made a submission to the bill as it was considered by the Senate. In January this year, they said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Safe harbours recognise the realities for Australian platforms that host user generated content and provide a fair and effective process for managing infringement on user generated content platforms … Safe harbour protection is critical for the fostering of innovation in the Australian technology sector … safe harbour would promote collaboration between all parties … in the fight against infringement; and … The limited safe harbour extension in the Bill applying only to the education sector and NFP sector will be impracticable to administer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They made all those points. It's worth noting that over 90 per cent of Redbubble's revenue—this Australian firm—is from customers outside Australia. An Australian firm provides a digital platform and is generating income where 90 per cent of the revenue is from outside Australia. Its website attracts over 20 million visitors per month. There are 10 million artworks and designs displayed on the website from over 600,000 artists. Artists have earned over $100 million from the site, with over 10 per cent of this going to Australian artists. The income they're earning is growing at around 50 per cent a year, a phenomenal growth rate. They're saying, 'If we have mechanisms in place to make sure we deal with copyright infringement quickly, and courts have looked at our process and, after considering what are argued infringements, issued nominal judgements of just a dollar because Redbubble has set itself up in that way, why do we still have the legal spectre hanging over us, the sword hanging over us?' It is because this bill doesn't provide protection for commercial activities that provide a platform for artists to get new forms of income along with a range of other businesses in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the extreme rights-holders argue, 'If Redbubble can't survive here, they can shove off and go overseas.' Is the 'jobs and growth' government going to allow this to happen? Redbubble and similar great Australian firms like Envato and 99designs—whose CEO, Patrick Llewelyn, shared a push-up competition with me in Oakland, California, but that's a story for another time—all could quite easily move offshore if we don't have a legal framework that allows businesses to operate here. People will say, 'They managed one legal challenge, they're fine; they'll just have to stump up to a court.' No, they should not have to face the prospect of funding legal challenges put to them by those who just want to run their businesses into the ground. There should be a legal framework here to protect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those extreme rights-holders who say basically that, if Redbubble have to shut up shop in Australia, they can rack off overseas—this is crazy. As I said before, in an era of digital platforms using the cloud to provide these services Redbubble would move overseas and still provide the same services that rights-holders get upset with, but it would mean the platform's whole stack of technology based jobs here gets snuffed out straightaway. If Redbubble moves, we lose an onshore economic opportunity all because of the extreme purity of the rights-holders that say, 'We will maintain existing arrangements; no changes, no ifs or buts'—which is just nuts. I cannot believe we're at that stage in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of those rights-holders say that I'm anti those copyright protections and want to stop artists, authors or whoever from earning income. That's rubbish. We need to find a sensible middle ground that doesn't just protect artists' income but gives them an opportunity to grow, so that they're not just reliant on grant schemes administered by government to survive but can find new avenues for income growth. Out of $100 million, 10 per cent is generated by Australian artists, with a growth rate of 50 per cent per year. That's huge. We have to not only protect Australian artists and find new incomes for them but also, if we are serious about promoting Australian innovation, provide an area with room to move for these firms to grow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That absolutely should be the case. No-one who says they are pro-innovation can be timid or quiet in this debate. If you're arguing that you're pro the smarts of Australian industry, that those jobs should be created here more and more and that you want digitally-skilled people to apply their skills to help firms grow, and you are timid, meek or quiet in this argument, you are anti innovation. You are anti the notion of diversifying our economic base through the emergence of new, smarter firms, because you didn't have the guts to stand up against the fevered exclamations of some extreme rights-holders in this debate and you couldn't find the middle ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to be pro artists and pro smarts in this debate. We've got to be pro smart firms that are providing opportunities for others to create an income. But, because the communications minister did not have the wit, the wherewithal or the courage in this debate to come up with an alternative way to extend safe harbour protections for great Australian firms, that's what we're missing out on. It's unacceptable, especially from those opposite, who harp on about jobs and growth like they have no other thought in their mind or no other argument that they can express. This should be completely different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have left, I would like to say thank you to Martin Hosking for the fact that he has followed through on his vision with his firm. He has capable people taking over from him and exceptionally talented people in that firm in Melbourne that I visited. Martin Hosking is exactly the type of person we should be patting on the back for opening up opportunities for young Australians and creative Australians here in this country. I hope that at some point when he looks back on the successes that he has been able to achieve in this space he'll be able to savour a legislative success that will enable other firms like his to grow and to thrive in this country instead of offshore.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  I rise to sum up debate on the Copyright Amendment (Service Providers) Bill 2017, which is another important step in reforming Australia's copyright law to better facilitate the delivery of fundamental and important digital services to Australians. I should make it clear that this bill is not about cybersecurity issues, so the contribution from the member for Canberra was rather mystifying. Nor is it particularly clear why the shadow Attorney-General said that Labor supports this legislation while the member for Chifley criticised this legislation. In effect, the member for Chifley was saying what the technology and innovation sector wants to hear and the shadow Attorney-General was telling rights holders, such as those in the music industry, what they want to hear. This is typical Labor—walking both sides of the street, divided and confused on what their policy is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does is extend the safe harbour scheme in the Copyright Act 1968 to institutions in the educational, cultural and disability sectors. The bill provides regulatory certainty for these institutions by setting out the steps they should take to prevent copyright infringements when they provide important digital services, such as internet access, directory services, hosting social media content or caching user services. It also ensures that these institutions receive protection from liability where these services are provided on the institution's behalf by a third party, such as a cloud service provider. Schools, universities, libraries, museums, archives and organisations assisting those with a disability will have a reduced risk of liability when individuals use their networks or services in a way that infringes copyright. These institutions will therefore have greater flexibility in the way they provide vital online services and support to Australians. For instance, the bill will help nearly 9,500 primary and secondary schools and 41 universities across Australia to more confidently provide digital services to 3½ million school students and over 1.3 million higher education students. It will assist just over 1,630 public libraries to provide essential services to millions of Australians with confidence.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the cooperation of the opposition and the crossbench in facilitating passage of this non-controversial bill. After nearly 15 years of debate on safe harbour reform, this bill represents the first attempt to push beyond the polarised views of stakeholders and will deliver much-needed and beneficial reform. I would like to thank all involved. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

I stand to mention this bill in particular, because whilst it only makes in one part small textual changes to ASIC's legislation, it should have extensive ramifications. This minor change actually should've been introduced back in 2016, but I think it would serve as no surprise, as with the conduct of most of the legislation we've dealt with recently in respect of financial services, that it has, indeed, taken around 18 months for this bill to be presented to this place. In fact, it's consistent with the lack of any prompt action at all by this government when it comes to financial services regulation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will mean that without limiting any of those existing elements, ASIC must also consider the effects its functions and the exercise of its powers have on competition across the financial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How did we get to here? Members may recall way back to the heady days of this government in 2013 when it established the Financial System Inquiry to hold a root and branch examination of Australia's financial system. Recommendation 30 of that inquiry asked that ASIC's mandate be updated to include consideration of competition. In particular, it read:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Review the state of competition in the sector every three years, improve reporting of how regulators balance competition against their core objectives, identify barriers to cross-border provision of financial services and include consideration of competition in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's mandate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2015, the government accepted recommendation 30 of the inquiry, a mere 10 months after the release of that report. The government told us, in their response to the inquiry, that it will help deliver a financial system that is resilient, efficient and fair. That was 2015. It is now the middle of 2018. We now have the bill—finally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will mean that without limiting the existing elements of ASIC's powers and responsibilities, it will also have to consider the effect of competition. It'll mean it will have to take into account whether any decisions that it takes will create a competitive advantage for some over others, or industries overall. It will have to evaluate whether a decision that will improve a consumer's ability to exert demand-based competitive pressure in a market would be compromised. This may impact on competition in the financial system and will enable ASIC to favour one option over another because of the effects of competition. For example, ASIC could consider whether a decision will create regulatory advantages for some companies over others competing in the same sector across the industry as a whole. In addition to this, it will be able to evaluate whether a decision made by it will disproportionately impact smaller entities. This is particularly relevant in the current environment, where we're considering the regulation of our banks, and in a context where we are seeing the banking royal commission undertake its work and likely make further recommendations for not only legislative change but also the way in which the regulators undertake their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met with a number of smaller players in the financial services sector during my time in this place, in particular, with reference to the work of the House economics committee. Because of what has unfolded in the Australian financial services sector, we have the big four banks and a large number of much smaller players. One of the issues that is often raised in this respect is that, when regulatory changes come into place, the capacity of smaller players to respond is much less and much more hampered. Whilst there is some consideration of this by APRA, there's no specific reference to this in the way in which ASIC undertakes its work. If we want to maintain a competitive financial services system where we don't see power—in particular, market power—aggregate to just a few, it is important that the way in which regulation will impact upon those smaller players is continually taken into account. We need to be aware of the capacity for work in small financial institutions as opposed to just the big four. ASIC will need to ensure that those small businesses and others are not negatively affected by industry-wide crackdowns. We need to see appropriate regulation across these sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will see this change to ASIC's objects and make sure that ASIC is able to, and does, consider the issue of competition. Earlier this year, the Productivity Commission's draft report recommended that ASIC or the ACCC be designated as the competition champion for the financial sector. Their final report is due next month. However, the change in the bill now will appear to fall short of designating either body as a financial services competition champion, because it will still see a situation where the ACCC, as the competition regulator, has some oversight of competition at a general level, including for financial services, but ASIC is at least able to consider this in its mandate and what it does. There are clear gaps that develop because of this split in the regulatory framework. Effectively, though, what we will see is that this change in ASIC's objects will align it in a similar way to what we already see with APRA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to APRA, we see that its act provides that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In performing and exercising its functions and powers, APRA is to balance the objectives of financial safety and efficiency, competition, contestability and competitive neutrality and, in balancing these objectives, is to promote financial system stability in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be interesting to see the extent to which the way in which competition is inserted into APRA's mandate—as opposed to the way in which it is being considered in ASIC's mandate—creates any difference. The changes in this bill are more modest, and simply require not that it be a function of ASIC but that it gives consideration to competition matters whilst performing its functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the aspects of having to now consider competition in the performance of its functions is that this bill contributes in an additional way to ASIC's remit. It effectively expands the things that ASIC has to do. Of course, this is at a time when ASIC already has more to do. Just this week we considered the legislation that is amending the fin-tech regulatory sandbox provisions that apply to ASIC, which means that there is work to do for ASIC in that space. We've recently considered updating legislation around crowdsourced equity funding, another area that ASIC has to control. Both of those are areas where ASIC needs to get up to speed, where it needs to increase its capability and where it needs to be able to provide services to the financial services sector. We also have the issue of initial coin offering—again, another situation where we see an intersection between ASIC and the ACCC—where some of these coin offerings may be regarded as financial products and some of them may be regarded merely as commodities. The issue being discussed between ASIC and the ACCC is how to best manage that so that we don't create regulatory gaps that put consumers at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of all those things, we have the ongoing Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. What that means, of course, is that as that unfolds—as there are recommendations that come forward from the royal commission and revelations as to the further misconduct that has occurred in this sector—it will undoubtedly create additional work that ASIC, as the corporate watchdog, must perform. But over the years this government has displayed a complete indifference to the impact of the financial sector misconduct on ordinary Australians. Every time that ASIC is given another job or there is an increase in its remit or, as we are yet to deal with, there is an increase in the penalties ASIC may seek or a broadening of the powers that it can utilise in the financial services sector, how does this government reward ASIC when we talk about capability review? In 2014, the way the government rewarded ASIC in this area was to cut its funding by $120 million. Soon after those cuts were made, ASIC declared that their work would be severely impacted by those cuts. The chair of the day told a parliamentary committee hearing that ASIC would be required to rely on misconduct reports and complaints rather than being able to conduct its own supervision, due to those financial cutbacks in the budget. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… our proactive surveillance will substantially reduce across the sectors we regulate and, in some cases, it will stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've definitely seen the impact of that in recent years. We've seen, as a result of those cuts, a severe decline in the supervision of banks and financial institutions, with little or no proactive surveillance being undertaken. The decline has been so dire that we have seen further creation of the environment that has led to the pressure on this government—pressure that it continually resisted for over 600 days—to establish the royal commission into banking, which has heard about the many lives across this country that have been turned upside down by our banking sector and financial service providers, with people's homes and livelihoods torn away as a result. As I've said, this government was dragged kicking and screaming to holding that royal commission, because it cared more about a protection racket of the banks than about making sure that victims were protected or that those entities like ASIC which are there to make sure that those people are protected were properly resourced to make sure that these sorts of things don't happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we can't forget about the way in which the coalition opposed the Labor government's Future of Financial Advice laws and their attempt to hollow out their application as soon as they came to government. The current Minister for Revenue and Financial Services told the parliament back in 2012 that FOFA would increase administrative burdens and compliance costs and consequently decrease productivity. In actual fact, FOFA legislation gave ASIC important tools to regulate financial advice in this country and to be able to protect consumers. ASIC knew that. ASIC have said that. But what was the government's response even when those laws remained in place? It cut the funding to ASIC so that nothing could be done about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amongst the critical aspects of FOFA which we have seen was the introduction of the best-interests test, a legal obligation on financial advisers to do the right thing by their customers—a novel approach, you would think. It also included the opt-in requirement so that financial advice clients would have to agree every two years to ongoing fee arrangements with their advisers. ASIC have told us that the requirements of FOFA, including this one, were essential to uncovering the massive fee-for-no-service scandal. This was a scandal in which big banks and others spent years charging clients for advice that they never provided. We've heard in the royal commission stories of clients being charged for no services. In fact, we've even heard that dying will not stop these entities from charging you a fee for doing literally nothing. In opposition, those now in government voted against FOFA. In government they tried to gut it—first by legislation, then by regulation and, of course, by defunding the entity that was responsible for enforcing it. Fortunately, Labor prevailed in the Senate, preventing the removal of those regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are more examples of this ilk. I'm sure many listening to me today will think: 'I've heard the member for Burt talk about these issues many times before. Why do we keep hearing about them again?' It's really an old ballad that we know well by now. It's the ballad of the government protecting its big bank buddies. I would like to point to another example of negligence by this government when it comes to financial services. Since 2016, this government has been promising to give ASIC important powers to crack down on dodgy payday-lending practices to help consumers and stop them from being ripped off. But to date this legislation still hasn't happened. In 2017, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services said the bill to implement these reforms would be introduced into the parliament at the earliest opportunity and that the reforms would pass that year. The sentiment was repeated by the Deputy Prime Minister last October. Well, 2017 came and went and the government had achieved diddly squat. In February, Treasury said they expected the legislation would be introduced in the autumn sittings. At the May budget estimates, Treasury officials, when pressed, told us that they couldn't provide an answer on when this vital legislation would be introduced, stating that it was 'a matter for government'. Yet here I stand, as we're about to go into the winter recess for 2018, and there is still no legislation in that area. I think what we are seeing is the bite-back on this government's agenda from the 'parliamentary friends of payday lending' sitting on the government backbench. They're almost as bad as the 'coalition backbench committee for power station nationalisation'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But all of this is the same trend from this government, where they talk a big talk and they have a big bark, but, when it comes to financial services regulation, they really have no bite. And when they did eventually get to introducing the legislation that is required, that was recommended to them by the Financial System Inquiry and that they said they would implement, it took them 18 months to drag the legislation into the chamber. Then, lo and behold, what do we find? They add this—on top of many other areas—to the expansion of ASIC's powers, but, at the same time, they are cutting funding—even in this budget just passed—to ASIC, the corporate regulator and the corporate watchdog. How on earth is this entity, which we rely on to protect consumers in the financial services sector in Australia, supposed to do its job when we all recognise it needs to do be able to do more? It needs more tools and it needs more powers. It needs to consider more things, as this bill proposes by making sure that ASIC has regard to competition. But how is it supposed to do that when the government says to ASIC, 'We're going to give you all these new powers so you can do things, but, at the same time, we're going to reduce the level of funding that we're providing to you'? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the royal commission, the Treasurer has said that this government wants to throw the book at these who have breached financial law and ripped off the victims of scandals in the financial services sector. I don't know which book he's going to throw, because there won't be any book left. The entity that is supposed to hold them to account, that is supposed to do that work, is being underfunded by this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to turn to the second aspect of this bill, and it is actually very important. It will remove the requirement for ASIC staff to be engaged under the Public Service Act. This, again, follows a recommendation from the ASIC capability review. This will bring ASIC into line with the other regulators in the financial services sector: APRA and the Reserve Bank. The 2015 ASIC capability review found that being subject to the Public Service Act negatively impacted on ASIC, in that it:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">increases the frequency with which ASIC must go to the market to advertise roles, increasing cost.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will point out that when they referred to impeding the ability for internal promotion, they seemed to take the view that it would be desirable for ASIC to have even more SES band employees within its ranks. When we talk about the capability of ASIC, I would have thought that having a few more legs on the ground—people doing the actual work at the front line of what we need ASIC to do—would be more desirable than creating an ever more top-heavy organisation with more senior executives. When it comes to employee attrition and employee advancement, that might have something to do with the fact that this government keeps cutting the funding to ASIC. How on earth would you expect any employees to hang around? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in any event, this bill provides for ASIC to employ directly rather than under the Public Service Act. It will allow certain functions, therefore, to also be delegated to ASIC senior staff members. This will actually improve flexibility within the agency, and that is an important thing. It will ensure that ASIC members who hold positions such as ASIC chairperson can delegate powers to other senior staff. It requires the ASIC chairperson to determine an ASIC code of conduct and ASIC values. These would come in to replace the code of conduct and values that currently apply under the Public Service Act. It will provide arrangements to transition ASIC staff engaged under the Public Service Act to be engaged directly under the ASIC Act. It's intended that all the changes will take place from 1 July 2019. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Community and Public Sector Union have raised concerns about the implementation of these changes, as well they should. The union are concerned that the application of the Australian Public Sector Commission's workplace bargaining policy may impact on future ASIC enterprise agreements. ASIC have advised that they will likely still have to bargain under the current framework for the next round of enterprise agreement negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue of concern, though, is superannuation entitlements. As you would imagine, there are a number of employees within ASIC who have transitioned into ASIC over a number of decades from its predecessor organisation and others, who are covered by transitional arrangements and historical arrangements when it comes to superannuation. ASIC have advised the CPSU that they have in-principle agreement from the finance minister that ASIC employees will retain and remain in their current super fund and superannuation arrangements. This is vitally important for these employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that ASIC will actually be able to attract and employ suitably qualified people and provide them with good career advancement opportunities. I can tell you from firsthand experience when I was prosecuting corporate crime and working closely with ASIC that ASIC is full of good, well-intentioned people. They do a very commendable job, given the limited resources that they are provided by this government. But we also need to make sure that ASIC is able to be filled with people who have a good understanding of the real world of business, of commerce, of the financial services sector—that they have an understanding of what happens in this sector on the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also need to guard against this becoming a revolving door of people moving from the banks and financial services sector into the regulator and then back out into more senior roles in the industry which they once regulated. This is a problem that also confronts other regulators, such as APRA. Where is the ground from which APRA can recruit? The banks. Where do the people who work at APRA go once they leave APRA? The banks. It's a bit of a revolving door, and that is a problem. Regardless of whether people are employed under the Public Service Act or newly under these amendments to the ASIC Act, we need to make sure that there is not an element of industry capture that confronts ASIC. At the same time, we need to balance that against ensuring that people within ASIC actually understand the sectors that they are seeking to regulate. The ability to promote from within them that will be granted is good in theory, but, as I say, we need to make sure that we don't create a top-heavy organisation—if all that is sought to be done here by creating these changes is to allow for an easier pathway into the more senior ranks of the organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All things considered, I think this will help ASIC to make sure that it's able to obtain the highly qualified people, the experienced individuals, whom it needs to do not just the senior managerial work but the work on the front line that ASIC needs to be able to do to make sure that it is an effective regulator, that it is able to make use of these new powers—the new considerations such as competition—that it will have. But I also hope that, in doing that, ASIC is not continually stifled by this government as it has been. It's one thing to say, 'Let's change the law to allow ASIC to pay its staff more and recruit and retain higher qualify staff,' but, if you're cutting the funding to that agency, how on earth is it going to do that? You give it the power and say, 'Go, flourish, blossom, employ all these great people, but we're not going to give you any money to do it.' That is the problem of this government. It is all bark and no bite. It likes a headline, but it never actually delivers on the things that it needs to when it comes to regulation in this country and protecting the vulnerable consumers of this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to just turn briefly to industry funding, because one of the things that we have been able to see with industry funding is that it has not matched up to what the government promised us here. When the government introduced its industry funding model for ASIC, it said that ASIC would be the tough cop on the beat. It said that industry funding would ensure that ASIC is able to deliver on the promise of protecting consumers, of making sure that we had a proper regulatory environment. It said that the industries that are consuming the most of ASIC's time and resources would have to pay for that work that ASIC was having to undertake to protect consumers and regulate those industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet we have a situation where ASIC has had to go cap in hand to government and say, 'We feel that we need to embed supervisors into our major banks, into the financial services sector.' And who's going to pay for that? Not industry, not the big banks—the taxpayers are going to have to pay for that. After government has cut the funding to ASIC, for each project ASIC has to go back, cap in hand, to government and say, 'We now want more money to do this.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole point of industry funding is that you give ASIC and other regulators the capability to say: 'We can see a problem. We need to chase that down. We need to be able to do that, and we can obtain the funding to do it because we're able to take that from the sector that we are regulating.' What we have seen here is a complete breakdown of what the promise of industry funding was. It's something the government needs to turn its mind to quite seriously because this legislation is important. It's legislation that we on this side of the House support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I also note that, when this government continually refuses to take steps to actually fund ASIC and the work it needs to perform, it's almost a complete waste of the time of this place. I think it is actually quite misleading to the public and confronting for the employees of ASIC when their concerns—when the concerns of the public, the concerns raised in review after review—are recognised and eventually, months or years later, this government gets around to introducing legislation to fix these issues, to say to ASIC, 'We'll give you more powers. We'll increase your capability. We'll give you regard to competition in the work that you do,' but they continually receive a lack of funding, funding cuts in the process and no regard for the fact we have a royal commission going on that is going to require even more work from ASIC as it concludes its work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while we support the bill, I note that it comes from a government that has repeatedly refused to take the necessary steps to actually protect ordinary Australians from the misconduct in the banking and financial services sector. Despite the name of the bill, I'm sorry to say that ASIC's capability will not in any way actually change in practice if this government over here doesn't deliver on the promises of the resources to allow ASIC to get on with the job it so crucially needs to perform in regulating our corporate sector, in regulating our markets, in looking after financial services and looking after community credit—all areas where this government really has a poor record. In some of the areas it hasn't even gotten around to bringing the legislation into this chamber, despite the fact that over a year ago it said it would deliver on it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, Labor supports this bill. It's actually vitally important that we get this right. But we do want to see that the government actually delivers on funding ASIC to make sure that ASIC can do the things that we in the place through legislation all say that it needs to do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing ASIC’s Capabilities) Bill 2018. There are two parts to the bill. Schedule 1 sees the inclusion of consideration of competition in ASIC's mandate. This comes from a number of reports, including the Financial System Inquiry some years ago. Schedule 2 amends the ASIC Act to allow the regulator to employ staff outside of the Public Service Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when it comes to ASIC, history has shown that Labor has a much better record of supporting our regulators to ensure that they are a tough cop on the beat and that they have the necessary resources to regulate and keep an eye on what's going on with financial services and banks in this country. When we're backing ASIC, we're really backing the protection of all consumers and not just looking after the top end of town. Compare and contrast this with what the Turnbull and Abbott governments have done when it comes to ASIC and our financial service regulators. They have been slow to make amends for their inaction, they've cut funding to ASIC and to the other regulators and only after Labor shone a spotlight on what was actually going on in the financial services industry and some of the rip-offs that were occurring did they reverse some of that funding cut. But they did not completely restore the amount of funding that was initially in the Labor budget before we left office. When the Abbott government initially cut funding, that resulted in a loss of people, a loss of personnel from the regulators that are tasked with the responsibility of looking at what is going on in banking and financial services, the area where we've had a large number of rip-offs and scandals. Just today and over the coming week we will see what's going on in the banking royal commission with the banks in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inclusion of a consideration of competition in ASIC's mandate, as required by this legislation, was originally supposed to be introduced by the end of 2016 as part of the government's response to the Financial System Inquiry. It's a relatively small but important change to the law, and yet it's taken the government a long time before this has been brought to the parliament, and that's no surprise. Historians will record this as yet another poor effort by this government to ensure that we have a strong and well-resourced financial regulator in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking at schedule 1 of the bill in more detail, including the consideration of the competition aspect of ASIC's mandate, the ASIC Act includes key objectives that ASIC needs to focus on when performing its functions and exercising its powers. These include promoting the confident and informed participation of investors and consumers in Australia's financial system. ASIC must maintain, facilitate and improve the performance of the financial system and the entities within that system. That is to help promote commercial certainty, to reduce business costs and to boost the efficiency and development of the national economy. Finally, as part of ASIC's mandate under the ASIC Act, the regulator is required to take whatever action it can take and is necessary in order to enforce and give effect to the laws of the Commonwealth that confer functions and powers upon it. If passed, this bill will mean that, without limiting these existing elements, ASIC must then also consider the effects that the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers will have on competition in the financial system. In action, this means that ASIC would need to take into account new considerations when making its decisions. This includes whether a decision will create a regulatory advantage for some companies over others competing in the same sector or generally across the industry as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIC would also need to consider if a decision will improve consumers' ability to exert demand-side competition pressure in a market. I think a good example of this in more recent times was a decision of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. They looked at strengthening the macroprudential standards that exist in lending, particularly around the housing market in Australia, and restrictions on interest-only loans to Australians. Going back to 2014, they introduced a set of new rules which initially imposed a growth limit of no more than 10 per cent on their interest-only loan book. That's been reformed to 30 per cent in more recent times. There's some disquiet amongst some of the smaller lenders in this particular market about that decision locking in market share for some of the bigger players and actually stifling competition within that market. The jury is still out on whether or not that has occurred and, depending on who you speak to, you'll get a different view. But this is an example of a particular decision by a regulator that potentially affects financial markets in Australia that ASIC may be required to look at under this new competition mandate, if it were required to do so by a government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, ASIC would also need to take into account whether a decision would disproportionately affect small entities and the impact that that would have on competition. Yet, given the existing objects of the ASIC Act, competition would not be considered in isolation. That's very important to point out. The regulator would consider competition in conjunction with elements of subsection 1(2) of the ASIC Act. For example, ASIC may still decide to proceed with an intervention that has a negative effect or impact on competition where the intervention is likely to significantly improve market confidence or investor participation. An example of that may be the case where a particular authorised deposit-taking institution was in trouble and looking like falling over and there was a takeover offer or an offer to merge with one of the existing ADIs. I'm reminded of the decision in recent times by Westpac to acquire St George. There have been other financial institution examples. Commonwealth Bank and Bankwest is another example. In the latter case, there was certainly evidence in the wake of the global financial crisis that Bankwest was in serious trouble. The decision was taken by the Commonwealth Bank to acquire that entity. It could be argued that that lessened competition within that market, but, in balancing that aspect of it, I dare say that there are reasonable grounds, in that you're facing the prospect of one of those financial institutions falling over and perhaps some of those who have deposits with that institution losing some or all of their deposits in the process. That's an example of where ASIC would have a competition mandate but that mandate would have to be read in accordance with the other mandate that it has, around stability in financial markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission's February 2018 draft report <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition in the Australian financial system</span> recommended that an existing regulator be designated as a competition champion for the financial sector. It proposed that either the ACCC or ASIC should be such a designated body. It should be noted that the change in this bill is relatively small; it simply requires ASIC to take competition into account amongst a number of other elements in performing its functions and exercising its powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill will remove the requirement for ASIC staff to be engaged under the Public Service Act 1999. This change will align ASIC with the prudential regulator, APRA, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. It implements a recommendation of the ASIC capability review. Labor encourages the government and ASIC to ensure that appropriate transitional arrangements are in place for existing staff. In that respect, the CPSU, the Public Service union, have mentioned to the government and the opposition that they have some concerns about this particular change, most notably the application of the APSC's workplace bargaining policy to future ASIC employees and enterprise agreements. ASIC have advised the CPSU that they will likely still have to bargain under the current framework for the next round of enterprise agreement negotiations and of course, importantly, superannuation entitlements. ASIC have advised the CPSU that they have in-principle agreement from the finance minister that ASIC employees will remain in their current super fund. However, the CPSU is seeking further information about the entitlement of future ASIC employees to access these funds. In seeking these answers, the opposition will make sure that we keep the government on its toes with respect to these important changes and that these commitments that have been given to the CPSU on behalf of their members who work at ASIC are met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this is a bill that delivers, finally, on some of the recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry in terms of the competition mandate and other inquiries relating to ASIC's capability and staff. But yet again we note that it comes in the wake of cuts that this government has made in the past to ASIC's budget that have resulted in reductions in the number of people with certain capabilities in these regulators having a look at what's been going on in financial services and banking in this country. We all now know that what has been uncovered in the royal commission—a royal commission that was opposed by this government for 600 days—has been quite shocking. We've seen the rip-offs and scandals that have occurred for Australians from all walks of life. We've heard from small businesses. We're seeing farmers this week railing against what the banks have done in rural and regional Australia and some of the decisions that have been made that have affected their livelihoods and their families. We've seen small businesses, households and individuals that have been the victims of financial fraud, rip-offs and scandals. For too long this government held out, did the bidding of the big banks and would not agree to a royal commission. It was only after Labor's persistence shone a light on what was actually going on in this industry that we finally got a royal commission. We welcome it, and we await both the interim report in September and the final report early next year. But we again say to the government that it's important that our financial system regulators be properly resourced to do their jobs. Although the government has—only partially—restored some of that funding, there is still a deficit in terms of the expertise that was lost over recent years because, in particular, of the 2014 Abbott budget and the effects that that had on financial service regulation in this country.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'DWYER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  Firstly, I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Strong and effective financial regulators go hand in hand with a strong and effective financial system. For this reason, since coming into power this government has commissioned two fundamental reviews: first, the Financial System Inquiry in 2013, which I note was not supported by those opposite but has been very valuable; and second, the capability review of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in 2015. Both of these reviews resulted in recommendations to strengthen ASIC—the corporate markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator. This bill implements recommendations from both of these reviews.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to mandate that ASIC consider the effects that the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers will have on competition in the financial system. Competition in the financial system is critical in ensuring that the system delivers good outcomes for Australia. Competition strongly disciplines businesses to lower costs associated with the delivery of products and services, engenders faster innovation and deployment of new technology, and delivers more choice and lower prices for consumers. The effects of stronger competition in the financial system are felt well beyond financial markets and into other parts of the economy. Increased competition can benefit the economy as a whole through improvements to productivity and economic growth. An explicit reference to take competition issues into account will empower ASIC to more consciously consider how its actions may impact upon competition in the financial system. This measure fulfils the government's commitment to implement recommendation 30 of the Financial System Inquiry. This recommendation stated that the government should include in ASIC's mandate a consideration of competition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill amends the ASIC Act to remove the requirement for ASIC to engage staff under the Public Service Act 1999. Consequential amendments are also made to the Business Names Registration Act 2011, Corporations Act 2001 and Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992. In order to be effective, ASIC needs to recruit staff with knowledge of financial markets and services. As opposed to other public sector agencies, ASIC is therefore often competing against the private sector when recruiting suitable staff. Removing the obligation for ASIC to engage staff under the Public Service Act means that ASIC will be able to compete more effectively for suitable staff. This measure will bring ASIC into line with other financial regulators, APRA and the RBA. Consistent with the findings of the Financial System Inquiry, recommendation 24 of the ASIC capability review report suggested that the government remove ASIC from the Public Service Act as a matter of priority to support effective recruitment and retention strategies. The government agreed with this recommendation and indicated that it would remove ASIC from the Public Service Act to support ASIC to more effectively recruit and retain staff in positions requiring specialist skills. This measure fulfils the government's commitment. ASIC staff who are APS employees immediately before the commencement of the bill on 1 July 2019 will maintain their continuity of service with ASIC but will cease to be employed under the PSA. They will be employed on the same terms and conditions and will maintain the same entitlements accrued under the ASIC Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill will strengthen ASIC's capabilities to ensure it is an effective regulator. It builds on other key initiatives undertaken by this government to ensure ASIC has the powers it needs to promote trust and confidence in the financial system. These initiatives include providing ASIC with a stronger funding base through implementing the industry funding model, undertaking a review to assess the suitability of the existing powers and regulatory tools available to ASIC, and appointing a new chairman to ASIC, James Shipton, who brings vast international experience to the role. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is always a good day when the coalition belatedly adopts Labor's policies. On 15 June 2016, Labor called on the government to raise the penalties for ripping off consumers. We did so following a succession of scandals in which firms had seen penalties for anticonsumer conduct as simply the cost of doing business. We had that period from 2011 to 2015 when Nurofen, one of the big shots in the pain business, began selling a series of painkillers said to target pain in the body—Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache—but the fact was they all had the same active ingredient, 342 milligrams of ibuprofen lysine. The fact was that Nurofen were misleading consumers, and the penalties dealt out to them were a mere slap on the wrist. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same was true when Dulux said that their outdoor paint could reduce the temperature of a house by 10 degrees and when Uncle Tobys asserted that its oats were a natural source of protein, leaving it to the fine print for consumers to understand that the oats are only a good source of protein when eaten with skim milk. More recently, we've seen the list of those who've been reprimanded by the competition watchdog read like a <span style="font-style:italic;">Who's Who</span> of the top end of town: Jetstar, Virgin, Arnott's, Optus, Harvey Norman franchisees, Kogan and Unilever. Earlier this year we had the Federal Court bring down a judgment against Flight Centre, finding that Flight Centre had asked a number of airlines not to publish on their websites ticket prices that were than Flight Centre's prices. That decision saw a penalty of $12½ million for conduct between 2005 and 2009. Indeed, Rod Sims, the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, has voiced concerns that penalties for anticonsumer and anticompetitive conduct in Australia are 'significantly lower' than the penalties in other OECD jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this bill is welcomed by this side of the House. This is a Labor policy being enacted into law. But the coalition need to go further. They need to amend the Competition and Consumer Act to give a fully autonomous market studies function to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and to explore public interest issues such as pricing discrepancies and increased market concentration. They need to increase the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's litigation budget so they can take on more potential scammers like those going door to door in Indigenous communities, ripping off some of the most disadvantaged people in Australia. They need to ramp up the penalties for anticompetitive conduct, which are lower in Australia than they are in comparable jurisdictions. Labor's policy on penalties for anticompetitive conduct says courts should use the European Union formula in the first instance, which makes the base penalty 30 per cent of the annual sales of the relevant product or service, multiplied by the number of years the infringement took place, capped at 10 per cent of annual turnover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, in Australia, fewer competitive markets than we need. By one estimate, in the research done by Adam Triggs and me, more than half of Australia's markets are concentrated, where concentration is defined as the big four having more than a third of the market. We need to see fewer monopolies and more competitive industries in Australia. Only Labor's policy will deliver that. Labor welcome this belated adoption of our policy, but it shouldn't have taken two years to get this point. Indeed, this bill has languished on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> since February. We should have had it dealt with by now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other measures include an 'egg-citing' measure about the definition of 'free range' which ensures that Australian customers know what 'free range' means when they see it on a label. We know many shoppers feel that suppliers are being a little chicken in telling them exactly what's going on. Having a precise definition of 'stocking density' will be good for consumers. Labor also supports the amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act to ensure that confidential supplier information obtained by the Australian Energy Regulator in performing its wholesale market monitoring and reporting functions under the National Electricity Law remains confidential under Commonwealth law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between the two parties when it comes to consumer and competition issues is stark. Labor would have acted on this issue of raising penalties more than two years ago. That was when we announced this Labor policy. Labor still believe that there is more to be done in making sure the penalties are right, that the regulator is appropriately resourced and that the regulator has the teeth to do those critical market studies. Labor will be supporting the bill, but we are doing so at a time when we know the government are going soft on payday lending because of their 'friends of payday lending' backbench group that is stopping them supporting a bill that has previously been backed by their own party room.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know they're not doing the right thing by independent mechanics, who are currently hitting the wall because they don't have access to the same data to fix cars that the authorised dealers have. We had the absurd situation on Monday of a private member's motion debate in which the coalition said they were already requiring manufacturers to share the same information with independent mechanics as they do with authorised dealers. That would be news to Australia's tens of thousands independent mechanics who right now suffer a competitive disadvantage by not getting the same data the authorised dealers get. As a consequence, consumers are paying higher prices and getting less choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have always been the party of consumers and competition. Labor continue to lead the consumer and competition debate, and we welcome the government, two years late, catching up on this important reform.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  While this is a relatively straightforward piece of legislation, it's an important one that the government supports and that all members in this House support. The Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 3) Bill deals with three specific schedules around laws directly affecting consumers which need to be properly addressed. Schedule 1 deals specifically with issues around consistency and making sure that the laws and penalty regimes that exist under consumer law are contemporary and reflect the modern reality. This is a very straightforward exercise, but it is actually critically important to do. Across this great nation every single day millions of consumers go about buying-and-selling behaviour to procure and consume goods and services to be able to support themselves, their families and their communities. People should not be taken advantage of. One of the foundational principles of a free and open market is that there be a sufficient amount of information available to make sure that consumers are informed about a product or a service if they're seeking to purchase it and that people are not misled and not taken advantage of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there is always a scenario where people may want to take advantage of consumers or other businesses that act as consumers, and that may be through providing deceptive conduct or engaging in some sort of fraud. Making sure that you have a penalty regime that's proportionate and reflects the reality of making sure that those who take advantage of consumers suffer the consequences is critically important, because over time—and this happens in other areas of law as well—if the penalty regime is not sufficient people may see the advantage in simply allowing for the breach of the law and paying the penalty. By having modern and consistent laws that work for 21st century consumers, particularly in an age of technology, people are able to buy things at a much faster rate and perhaps with less degree of scrutiny, so it's important to have this regime in place. This principle of support that underpins free and fair competition is something that this government should be proud of and proud to support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this piece of legislation directly deals with making sure that consumers, who are becoming increasingly mindful of their consumer behaviour, are protected under consumer law, particularly around making sure that, when they purchase something as straightforward as eggs, the eggs they buy are the eggs they get. In the Goldstein electorate, there happen to be lots of people who buy free-range eggs, including myself. Whether you're down at Bay Street Coles, Woolworths Bentley or, of course, one of the thousands of people every weekend that go to farmers' markets, like the one organised by the great people of Hampton Rotary in Sandringham or the one organised at Beaumaris North Primary School by Beaumaris Rotary in Beaumaris, when you buy eggs you want those eggs to be the ones you purchased. You also want to make sure that there are proper protections in place under law to make sure that if people are selling free-range eggs they are actually free-range eggs and that there are proper measures in place to work with business to be able to make sure that those people who sell these products are doing the right thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By making some relatively simple amendments around the safe-harbour provision, we're increasing the confidence and capacity of people to be able to provide the product. We know what happens when you increase supply, funnily enough: generally speaking, it should lead to lower prices, or at least more competitive prices. This makes sure that consumers get the benefit of that and do not experience deceptive or misleading conduct in the process of buying eggs. I know that across Goldstein, while it may not be at the front of everybody's mind around legislation, these are the sorts of simple things this government can do to make sure that consumers are better protected, to ensure that consumers, no matter where they are in our economy or society, get fair and equitable treatment and to provide certainty for businesses so that they can make investments and engage in providing products to the market to meet market demands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principle of the amendment around schedule 3 is related to the Australian Energy Regulator and the information it collects around confidentiality. What this provision predominantly does is provide consistency across the market and across legislation, and that's a fundamental good. It sits across a backdrop of an increasingly challenging energy environment across Australia, where information is more important than ever to be able to inform the market and to make sure that governments make sensible, measured, proportionate policy decisions to try to deliver reliability, security and cheaper prices for Australian consumers. It sits across a backdrop where government involvement in the market, as much as it is testing at times, is necessary. The framework and the design of the market is very important, particularly when you look at leadership policies like the National Energy Guarantee, which is going to be critical in delivering the three pillars of reliability, security and affordability. It is important that we have the information available to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A condition of people providing information is a sense of confidence. The information they provide, at times, may be market sensitive, and therefore requires a certain degree of confidentiality, and sometimes it's consumer sensitive as well. If you look at what this government is doing, the core focus of its agenda around energy is to deal with the problems with the legacy that we have inherited over decades through a mixture of policy incoherence and intransigence. The federal government has a direct responsibility for dealing with international commitments, environmental commitments and other policy commitments, particularly around the reduction of emissions. That directly affects the sectors that are principally responsible, which is predominantly the stationary energy sector. Of course, the states predominantly have responsibility for stationary energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have had is an incoherence, a lack of consistency and a misalignment between what the federal government has been doing and how the states have behaved in turn. That is what the National Energy Guarantee is focused on addressing. It's actually focused on making sure that, when the federal government acts, it's proportionate and is acting consistently with the states so that investors can have security and confidence about the money they're going to put down over long time horizons. They need to be able to invest in energy to deliver lower prices and supply the grid—and similarly for not just those in the wholesale business for supply but also, of course, those people investing in network infrastructure, all the way through to retailers. That's about giving consumers confidence and business the confidence that they need to be able to meet the increasing demands that this country expects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, energy consumption is critical not just to the energy demands of households—and we obviously regularly reflect on that, particularly household bills, because I know everybody is sensitive to that, including me and including the people of Goldstein—but also because there is a foundational input into the energy market for businesses to be competitive. Across the entire south-eastern corridor of Melbourne, we have businesses, particularly in areas around heavy manufacturing and the supply of components for industry, and also many other manufacturing businesses, who need that confidence in the energy market and affordable energy so they can be competitive on the world stage. That is not just the world stage for supplying to the global market. They can be suppliers and contributors to other parts of the market for other Australian businesses that then want to export into the global marketplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every little tweak in every little measure, including those introduced in the Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 3) Bill 2018, is a critical part of building the framework and the infrastructure to achieve that degree of certainty. The more information we have, the more we can make decisions about market design to make sure that we can deliver—for those households, for those struggling families, particularly those with the least flexibility, and, in addition to that, for those people and those businesses who help provide the foundations and the pillars for the growth of our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is because the coalition, and particularly the Liberal Party, believes in free markets. The Liberal Party foundationally believes in strong competition in the economy, driven by people who are doing the right thing to drive growth in the economy and provide the goods and services that people demand. Even something as technical as this piece of legislation is critical as part of that agenda. That's why it has been brought forward by the Turnbull coalition government as part of building this nation's future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I'm delighted to enter the debate about the Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 3) Bill 2018 and I want to thank the member for Fenner, in particular, for moving the amendment to the motion for the second reading, which was moved to highlight the fact that there are a number of issues where the government is not delivering on action for consumers. In my speech on the amendment today, I'm going to focus on a couple of key issues that are very important, I believe, for consumers not only in my home state but right across the country. They are two issues that I've been speaking on and championing for some time because I've seen the impact firsthand, and because I believe governments should take action, where appropriate, to protect consumers but also ensure that businesses and small businesses are protected. They, of course, are the issues of cracking down on payday lenders and of requiring car manufacturers to share technical information with independent mechanics on commercially fair and reasonable terms, with safeguards that enable environmental, safety- and security-related technical information to be shared with the independent sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken about these issues in this place. At every opportunity that I get to demonstrate my commitment to the protection of consumers and businesses, I will take that opportunity. In moving the second reading amendment, the member for Fenner made it very clear how this government has let down consumers and continues to do so on a daily basis. This includes the government's failure to commit to a full suite of measures to strengthen the consumer watchdog. On this side of the chamber, we welcome the adoption of our policy to increase penalties, which we announced over two years ago. But the government is still falling well short of community expectations for the protection of consumers, as I said, in many areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most notable of these is the absolute failure by the government to crack down on out-of-control payday loans. I now put on the record in the House of Representatives that it's now been 1,055 days since the government initiated the review of the payday loans industry in this country. Despite repeated promises made by the government, including by the now Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, that we would see action to clamp down on the payday loan sharks, we've yet to see any decisive action. It was only earlier this week that we heard on ABC Radio that we heard of the heartbreak and pain these shonky lenders are causing everyday Australians like Jane, a childcare worker who took out a payday loan to cover a few bills and has ended up with over $10,000 in debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted that the assistant minister who has responsibility for cracking down on payday loans has entered the chamber, because—</span>

                    </a>  He's just announced he is delighted to be here. Well, despite his sheer delight, it would be great if, rather than avoiding this issue, he could actually start siding with consumers rather than with payday loan sharks.</span>

                    </a>  Are you speaking on this bill? Which bill are you speaking on?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr DICK:</span>
                    </a>  I'm speaking to the amendment, if you could keep up. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I'll take the interjection. I know the assistant minister doesn't like turning up to the chamber, as we've found out. We now have an amendment which he is clearly not on top of and which, clearly, because it is about his responsibility, he is trying to avoid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of the assistant minister, who hasn't bothered to even read the amendment before the House of Representatives today, I'll remind him that over 650,000 Australians who've turned up and taken out payday loans are now faced with outrageous terms and conditions and interest rates of almost 900 per cent. I met with the Consumer Law Action Group this week and with other people who deal with this. They also asked for a meeting with the assistant minister, who is at the table, this week. His office told them he would be happy to meet, but he never followed up. That is a government that is out of touch and not listening to stakeholders. If the minister is true blue about listening to the stakeholders, he should meet with the people being affected by the loan sharks in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the cost of living has drastically risen under this government and that 1.8 million households are now financially distressed, which has resulted in 650,000 families turning to payday loans just to get by. I place on record again that these figures have almost doubled in the past decade. In return, consumers are paying interest rates as high as 884 per cent for household goods like fridges and washing machines, which would normally cost $350, but which end up costing consumers almost $4,000 because of loan sharks looking to rip off vulnerable Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, who actually led the charge on this and sadly has now been rolled by the hard Right of the Turnbull government and by the friends of payday lending inside the government. I know, from talking to welfare agencies and experts in the field who try to help people put their lives back together, that government can take action. They can take action. Do you know why, Mr Deputy Speaker? Because the government initiated a review. They've actually committed to legislation surrounding this. Instead, they've hidden it; they've kept it secret. They've just sat on their hands and done absolutely nothing. I remind the House that we did see that glimmer of hope but, unfortunately, the hard Right of the Liberal Party, perhaps in a factional spat, has now decided not to proceed with that. The minister and the new Deputy Prime Minister committed to real reform, but, as I've said, for 1,055 days the government has sat on this report and done absolutely nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In receiving the report and recommendations from their own review, the minister at the time was full of praise. I'll remind the House of memorable quotes such as, 'the government supported the vast majority of the recommendations, in part or in full'. And:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Implementation of these recommendations will ensure that vulnerable consumers are afforded appropriate levels of consumer protection while continuing to access SACCs and leases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's only this side of the House that has shown leadership when it comes to clamping down on payday lenders by introducing legislation earlier this year on 26 February. Sadly, not one coalition MP rose to support it. This is, in fact, despite the issue that the bill was the identical copy of the draft legislation released by the newly minted Deputy Prime Minister when he had responsibility for small business in 2017. The bill was approved by cabinet but later buried, as I said, as a result of pressure from the parliamentary friends of payday lenders. If these reforms were good enough for Minister McCormack and the coalition last year then they are surely good enough now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As recently as just last month, my office obtained a copy of the letter from the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, again, pledging that the legislation will be implemented this year. I won't be holding my breath, because after 1,055 days we've heard all of this before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the assistant minister who is responsible and is now in the chamber: start backing consumers and start listening to those people being ripped off by the loan sharks in this country. I've received countless examples—on it goes—of victims and of outrageous behaviour, that's the only word I can use. The government sides with the payday lenders rather than consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is just not serious when it comes to protecting Australian consumers from businesses who do the wrong thing by them. Under this government, the Turnbull government, penalties for engaging in anticompetitive conduct and for breaching the rights of consumers are simply inadequate. Penalties are too small to act as a deterrent, are low by international standards and are seen as a mere cost of doing business according to the Federal Court, the ACCC and legal experts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last five years we've seen a range of appalling contraventions of consumer rights, often targeting the most vulnerable members of our community. These include predatory consumer leasing agreements, breaches of product safety standards, scams and misleading advertising. The maximum penalty a corporation faces for breaching the ACL is $1.1 million. This is a very small amount relative to the annual revenue of large companies and is one-tenth of the size of the maximum penalty under the CCA's competition provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say very clearly on the record today: let's not forget it's the Labor Party who was the party of encouraging competition. Competition means lower prices, higher wages and better quality products for Australian families. It means a more productive and more innovative economy that has more jobs and a higher standard of living. Strengthening competition is about defeating vested interests. It is about promoting a fair and equal society, which, sadly, cannot be said for those opposite when it comes to giving people like Australian motorists a fair dinkum choice as to where and when they get their car serviced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, and I've spoken about this in the parliament this week, because more and more car and vehicle manufacturers are holding back information from local service centres, meaning higher costs for motorists and less choice as to where you can get your car serviced. Yet again, it has been left to Labor to show leadership in this space, particularly the member for Fenner, who has done a great job in advocating for our great policy, alongside Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition. Presently, car manufacturers generally own and control technical information and, in many cases, are the only sources of codes and software upgrades, which means that independent car repairers, who comprise the vast majority of Australian mechanics, are at a competitive disadvantage since most car manufacturers do not supply the same information to independent mechanics that they provide to authorised dealers. But I'm really pleased to support Labor's Your Car, Your Choice policy. We are seeking to change this to support the thousands of independent service mechanics right across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to the debate in the Federation Chamber on this exact matter earlier this week. Government speaker after government speaker started talking about roundtables into roundtables, committees into committees. 'Trust us. We'll get to it. We might do something on the never-never.' I know that, when I've spoken to mechanics at Sumner in my electorate, when I've taken the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition to sit down and listen to the mums and dads and small business operators in my community, they are sick and tired of the government not taking action. They want to see some action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear a lot from the LNP and the coalition government that they're the party of small business. Time and time again we hear these lectures. It's time now that the so-called party of small business started listening to small business, particularly the auto mechanics—people like Ian from Mr Spanner's and Scott from Future Auto Sumner Park. I know how much that would mean for their local businesses. Owners have told me that not only would it allow their local businesses to better service local residents but it would also be a huge win for our local economy as they could employ more mechanics and more apprentices to ply their trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this government sits by and does nothing. They weren't even able to defend their position in the Federation Chamber this week, as I already said. What we heard and continually hear is a lot of wishy-washy defence about how 'We're thinking about doing something about it down the track.' After consulting with industry, we know that this clearly isn't the case and we know that there is so-called consultation but only one-way consultation on this issue. We have heard that the government has a working party, yet I'm proud to say in the chamber today that the industry haven't heard anything about this. They've also apparently had a working party for some time, but that's also news to the industry, who said that's not their understanding but rather the government is meeting those who call them up. Let's call it what it is. That's not consultation; it's a joke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we know that this government, when it comes to consumer protection, simply cannot be trusted. When it comes to simple-yet-important changes that are needed to support local industry and local businesses, I call on the government to adopt Labor's Your Car, Your Choice policy of mandatory information sharing, which would mean a fairer playing field for all. Labor is committed to increasing the rights of consumers. We'll always stand by the consumers because Labor is on their side.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so I thank the former speaker. The Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 3) Bill 2018 delivers on a range of the measures that this government is undertaking in the consumer space because, as we saw sadly under the former government, we had very little action for six years and we are methodically working our way through. Schedule 1 to this bill delivers on our 2017-18 budget commitment to strengthen the Australian Consumer Law penalty regime to ensure that our Consumer Law continues to be an effective piece of legislation in the current economic environment. Schedule 1 increases the maximum civil pecuniary penalties and penalties for criminal offences for contraventions of the Australian Consumer Law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over time, as our economy continues to grow and thrive, the current penalty regime in the Australian Consumer Law has become outdated and insufficient to continue to deter breaches of the law. This ultimately puts consumers at risk of being victims of poor and non-compliant conduct, particularly where the conduct that breaches the law may be highly profitable or the company in breach is a large corporation. Schedule 1 to this bill increases the penalties in the Australian Consumer Law and sends a very clear and simple message to businesses: if you're considering engaging in conduct that would breach the Australian Consumer Law, think again, because the penalties will match the contravention. In the end, this government backs all Australian consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new maximum penalties for a body corporate include three possible penalty amounts, taking into account the benefit gained from the act or omission and the size of the business based on that body corporate's annual turnover. If the court can determine the value of the benefit obtained from the act or omission, then the new maximum penalty is the greater of $10 million or three times the value of the benefit obtained as a result of that act or omission. If the court can't determine the value of the benefit obtained from the act or omission, then the new maximum penalty is the greater of $10 million or 10 per cent of the annual turnover of the body corporate during that 12-month period—that is, the 12 months preceding, including the month in which the particular act or omission occurred or commenced occurring. The new maximum penalty for a person other than a body corporate is $500,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of this bill secures better protections for all Australian consumers. It provides a real deterrent to businesses considering engaging in noncompliant conduct. The increases to these maximum penalties will hold companies who breach the law accountable and will impose a real financial cost, instead just the cost of doing business. The amendments in schedule 1 have the support of all state and territory governments, who jointly enforce this law with the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Australian Consumer Law to insert a safe harbour from the misleading or deceptive conduct provisions for egg producers who comply with the Free Range Egg Labelling Information Standard. This will provide certainty for producers complying with the Free Range Egg Labelling Information Standard by ensuring that they won't be subject to prosecution under the misleading or deceptive conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law in relation to a claim that their eggs are free-range. By providing this certainty, the measure encourages industry adoption of the Free Range Egg Labelling Information Standard, which came into effect on 26 April this year following a 12-month transition period. The Free Range Egg Labelling Information Standard was developed following extensive consultation to provide producers and consumers with more clarity in relation to claims that eggs are free-range. The standard will give consumers and producers a very clear indication of the requirements that must be met when a producer makes a claim that their eggs are free-range. This means that, for the first time, consumers are able to be confident that eggs labelled as free-range were laid by hens with meaningful and regular access to the outdoors and the ability to roam and forage. The standard also makes sure consumers are getting what they pay for when choosing free-range eggs by requiring the disclosure of each producer's stocking density, as well as prescribing a maximum stocking density of 10,000 hens or fewer per hectare. This will now allow the consumer to select the free-range egg brand that meets their own personal preference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of this bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act to rectify an inconsistency between it and the National Electricity Law. This inconsistency between the National Electricity Law and the Competition and Consumer Act emerged in 2016 when the National Electricity Law was updated to provide the Australian Energy Regulator with new monitoring and reporting functions relating to the wholesale electricity market. The Australian Energy Regulator will use these functions to determine if there are features of the wholesale electricity market that undermine its effective functioning. As the Competition and Consumer Act is a Commonwealth law it currently takes precedence over the National Electricity Law. This bill will fix this inconsistency, which will ensure that confidential supplier information obtained by the Australian Energy Regulator in performing its wholesale market monitoring and reporting functions under the National Electricity Law remains confidential under the applicable Commonwealth law. This will ensures that our energy regulation regimes remain fair and efficient, and that the Australian Energy Regulator will continue to be a proactive and effective regulator.</span>

We might have varying views about how we can best grow and protect that industry, ensure its sustainable profitability, and create jobs and economic wealth in our regional communities, but we can agree on its critical importance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was just thinking that, in recent years, leaders of political parties both in government and in opposition have become a little bit more colourful in their approach to portfolio titles in the hope, I suppose, of putting forward a description which is of more interest to the constituents we try to win in that political contest. A recent example I can think of is 'Small and Family Business'. The Prime Minister was obviously hoping to better connect with that demographic by the description in the portfolio title. Some of them have become a little bit too long or a little too Orwellian, I have to say. But I think it's legitimate for a leader to choose how he might want to describe the work of his or her ministers in their areas of portfolio responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've often pondered whether 'agriculture' is the best descriptor of my own portfolio and the portfolio of the minister sitting at the table—I'm very pleased that he's here for my contribution. In fact, I've often wondered whether 'agriculture' is a sufficiently modern word for people to fully appreciate and whether 'food and fibre' might better reacquaint consumers with the product they're consuming and help to invoke more thought about where our food comes from and the important role our farmers play in food and fibre production.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think that, if you're really trying to capture in full the work of an agriculture minister, you would have 'biosecurity' in the title, because in my somewhat short experience as the minister—I keep saying it was 12 weeks—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FITZGIBBON:</span>
                  </a>  But the member for Blaxland is challenging me; I think it might have been 11. But it was a golden era in agriculture. I know we can all agree on that! In my lengthy experience, I found myself devoting a considerable amount of my time, if not the majority of my time, to dealing with biosecurity issues. It's very important. It goes to our productivity, it goes to our sustainable profitability and it goes to our reputation on both domestic and export markets. Our key competitive advantage, of course—I've said this many times; I feel I might be repeating myself a bit, but it is important—on export markets is our reputation as a provider of clean, green, high-quality, safe and ethically produced food. I'm pleased that the member for Blaxland is here. He understands this as the shadow minister and, I hope, soon the minister for trade: if we lose that reputation, we are in trouble. It is very difficult for us to compete with people who have other advantages in other areas, including a greater abundance of natural resources, greater proximity, more economies of scale or whatever it might be—lower costs in some circumstances. It's that reputation that allows us to keep on competing on international markets, and it's a reputation we must guard very closely. Of course, our biosecurity system and its integrity are absolutely critical to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we're considering today, the Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018, comes to us as a result of the Inspector-General of Biosecurity's review into the outbreak of white spot disease in the prawn sector. That was a very serious challenge to the government of the day and certainly a very serious challenge to the sector. It cost the sector dearly. I was critical of the minister at the time. I thought he moved on it too slowly and didn't do enough urgently, but that's in the past now. We are looking forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does a number of things, including, of course, providing the department with more power in certain areas to ensure that, whenever there are allegations of wrongdoing within the biosecurity area, the department has sufficient power to address them. In fact, the bill aims to implement greater information-gathering powers that will allow for faster and more accurate identification of 'at-risk' goods. These are very important. Some of the changes are minor in detail when they are read, but they will make a significant difference, in our view, to the capacity of the department to do its work and to enforce our biosecurity system. On that basis, the opposition will be supporting the bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition is very pleased that the bill is now in the House. For some reason, it seemed a little slow in arriving here after its introduction by the minister, but it is here. It reminds us of the importance of the Inspector-General of Biosecurity. The idea of having someone independent, at arm's length from the department, looking at these things in the way an ombudsman tends to do is of critical importance. Unfortunately, the House will recall that the former minister, the member for New England, decided to effectively abolish the Inspector-General of Biosecurity back in—I think—2015. Why he would want to do that is a mystery to me. But a greater mystery to me, as is always the case, is why his Prime Minister would give him that authorisation to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To reinforce that, I just want to share with the House what the Australian Veterinary Association said about that in the time. They said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If the Inspector-General's role is designed to be similar to that of an ombudsman (as described in the Beale Review)—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">and I will return to the Beale review—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">the public should be able to refer matters directly to the Inspector-General.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wonder where the minister of the day, the member for New England, was going to send those powers at the time, having gutted the inspector-general. Yes—I know what members are thinking—it was to himself. The member for New England was effectively going to be the Inspector-General of Biosecurity when he was the minister, until he was embarrassed, or otherwise, into that backdown, and that must have been a scary proposition for everyone working in the agriculture sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, in more recent times, he abolished another inspector-general—no, that was actually not in more recent times; it was in earlier times. He'd already abolished another inspector-general, and that was the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. We now know where that ended. It ended in tears. We saw a culture develop both in the department and in the industry as a result of the directions from the member for New England and as a result of the abolition of the inspector-general—and, of course, eventually, we saw the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> on our TV screens. I've said before that the live sheep trade might have had a future if we'd had an inspector-general for live animal exports from 2013 onwards and we hadn't had the member for New England create such a culture of risk taking in the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the member for New England: I noticed that today, in the farm household allowance debate, he suggested that members of the Labor Party hate farmers and—I think it was—hate coalminers. That is an offensive thing for the member for New England to say. The member for New England has no monopoly on care for farmers. I know the new minister would never say that. He knows better. But, of course, this is the modus operandi for the member for New England: create divisions in our communities and pick a side. When you're a member of the National Party, you only need three per cent to get to where you want to—</span>

You only need four per cent to get yourself into this place and, of course, to become Leader of the Nationals, you only need to corral—how many in your party room now? You only need to corral a dozen or so, and it will get you across the line! It's an interesting model they have. As a member of the LNP, you will appreciate this, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta. They come in here and they speak with conflict of interest on a daily basis. If I was a financial adviser and I was in here talking about a bill relevant to financial advisers, they would be screaming conflict of interest, but if I'm a farmer—a sheep producer, a cattle producer or a dairy farmer—and I come in here and I speak about farm bills, it's okay. I always say the worst agriculture ministers are farmers! We have a banker, and he—</span>

                  </a>  No, Barnaby claimed to have a few cattle! I once said, 'all hat and no cowboy', and someone said, 'No, the term in Australia is all hat and no cattle.' And I said I did that very deliberately, because I think Barnaby had three cattle running on the Tamworth property, so that would not have been accurate. I was very cautious in my approach to that claim.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But how dare the member for New England say members of the Labor Party don't care about farmers? You know the best thing you can do for farmers? I heard the minister say it this morning: take them with you, have the conversation, work with them and go together to the hard decisions. Go together to the hard decisions. And there are hard decisions to be made in the agriculture sector. Some of them will be around biosecurity. But what you don't do is create divisions in the community, including in the farming community, and then say, 'I'm just here for you,' as if the rest of us are not. In other words, those guys who are interested in reform to maintain and build sustainability and profitability? They're against you. They don't understand you. They don't like you. They don't sit around the kitchen table with you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that's not the minister's view and I appreciate and welcome that, but I do resent this charge from the member for New England that people in the Labor Party don't like farmers. It's a ridiculous thing to say, and he should come in here and apologise and retract. If he doesn't come in here and apologise and retract, that will say much more about him than his original statement. If I came in here and said members of the National Party or the Liberal Party hated shopkeepers, there would be hell to pay. The member for New England shouldn't be able to come in here and charge members of the Labor Party with hating farmers—or coalminers, for that matter—if for no other reason than that he knows it's untrue. He knows it's basically absolutely untrue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been talking for a long, long time about biosecurity and improving it because of its importance. We go back to the Beale review, a report commissioned by the then Labor government. Of course, the Beale review in many ways changed the way we look at biosecurity. And, of course, Beale recommended a change to the language as well at that time. He thought 'quarantine' conjured too much of the image of defence of the border, whereas the real task, of course, is very much defence beyond the border, making sure the trouble is nipped in the bud at its source. So we ended up with the term 'biosecurity'. I think it's a confusing term for some people—'quarantine' has been with us for a long time, and people know exactly what that means—but as time goes on people will come to understand the importance of the term 'biosecurity'. I think that word 'security' does highlight the importance of the work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over many years, we have further developed that work. As a result of the Beale review, we ended up with the Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity. This is very important because so much of the work in protecting our reputation is and will continue to be done by the states. The only way to do that effectively is to ensure we have ongoing agreement and cooperation with the states, including, of course, joint resourcing of the work that has to be done. This is one of the reasons I've been so critical.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't like to dwell on the member for New England—I feel like I'm sort of kicking someone while they're down—but he abolished the COAG process. His first act in government was to abolish the Standing Council on Primary Industries. This is the coordinating body for collaboration with the states. It's the body that should've been looking at drought policy over the last five years, but was unable to do so because it was abolished.</span>

                  </a>  I'm going to pick up on that. I predicted the minister would interject at that point, and he's right on cue. Let me tell you the difference, Mr Deputy Speaker. SCoPI was a formal creature of the COAG process, with the usual COAG resourcing and support. AGMIN is no such thing. In fact, the member for New England had no intention of having an AGMIN. When I challenged him on the abolition of SCoPI back in 2013, he said, 'We don't need that; we'll just do things on an ad hoc basis from time to time when we think there's something to discuss.' Then, I suspect, he probably got a call from the Prime Minister of the day, who would have said: 'I think we need to do a little bit better than that; these are pretty important issues—biosecurity et cetera. I think we can do better than that.' So he created AGMIN. That's short for agriculture ministers, of course.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have AGMIN, and AGMIN meets from time to time. I'm told the dinners which follow are very nice. I'm not going to ask questions about where they were held, but I'm told they are very nice. It has no real working agenda. There is no discipline. It's not like it's a quarterly meeting and officers who represent the department come back or their departments come back and say, 'Well, here's the thing.' SCoPI had a productivity agenda, a sustainability agenda and a profitability agenda—it had all sorts of ongoing work that was revisited each time SCoPI met. In the golden era of agriculture, when I was the minister, I had the good fortune of chairing SCoPI on one occasion, so I had a good insight into how SCoPI worked. AGMIN does none of those things. In fact, we don't know when AGMIN meets. The minister might tell me when AGMIN is meeting again.</span>

The whole idea of the intergovernmental agreement on drought, beyond the collaboration with the states, was to put new drought measures in place. I said yesterday, in another debate, that the states and the Commonwealth, with the support of the National Farmers' Federation and other farm leadership groups, agreed to start from scratch. The IGA was supposed to be reviewed over the five-year period, and now it's ready to be replaced. The minister has already extended that period. The minister has had long enough. They've had five years in government under the IGA. They've had long enough. Now he's kicked it down the road to December. Do you know what the significance of that is, Mr Deputy Speaker? It's very obvious: he's kicking it beyond the election. Just like live exports, he's kicking it beyond the election. The minister doesn't want to tackle the IGA and he doesn't want to tackle the hard issues; he wants to kick them all beyond the election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That review is compulsory reading. If someone wants a <span style="font-style:italic;">Reader's Digest </span>version of how biosecurity works in this country—where the flaws are and where the opportunities are—I recommend people in this place read that report. It's informative and they will find it interesting, believe it or not, because it does take you to interesting topics. It's a good review and I'm glad to hear that the minister is about to embrace it. It must be a very good thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another aspect to biosecurity, which is really relevant to this conversation, and it's somewhat of a repeat of the discussion we had yesterday but it's worthy of it. What is also important in biosecurity is how we manage our land and water resources. The great myth in this country is that we have an abundance of natural resources, or soil and water and, of course, nothing could be further from the truth. We have the driest inhabited continent on the earth and our soil resources are limited to a relatively small part of our continent. Some of them are very rich; some of them not so. We have farmers, as the climate continues to change, increasingly working what might be described as marginal land. The strength of our water resources, and how we manage and allocate them, is also critical to our biosecurity efforts. On that basis, we cannot just deal with the enforcement and regulation of biosecurity—making sure people aren't doing the wrong thing—we must do the work ourselves in other areas of policy, including natural resource management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a complex area of public policy. Agriculture is a challenging portfolio. I think it's fair to say that it's a portfolio that would not rate highly in this place as a portfolio that a majority of people understand well. I think if you took a scatter plot of the various portfolios and worked out where the strength of knowledge is, agriculture would not be in a high-priority plane on that scale. Why is that, given its importance to our national economy? I think it's because it's so complex. It's very complex and it's so diverse. You might argue that the agriculture portfolio is 20 portfolios if you took it commodity by commodity and added biosecurity, export arrangements and all that goes with it. It does make it almost intimidating for someone who's not working in the agriculture space all of the time. It has certainly been a magnificent learning curve for me in the five years I've been in the portfolio. It's been a very enjoyable experience and I've appreciated the opportunity to do this work. With a little bit of luck, I might have the opportunity to create another golden era in agriculture in the not too distant future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by foreshadowing something that I know my colleagues will talk about and that is the recent outbreak of fruit fly in Tasmania. This is a very, very serious issue. Tasmania is not without its challenges—distance being one of them. It is an island state, obviously, and it enjoys a clean green status, a safe status, that any country around the world would envy and, indeed, even those of us on the mainland would envy. Any challenge to that status is a very, very serious one for Tasmania, so dependent as it is on the agriculture sector, and horticulture in particular. What we don't want in the future are spats about who caused what and why the breakdown occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do want is a parliament working in a unified way in close cooperation with the Tasmanian government to make sure the right resources are being invested in the first place, and then, in turn, ensuring that any outbreak is treated with the urgency, determination and energy it deserves. It's a very serious issue for Tasmanians. I know other contributors will have more to say about it, but I want to tell Tasmanians, including my Tasmanian colleagues, that it's very much on my mind and we will do anything we can to work with governments—plural—to make sure those outbreaks don't occur again in the future. If, God forbid, they do, Tasmanians will have all the support of the people in this parliament to make sure that we address the problem as quickly and as urgently as possible. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, the opposition will be supporting the bill, and I look forward to this not being our last bill this week. I welcome the minister's intention to bring back the penalties bill for the live sheep trade, and look forward to that. That bill, of course, is one of the minister's key responses to the McCarthy review into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> and the wider issues in the live-export trade. We've made it clear that we don't see the bill having much effect, because history tells us that fines and penalties and other sanctions are rarely applied in the live sheep export trade. That's why we need an inspector-general for animal welfare and live animal exports. But we don't believe, of course, that increasing penalties can do any harm. Although I will say that, potentially, there's been a bit of a moral hazard in the past, in that the regulator has been reluctant to impose penalties that exist, because they may see them as being out of proportion to the crime. So, there's an argument that maybe the penalties have been too high and there's been a reluctance to impose them for that reason. That's only an anecdotal view, but it is entirely possible. But we like to think the bill can do no harm. We're prepared to support the bill, but I've done the right thing: I've foreshadowed my intention to move amendments which would immediately put a stop to the dreaded Northern Hemisphere summer trade and would phase out the live sheep trade over a five-year period.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:40</span>):  Don't come the raw prawn is part of the Australian lexicon, and now, thanks to the biosecurity shortcomings of this Liberal-National government, the raw prawn is also part of Australian legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Biosecurity is critical when it comes to protecting both our natural environment and the country's agricultural sector, but for too long this government has paid too much lip service to biosecurity. It's told the Australian public that it takes biosecurity seriously, but its actions have told a different story. For example, as the shadow minister outlined, the Inspector-General of Biosecurity is a crucial position, but the former minister of this government tried to axe it. Thankfully, that short-sighted idiocy was thwarted following outcry from this side of the House. As the shadow minister reminded us, perhaps it was because the former minister saw himself in the role of Inspector-General of Biosecurity—perhaps overexcited by his foray with Pistol and Boo, Johnny Depp's tiny dogs that he managed to have arrested. Perhaps that was his great vision and great dream, to arrest all the Pistols and Boos coming into the country! The importance of the role of the Inspector-General of Biosecurity is illustrated in the amendment before the House today, which follows in the wake of failings identified with the importation of raw prawns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February last year, the inspector-general commenced a review into the importation of raw prawns, and subsequently made 22 recommendations, 21 of which were accepted by the agriculture department. It just goes to show the importance of the post of the Inspector-General of Biosecurity. The report was handed down in December last year, and this amendment was slated for action early this year, but it's only now, halfway to 2019, that the Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 comes before the House. As I say, this government says it takes biosecurity seriously, but its actions tell another story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's biosecurity bodies have a range of responsibilities, and it is important that they are empowered and resourced to be able to perform their duties. Australia relies heavily upon imported goods, and the projected growth in the volume of goods and people entering our country means that now, more than ever before, we need a biosecurity system that is capable, effective and able to mitigate and manage threats. Every day, we live with the consequences of past biosecurity failures: rabbits, cane toads, feral cats and pigs, wild camels and brumbies, gorse, boxthorn—too many to mention. They have all, in their own ways, inflicted devastating impacts on the environment, native flora and fauna and our agricultural sector. Australia's native flora and fauna never evolved to deal with these threats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My state, Tasmania, understands all too well the risks posed by poorly resourced biosecurity systems unable to manage the threats of introduced species and pests. In Tasmania, we are now dealing with fruit fly, soft-shell clam, blueberry rust, Pacific oyster mortality syndrome and a whole host of other issues. Visitation to Tasmania from tourists and others is through the roof by both air and sea. That's good to see—we're getting a lot more people coming to Tasmania—but it also means a lot more people with potential biosecurity threats upon them, whether it's bringing fruit, flowers or whatever else it is with them. If they're coming by ferry, they might have these goods in their car. If they're coming by plane, they might be in a bag.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's therefore perplexing to me, given the high number of visitations that we get and the incredibly busy time that we have at our ports and our airports, that the state Liberal government in their first term cut $1 million from our state's biosecurity capability. At the very time they should have been putting on more officers and more sniffer dogs at the airports, the government were cutting the budget. I won't pretend to directly attribute the biosecurity budgeting failures of the current state Liberal government to the current incursion of fruit fly—that link cannot be directly drawn—but you've got to think that, if they hadn't cut the biosecurity budget, if they'd taken the issue just that little bit more seriously, if they'd followed through on their election promise to the people in 2014 that they were going to have biosecurity officers and sniffer dogs at every port of entry, maybe, just maybe, the fruit fly incursion that commenced in February this year would not have happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In February this year our state recorded its first ever outbreak of fruit fly, which led to quarantine zones being set up in the north of the state, including fruit-growing areas in my electorate. The stone fruit industry in Tasmania is worth $50 million a year. It is not an insignificant part of the agricultural sector. For many families, it's their livelihood. We're talking about multigenerational families involved in stone fruit production. Tasmania has got an enviable reputation for first-class, world-class, produce. All of that has been put at risk by the incursion of fruit fly. The consequences were immediate and brutal. Exports to Taiwan were halted. Fruit in quarantine zones could not be sold, except to local residents, who were unable to take it out of the area. Tasmania's $50 million stone fruit industry remains at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks, I'm pleased to say, there have been no more reports of fruit fly or their larvae emerging. I hope that we are lucky enough to have seen the end of it. I really do. I really do hope that the measures that have been put in place have got rid of this threat. But the fact is fruit flies are from Queensland and, like most Queenslanders, they don't like the cold. We are having a pretty cold winter in Tasmania, but there are fears that when the weather warms up the larvae will re-emerge. We've been lucky in Tasmania. We normally have very cold winters, so in the past if there had been an incursion any larvae would have died off over winter. They just would not survive the cold winter. But the winters are getting warmer. Those on the other side may argue about whether climate change is real or not. We know it's an established scientific fact that climate change is real. Tasmania is warming up. The winter soil is not as cold as it used to be. I truly hope that no fruit fly larvae have survived the winter, but there are fears. We'll see when the warmer weather kicks in again whether they are truly gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The incursion of fruit fly into Tasmania is evidence of what a slashed biosecurity budget can result in. Since fruit fly emerged, the state Liberal government has invested $5 million in combating it and the federal government has kicked in $20 million. I'm from Tasmania and it's great to see the funding, but it's typical action after the event. Rather than prevent the problem occurring, this is funding that has been put in place to try to address a crisis that need not have occurred. So it was very short-sighted not to have those measures in place already.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania's agricultural industry, which includes the export of fruit, makes up more than nine per cent of Tasmania's gross state product. It is a market and reputation that is heavily reliant upon pest-free status. I can't express enough how important Tasmania's reputation is for the value of our products overseas, whether they're fruit, meat, dairy, wine—it's increasingly wine; we're winning all sorts of world awards—gin or whisky, and the list goes on. We have a world-class reputation in Tasmania, and it relies on being seen as clean and green. When pests like fruit fly and others get in, it takes the edge off and makes overseas markets that used to look at Tasmania as a premium market think, 'Maybe we'll look somewhere else.' The last thing that we need in Tasmania is our customers looking elsewhere. We've already seen Taiwan suspend fruit imports, and other countries across Asia have expressed their concern about imports as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This region in the north makes up upwards of 75 per cent of Tasmania's fruit export market. The quarantine zone largely affects parts of Bass, the northern parts of my electorate of Lyons, and some of Braddon, which Justine Keay is seeking to represent again. Three-quarters of Tasmania's fruit export market is affected by this incursion. It's an ecological and biosecurity catastrophe and it will have dire consequences for our ability as a state to negotiate with existing and new markets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Justine Keay, as members will be aware, was the member for Braddon until she had to resign the seat, which she's now recontesting at the 28 July by-election. A measure of what a fantastic member she was for Braddon—and I hope she will become the member for Braddon again—is that she got on to this straight away. She was on this so quickly. In February, just days after the incursion, she was calling upon the state and federal Liberal governments to take this issue seriously. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Biosecurity staff do an amazing job but under the Liberals they have been stretched to breaking point … The Liberals are just not doing enough to respond to this unprecedented biosecurity threat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a stretch to say that without Justine Keay's immediate intervention on this issue getting it onto the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span> in the North West and making sure this was front and centre, this federal government—and certainly the state government in Tasmania—would not have taken this issue as seriously as they have. Justine Keay is a big part of why this issue has been taken so seriously in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That contrasts so vividly with the former member for Braddon, Brett Whiteley, who she replaced. He did nothing in the three years he was in this place. He did nothing about biosecurity. He was very happy to see all the cuts and to see no resources put into biosecurity. He did absolutely nothing to get on top of this issue. Perhaps Brett Whiteley was too busy voting six times against a banking royal commission to deal with biosecurity issues. That's the difference between those two people: Justine Keay was a fantastic representative for the people of Braddon and was looking after the interests of the people of Braddon; Brett Whiteley looked after the interests of the big banks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's fruit fly. Further down in my electorate, on the east coast near Orford, we've had a number of soft-shelled clams found in the Prosser River. They're not indigenous to Tasmania. Their discovery in this river is believed to be the first instance of these clams being found in the Southern Hemisphere. I'm not an ecologist, and I don't pretend to be an expert in this area, but I have to think that the warming of the waters plays a big part in this. It's not like government can just wave a magic wand and stop all this from occurring. We know that warmer waters are bringing introduced species south. We're seeing fish species off the east coast now that we've never seen before, which is great for fishers but also brings threats. Government's job is to make sure that biosecurity systems are resourced well enough to deal with threats when they emerge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some threats that should never get into the state. The fact that fruit fly was not stopped at the border, but was allowed to get in through the massive gaps in the biosecurity network, is one thing. It's not like we can have frogmen swimming through the waters of the Orford River and the Prosser River every day trying to catch these things, I understand that. But we should be on top of these things. We should make sure that we have the biosecurity systems in place to deal with these threats when they are found. I fear that neither this government nor the state government in Tasmania treats biosecurity with the importance that it deserves, particularly given the central role that agriculture has in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so vital that we look after making sure that biosecurity is protected. I just don't feel that's the case at the moment. There are soft-shell clams. There's blueberry rust. In late 2014 we had our first case of that. It's unlikely that we'll eradicate that now. I think the plan now is just to manage it, which is a great shame. There was a short window there, I think, where we could have gotten rid of blueberry rust, but it's just too well entrenched now. I think there's a general acceptance amongst most that the best method now is to manage that threat rather than seek to eradicate it. I'm very happy to support the bill, but I do think we need to take biosecurity incredibly seriously.</span>

                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I want to echo some of the comments that were made by the member for Lyons. I too was in northern Tasmania when the fruit fly outbreak occurred. I happened to be convening a round table with local farmers to talk about workforce planning just as the first outbreak occurred, and there was a lot of anger at the slow reaction that occurred from the state and federal governments on how to manage the issue. When managing biosecurity, we have to get better in this country at having a rapid response, making sure that we're on the ground. When we have outbreaks, when we have biosecurity threats, we should have a rapid response team that is able to collaboratively work with locals, work with industry and work with state and federal governments to stop them from spreading.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the slow reaction that occurred in northern Tasmania, many growers have lost a lot this season. Recently I was back there meeting with the same growers and just learning about the impact that the fruit fly outbreak had had on their businesses. Those who were inside the quarantine zone—whether they were tomato growers or they were strawberry growers, berry growers, cherry growers or apple growers—have all been affected. It's important to highlight, because it highlights that we always have to be vigilant about biosecurity and why we need to continue to make sure that biosecurity and legislation are front and centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I met with a tomato grower, he said that at one stage, until they had a facility established in the area, his product had to go to Melbourne to be fumigated to come back to be sold in local markets. It took months for a local facility to be established so that the fumigation process did not have to occur in Melbourne. The cost involved in that is just extraordinary. Yes, that grower was able to recoup some of that cost through the package that was established jointly by the state and federal governments. However, we could have avoided the extra cost involved, which cost the taxpayers, if we had just had the facility on the ground and established sooner. This is a grower whose tomatoes we all know. He grows hydroponic tomatoes, and you can buy them from Coles all year round. He is an innovative grower who knows his obligations in regard to biosecurity and has some practical steps that we could adopt in this place to ensure we have better biosecurity measures, particularly in northern Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's not the only one who has been affected by the fruit fly crisis in northern Tasmania. With Justine Keay, who is working hard in the area, I also met a cherry grower-producer who had literally packed his cherries—they were on their way to China. China heard about the outbreak and just said, 'No more cherries from that region of Tasmania.' He was able to get a second buyer, but the value dropped. His box of cherries went from $21 per box down to $9. That's a huge cut for a grower to cop. That's a huge cut, and that is a huge loss. That turned that crop from a crop that would yield good profits for the grower to just breaking even. That is something that that particular grower will never be able to make back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, they're now asking questions about what will happen next year. As we know, it's winter now in Tasmania, but there's a fear that this winter will not be cold enough to kill off the fruit fly. The clock on days free before detecting fruit fly hasn't even started. And now we have strawberry growers and berry growers in northern Tasmania debating whether or not to plant next year's strawberries and proceed with next year's crop because of the fact that the clock on the fruit fly biosecurity threat has not started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know the source of the fruit fly outbreak, after months of investigation into where it came from. Sadly, it came from my home state of Victoria, where fruit fly continues to be an ongoing biosecurity problem. Growers in my part of the world have told me how particularly bad it is this year. There are lots of local solutions on how our communities and our growers wish to combat such pests and biosecurity threats as fruit fly, yet they struggle to get any kind of engagement at a federal level. Locally, in parts of central Victoria, there are growers who are trying to work with local government, local communities and local constituents on managing their own trees. You may have a grower who is on board and doing everything they can with their crop. But, right next door, you may have three or four households who have a couple of fruit trees and don't know how to manage, because they haven't been engaged or educated or provided with the tools they need to combat fruit fly, and then the problem is exacerbated. This is an opportunity for us, and this is where the government is letting the agricultural sector down. There isn't enough forward planning or investment in and empowerment of communities in fruit-growing districts to combat issues such as fruit fly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018, is supported by Labor because it strengthens Australia's biosecurity system through a number of measures. It proposes new information gathering under chapter 6 of the act, which will deal with some of the issues that I've raised—monitoring, controlling and responding to biosecurity risks within Australia. However, I believe we need to go much further. The bill proposes enabling instruments under the act to incorporate publicly available information as amended from time to time. This will go towards helping the situation that I outlined at the beginning of my contribution; however, I believe we also need to match that with funding and having a triage system in place so local communities can engage quickly with what they need to do to combat the problem. The situation we had in northern Tasmania earlier this year and late last year was crazy. There was no coordination to tackle the crisis. Signs went up saying, 'Drop your fruit before crossing this street,' but there were no bins. People coming across on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Spirit of Tasmania </span>could buy a Victorian apple on the ferry, but there was nobody taking the apple off them if they hadn't eaten it by the time they got off. There was a real drop in biosecurity. We should all learn from the fruit fly experience in Tasmania and commit to never letting it happen again in other parts of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not the only biosecurity risk we've had in this country under the government's watch. We know of the problem we've had with imported prawns and how that has spread the white spot disease to local prawns, devastating local prawn industries. Again, it's something that could've been avoided. The government has taken over 12 months to put this bill forward, and in that time we've seen the suspension of imported uncooked prawns and the closure of several prawn farms on the Logan River in Queensland because of the outbreak I just referred to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 February 2017, the Inspector-General of Biosecurity undertook a review of this issue and has suggested a way forward, making 22 recommendations in the report. The government has accepted 21 of 22, in full or in principle. The one recommendation that was noted was the adequate funding of biosecurity resources. I can't believe that the government kind of squibbed on one of the most critical, fundamental, ongoing, continuing and long-term funding measures for biosecurity resources to empower communities, businesses and industries to tackle these outbreaks when they occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to biosecurity, we need to come from the premise where it will happen. It will happen in our country at some stage and it's how we react to it. It's our readiness to react to the biosecurity outbreaks when they occur, so we have the triage system in place to manage the biosecurity risk when it breaks out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill aims to improve and implement greater information gathering powers and will allow fast, and more accurate, identification of risk. However, where we need to go further is ensuring, once the risk is identified, that there is funding to ensure that we act quickly. Biosecurity in our country, if we are serious about our clean, green image of our agricultural product, needs to be front and centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that consumers are increasingly asking the question, whether it be the berries that they're buying and consuming or whether it be the seafood that they're eating, 'is their food is safe?' It's not just in the prawn and in the fruit industry where we have issues in relation to biosecurity. It was not that long ago that we had a biosecurity problem and threat in the pork industry when some cheeky importers were trying to import ham that was off the bone, and the bone, into Australia, and then trying to put them back together and sell them as ham on the bone. I know it sounds ridiculous and why would somebody try and do it? But there was that threat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That put jobs in my part of the world at risk at Don KR Castlemaine, who is the biggest private employer in central Victoria. Because of biosecurity reasons in Australia, you can only buy ham that is on the bone—so your Christmas ham, or the hams you buy in the delis—from Australian pork. That's important for the pork industry. It's also important for biosecurity reasons. It is to do with way back when a disease occurred within pork, within the bone. It was only through quick reaction of the then Labor government, and the minister at the time—the member for Watson—that that issue was dealt with quickly and that practice of bringing in ham, or pork, and the bone, and putting it back together was stopped. It's an example of why we need to move quickly and swiftly when we're tackling issues of biosecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is great that we've now got this legislation before us; however, it doesn't go far enough. We need to match the legislation with funding. We need to match the legislation with a proactive and robust commitment, through COAG, of the states and federal governments working together. We need to encourage our states to work collaboratively together to deal with biosecurity risks quickly and take responsibility. I do believe the state government of Victoria needs to take more responsibility for what happened in Tasmania. With proper consultation, and with proper leadership from federal government, there could be a way that Tassie and Victoria could work together, not just on issues like fruit fly but on all issues in relation to biosecurity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  The Biosecurity Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 will help in our continuous fight to manage biosecurity risks and further strengthen Australia's already enviable biosecurity status. Our enviable pest and disease free status provides a key competitive advantage for our agricultural exports and must be supported by the combined efforts of governments, industry and the community. Our biosecurity system also plays a key role in protecting our environment and biodiversity from the devastating impacts of exotic pests and diseases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to face new challenges driven by the increasing volume and complexity of international trade and travel. It is important that we all recognise our shared responsibility and contribute to managing the biosecurity risk we create and the benefits we enjoy. We are continually bringing about incremental and real improvements to our risk management arrangements. In this vein, the coalition government has delivered up to $200 million over four years to strengthen Australia's biosecurity system through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agricultural Competitiveness white paper</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> stronger farmers stronger economy</span>, on top of an additional $100 million to fight pests and weeds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have continued our investment. The 2018-19 budget included an additional $121.6 million for biosecurity as an initial down payment on our commitment to strengthening the national biosecurity system in response to the recommendations of the independent review. The additional funding will support trade and help us to detect, identify and respond to exotic pests and diseases earlier to keep our clean, green image. These increases are locked in for the future. The new ASL in funding is there to support funding for biosecurity on an ongoing basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is committed to ensuring biosecurity continues to be adequately resourced and that all risk creators and beneficiaries equitably contribute to our shared challenge. It is not fair to expect farmers and everyday Australians to pay for managing biosecurity risk that is created by others. There is no shortage of evidence of the considerable costs associated with allowing pests to spread and establish. To address this issue and in response to one of the key recommendations of the independent review, the government is introducing a biosecurity imports levy on imports by sea starting from 1 July 2019. The levy will raise an estimated $325 million over the forward estimates, which will both sustain and bolster investment in the national biosecurity system to boost our ability to respond to biosecurity risk and threats, streamline processing and reduce regulatory burdens. The bill amends the Biosecurity Act 2015 to address difficulties experienced in collecting information about goods that may pose a biosecurity risk after they have entered the country by providing information gathering powers that allow for faster and more accurate identification of at-risk goods. These powers will enable the Director of Biosecurity or the Director of Human Biosecurity to issue a general requirement for persons in possession of goods such as uncooked prawns that have been released from biosecurity control to provide to the relevant director information about the goods, such as their current location.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having this information would then enable a secure direction to be issued regarding the goods, which can prevent their further movement and will support targeted operational responses to control biosecurity risks. It also addresses recommendation 2 of the Senate committee reporting on biosecurity risks associated with imported seafood, including uncooked prawns. When used with existing powers in the Biosecurity Act, the new information-gathering powers contribute to a more robust biosecurity system. The bill also enhances our ability to update alternative import conditions quickly and easily in response to changes in biosecurity risk and includes other minor changes that will make the act easier to administer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Agricultural industries are a large contributor to the Australian economy, and it is essential to protect them, our export markets, our unique environment, our health and our way of life by keeping Australia free of exotic pests and disease. This bill is another demonstration of the Australian government's continuing commitment to maintaining and improving the biosecurity system to enable us to manage these threats. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  The purpose of the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Productivity Commission Response Part 1 and Other Measures) Bill 2018 is to make a number of changes to Australia's intellectual property laws. Most of the changes in the bill, as the title suggests, are based on the recommendations of the Productivity Commission in its inquiry report <span style="font-style:italic;">Intellectual property arrangements</span>, which was published in December last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a recent report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on this bill which clearly outlines the findings and recommendations of the Productivity Commission for reform of our intellectual property laws. Those findings and recommendations include the following. Australia's IP arrangements fall short in many ways, and improvement is needed across the spectrum of IP rights. IP arrangements need to ensure that creators and inventors are rewarded for their efforts. Australia's patent system grants exclusivity too readily, allowing a proliferation of low-quality patents, frustrating follow-on innovators and stymieing competition. Copyright is broader in scope and longer in duration than needed, and innovative firms, universities and schools and consumers bear the cost. Timely and cost-effective access to copyright content is the best way to reduce infringement. Commercial transactions involving IP rights should be subject to competition law. While Australia's enforcement system works relatively well, reform is needed to improve access, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The absence of an overarching objective, policy framework and reform champion has contributed to Australia losing its way on IP policy. International commitments substantially constrain Australia's IP policy flexibility. Reform efforts have more often than not succumbed to misinformation and scare campaigns. Steely resolve will be needed to pursue better balanced IP arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that is the kind of finding and recommendation that we've come to expect from the rigorous work that's done by the Productivity Commission, and I have to say that Labor is very happy to participate in ongoing reform of our IP laws. Labor has long advocated that there should be an ongoing process of review of the law in all areas of Commonwealth responsibility and that reform should be undertaken when change is required. With the rapid changes that are being brought about by ongoing technological change, this need for ongoing law reform is particularly important in the area of intellectual property law. Intellectual property law is an area that I practised in from time to time in the 20 years that I practised as a barrister.</span>

                    </a>  Unnecessary information, it's been suggested by the minister opposite. But it simply means that I have more of a particular personal interest in the subject matter of this bill than, perhaps, some other members. I can say in a heartfelt way that we are pleased to support the changes being brought forward by the government in this bill, the purpose of which is to make improvements to Australia's intellectual property laws to ensure that they better meet the objectives of promoting and incentivising investment in creativity, innovation, research and technology. To this end, this bill amends the following federal acts: the Copyright Act 1968, the Designs Act 2003, the Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987, the Patents Act 1990, the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 and the Trade Marks Act 1995.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some comments on the plant breeder's rights amendments. Plant breeder's rights is an area of intellectual property law that has developed, to some extent, separately from other parts of patent law. The reforms in this bill are likely to bring the plant breeder's rights part of intellectual property law more into line with other IP rights, and that's important. It's important that both practitioners and users of all parts of the intellectual property system should find it as easy as possible to understand. The more that all of it can be brought into alignment, the better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Plant breeder's rights has, perhaps, grown up separately, because it deals with somewhat different subject matter to other parts of intellectual property law, but it's been made clear, through the Productivity Commission report and through the inquiry that's been conducted by the Economics Legislation Committee, that the current plant breeder's rights legislation does not provide adequate protections to farmers and other small businesses. That was the comment made by the Economics Legislation Committee in its report. It's the case that farmers and other small businesses that benefit from the ability to obtain rights through the plant breeder's rights system are—as are other rights holders in other areas of intellectual property law—vulnerable to unjustified threats and infringement proceedings. One of the consequences of the government going through an exposure draft process for this bill and going through an inquiry by the Economics Legislation Committee is that it has been possible to determine that there is wide support for the proposed amendments. In the form in which they're being introduced, what they will do is introduce some capacity for rights holders—for farmers and other small businesses who develop unique varieties of plants—to obtain protection from unjustified threats of infringement and to obtain additional or exemplary damages in situations of flagrant or wilful infringement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, what these amendments deal with is providing protection of registered varieties to EDVs—essentially derived varieties. They are varieties which share all of the characteristics of a registered plant variety, but are distinct and qualify for a plant breeders right's registration in their own right. These amendments, as I say, will provide more protection to farmers and small businesses that rely on the plant breeder's rights scheme to protect their intellectual property, and, as with the other changes to the other acts that I've mentioned, these are useful amendments to the intellectual property system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports these changes. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee noted in one of the final paragraphs of its report, paragraph 2.62:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee notes that key parts of the bill originate from recommendations made by independent reviews, and that the provisions of the bill have been subject to extensive consultation. In particular, the committee commends IP Australia for its thoughtful response to the public consultation on the exposure draft of the bill which ultimately led to provisions of the bill being altered in important aspects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill as making balanced and reasonable reform to intellectual property law. As always, we will continue to consult with stakeholders on whether further changes to intellectual property laws are needed to ensure that they continue to be fit for purpose. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I rise to support the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Productivity Commission Response Part 1 and Other Measures) Bill 2018. While some members in this House may not find intellectual property fascinating, I can say with absolute confidence that I find it to be an incredibly interesting and incredibly fascinating area of public policy. Anyone who understands the economy—I accept there are some members opposite who do not—understands the power and the role of property rights as the foundation of markets and tradeable goods and services. And, of course, property rights sit at the heart of an innovative economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly, intellectual property rights sit at the heart of an innovative economy, because if you don't have some form of property right that sits at the heart of an innovation you cannot trade it, you cannot sell it, you have no sense of ownership, you have no incentive to invest and you do not have the advantage or the opportunity to be able to trade it and for other people to learn of it. One of the great tests of intellectual property is to make sure that innovations and inventions are disclosed so that you can inform the market. It acts as an incentive for other people to be able to learn from the knowledge that other people have invested in so that we can continue not only economic progress, technological progress and social progress, but, ultimately, human progress. While this bill only seeks to amend components of intellectual property laws, it's nonetheless very important, following a long inquiry by the Productivity Commission, as part of the need to make sure that our intellectual property regime keeps pace with the changing nature of the Australian economy and the global landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the amendments included in this piece of legislation is directly related to parallel imports. Parallel imports, as some members may be aware, come up from time to time when people import products that have trademarks applied to them. I've just seen Mr Gosling walk into the House, wearing an interesting outfit, to say the least! Clothing is not protected by intellectual property, just so you know. Fashion is not a subject matter, so you'll not be able to claim exclusive rights! But with parallel importation of goods that are trademark protected, having simple, measured, proportionate reforms to parallel import restrictions is incredibly important, because people should be able to import goods into this country and have their property rights respected even if they do not originate in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few years ago, I was involved heavily in the debate around parallel importation of copyrighted books, up until the point that the Rudd government, frankly, squibbed it, after it was bought off by the arguments of, unfortunately, a small number of people who argued defensively not in the interests of intellectual property, despite the deception that was advocated, but in the interests of people who wanted to protect their industry. It had no impact on culture; that was a great lie put out there by the Australian Labor Party, among a number of other political parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With, for instance, copyrighted books, you have two types of property: you have the physical property, which is the pages, the binding and those sorts of things, and then the words, the copyrighted component. What parallel import restrictions did on books was protect the physical part of the book but not the intellectual property component of the book. It was a great deception imposed on this country, which led to people continuing to pay more for books, meaning fewer opportunities for children to learn and fewer opportunities to be able to secure the benefits of education and broaden the knowledge base of the nation, just to protect the interests of commercial operators. It is a shameful chapter in this nation's history, as far as I'm concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parallel importation should make sure that royalties are paid to the people who hold the IP. That is resolutely the case. What this amendment seeks to do is respect the IP and respect the royalty payments that are deserved, but not protect the interests of—well, these days, the modern Labor Party prefer to refer to them as the top end of town. That was the objective of parallel import restrictions under the models that they preferred in the past. So, this is a good reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the reforms around plant breeder's rights, as an anomaly, are a consequence of how the intention of the system is designed to work to encourage people to create derivatives directly associated with the innovation and crossbreeding of plant varieties. That's incredibly important, particularly in a nation like ours, with so many unique flowers and plants that are part of our nation and the natural bounty of our Commonwealth. We should be encouraging the value and the extraction of the value of each one of those natural embodiments and endowments. We also have to make sure that we properly reward those people who invest in this type of invention and this type of innovation to the welfare and the benefit of humanity. That's what IP regimes are designed and set up to do. But, when you have an anomaly, where people who don't register certain plant varieties, and, therefore, don't get certain types of—it can undermine the protection of others, and is a disincentive to investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

It was on this day 40 years ago, two score years ago, that the Northern Territory got limited self-government. Territory Day is an opportunity for us Territorians to celebrate everything we love about the Territory: the relaxed lifestyle, open and friendly people, stunning sunsets, markets, waterfalls—it's all there in the Far North. The music and the sartorial tastes have changed somewhat since 1978—the year the Bee Gees and Meat Loaf were the top of the charts, and Territory politicians were given permission to wear safari suits during sittings—but the essence of what makes the Territory so special has remained. It's the resilience of a town that was flattened in the bombings during World War Two, and by Cyclone Tracy, but was rebuilt to become the amazing modern and tropical city it is today. In the lead-up to Territory Day we Territorians have a message for the Commonwealth. In the words of Meat Loaf:</span>

From August this year, residents in south-east Melbourne will have access to a first-of-its-kind drug-and-alcohol treatment centre. The treatment centre is part of an Australian government National Ice Action Strategy funding package for drug-and-alcohol addiction services across South-East Melbourne, including Frankston and Mornington in my own electorate. The 16-week intensive drug and alcohol rehabilitation program is open to adults. This format includes individual and group sessions as well. The treatment program in Frankston will be run by Peninsula Health. This will be the first of its kind in Victoria. Family, friends and health professionals will be able to call the intake number during business hours for information and to be referred to the drug-and-alcohol treatment program. This program will be fantastic for my electorate because my constituents will receive access to the services they need to get better. This resource is supported by initial funding of $1.5 million from the federal government, with further funding to follow. I have been fighting for additional resources for treatment and rehabilitation since my election, and I'm very proud to deliver on this commitment for my electorate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Today I rise in the House of Representatives to place on record and pay tribute to one of the most dedicated, loyal and hardworking people I know. Cathy Maree Bidgood—or CMB, as I've known her for the more than 10 years in which she has worked with and for me—will be retiring in the coming weeks and moving into the next chapter of her life. Together with her husband, Bruce, Cathy will now be able to spend more time relaxing, with trips to her beloved Macleay Island in Moreton Bay and perhaps even an occasional glass of good red. Whether it be rain, hail or shine, Cathy has been there for me and thousands of local residents: helping, advocating for and supporting some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our Oxley community; and at every election handing out 'how to vote' cards, organising booth captains and being an true friend with undying support. I am delighted that Cathy is here in the chamber today. From the bottom of my heart I'm truly grateful for everything you've done for me and our local community over so many years. Cath, you will be missed by many community groups and the hundreds of locals whom you've helped and who call you a friend. I, and on behalf of all my staff, wish you all the very best for many happy years ahead. You deserve a well-earned retirement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  The Australian Electoral Commission recently announced the results of the redistribution of federal divisions in the state of Victoria. This will see changes to the electorate of Murray. There will be a change of name as well as geographical boundaries. The name will no longer be Murray; it is set to become Nicholls. The change of the division of Murray to Nicholls is to honour Sir Douglas Nicholls and also Lady Gladys Nicholls for their significant contribution to advocating for Aboriginal rights and welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Douglas Nicholls was a professional athlete, a VFL footballer with Fitzroy, a pastor and the inaugural Chairman of the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation. He was involved in organisations such as the Australian Aborigines' League and the Victorian Aborigines Advancement League. Sir Nicholls became Governor of South Australia in 1976 and the first Aboriginal person to hold vice-regal office. Lady Gladys Nicholls co-founded the women's auxiliary of the AAL as well as holding many other positions. She was also leading in the advancement of Aboriginal rights, especially Aboriginal women's rights.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this redistribution, I'm also going to lose part of my electorate. Places such as Wedderburn, Boort, Pyramid Hill and Bridgewater, in the Loddon shire, will be joining Mallee, and towns such as Euroa and Violet Town, in the Strathbogie shire, will be joining Indi. But I do look forward to picking up the towns of Seymour, Tallarook, Broadford and Puckapunyal to join me. Hopefully, I will get the opportunity to stand for Nicholls.</span>

                  </a>(<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise to speak about the very important issue of penalty rate cuts. We have heard a lot about how they will have devastating impacts on the household budgets of some of the lowest income earners in this country. But I would like to talk about how they are, in fact, compensation—fair compensation for working unsociable hours. People who work on weekends and evenings miss valuable time with their families. They miss time with their children. They miss spending time with their friends, just having fun and getting a work-life balance. Those on the other side say there is no such thing as a 24/7 society, but nearly 90 per cent of the workforce still work Monday to Friday. People who work on weekends serving us while we're having fun deserve compensation, and that compensation should be universal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other side say that emergency workers don't deserve penalty rate cuts. Who is to say that a nurse's time with her family and her children is any more important than a retail worker's time with her family and her children? That is an absolute nonsense. It does not make sense. We know that this is the thin edge of the wedge. We know that hairdressers are now in line for penalty rate cuts. We know that some providers in the health sector have tried to cut penalty rates for nurses on the back of these cuts. We know that it is only time before this spreads like a scourge, a disease, right across industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To say penalty rates destroy jobs is nonsense. We know that, in retail and hospitality, jobs actually grew, as did profits in that sector, under the old penalty rates regime. Even the Fair Work Commission has said it will have little or no impact on jobs. The government needs to back Labor on protecting penalty rates and it needs to back— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It will be a very important visit for me. Last year, when I visited the island to catch up with local leaders, I was struck by the worn beauty of one particular building, the All Saints Anglican Church, which is heritage listed. The building represents a significant period in Torres Strait heritage when Christianity was brought to the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The London Missionary Society arrived in the Torres Strait on the vessel HMS <span style="font-style:italic;">Surprise</span>, led by two Englishmen, the Reverends MacFarlane and Murray. They landed on Erub on 1 July 1871. This was the first contact between islanders and missionaries, which came to be known as the 'coming of the light'. The All Saints church was built in 1919, using locally produced lime from burnt coral and basalt, under the directions of an Erub Islander by the name of Manai and a South Sea Islander named Albert Ware.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, however, the building has slowly declined from erosion, a lack of funds for ongoing renovations and maintenance work, and a shortage of local skill sets. The congregation numbers have dropped with additional churches in the community. Over the past year I've been working closely with My Pathway, which runs Community Development Program activities for Erub, to ensure that the church is restored to its former glory in time for the centenary anniversary in February next year. The project is one of more than just restoration. It means so much spiritually to the island's residents.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  The Prime Minister has been talking a lot about aspiration this week, but what about the older Australians in my community who have worked hard all their lives and now aspire to the age pension that they deserve? Some in my community have been aspiring to the age pension for seven months. The government admits to a delay of 49 days, but seven months is a lot longer than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris in my electorate applied for the pension in December, but when he contacted my office last week it had still not been processed. The issue, he was told, was that he had not provided details of his wife's business, yet he had sent the paperwork off multiple times. Fortunately, my office was able to intervene and the claim was processed. But Chris said that if it weren't for growing his own vegetables, he has no idea how he would have survived.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Denise and Steven applied for their pensions in early November, and I'm appalled that they are still not processed. There's no question they're eligible. Their claims were approved back in May. The problem is that after seven months, when they were finally approved, an extremely large back pay amount had accrued, and Steven has been told it's too large for the system to process. So they aren't being paid at all, and the amount they are owed is increasing. This is appalling and shows the insurmountable battle Centrelink staff are facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know Centrelink is understaffed and under-resourced, and staff are working overtime. Yet this government continues to cut jobs from Centrelink—another 1,280 this year—with no regard for the Australians waiting for youth allowance, carer's payments and the age pension. It's not good enough, and this government must act now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Last week I joined colleagues in a roundtable with the Australia India Business Council. We talked about bringing our nations of Australia and India closer together through trade, education, culture and friendship based on shared values, and we discussed the New Colombo Plan, which is giving thousands of undergraduate students around Australia, including over 100 so far in Brisbane, the opportunity to study and intern in countries around our Indo-Pacific region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the Brisbane students I've met, Alexandra Alder, will be interning at a Singapore based NGO later this year, and some other Brisbane students, such as Sarah Sheppard and Michael Reynolds, are interning at private companies and learning the languages of business partners around the Pacific. These students are also researching at some of the most advanced universities in our region. So the New Colombo Plan is giving upcoming Australian leaders both cultural and business experience, key skills and, most of all, personal friendships and connections around our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give one quick example. John Lin came to Brisbane from Taiwan when he was a student, and he fell in love with our city, naturally. Last month, I joined John at the opening of his family's new W Hotel, an exciting new billion-dollar five-star hotel offering in Brisbane. That shows the power of personal connections in our region and the potential value of programs like the New Colombo Plan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Hells Gate dam was proposed by Dr Bradfield, the greatest builder in Australian history—known for Sydney Harbour Bridge, Story Bridge in Brisbane and the underground railway system, for which he won the international prize for engineering. His water supply dams are still the major source of water for the city of Sydney to this very day. In 1929 he proposed the Bradfield scheme, stage 1 of which was Hells Gate dam. This dam, which has had $3 million from the Labor government to upgrade the figures—we thank them—and $3 million from the Liberal government to upgrade the figures—we thank them—will provide $2.5 billion in income each and every year, forever, for the Australian economy. It will create 20,000 jobs in the highest unemployment area by far and away in Australia, the Townsville-Mackay region. An adequate and cheap water supply is desperately needed for Townsville, for all of North Queensland's baseload electricity and for beef production. North Queensland's much-needed and long overdue lot feeding will enable us to process in North Queensland instead of sending cattle south and then having to send the beef north. The dam will provide massive timber production. Its major function is to provide ethanol and biodiesel. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australia has a fine track record of producing successful gymnasts. We on the Northern Beaches are very fortunate to have a large and enthusiastic gymnastics community, supported by the Manly Warringah Gymnastics Club at Cromer, the New South Wales Gymnastics Club of the Year in 2013 and 2014. The club has served our community for over 30 years, and in that time it has had over 10,000 members. Currently, over 2,000 children and young adults attend every week.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  This week's ACCC report on the state of private health insurance found that Australians were paying an extra $1 billion in premiums in the years between 2015-16 and 2016-17. Dissatisfaction has also soared, with complaints increasing by a phenomenal 30 per cent, and exclusions continue their relentless rise. Meanwhile, figures released earlier this year show that insurers' profits continue to grow. So private health insurance costs have blown out by almost 30 per cent under the Liberals, with families now paying $1,000 more every year than they did back in 2013. It's little wonder that Australians are dropping their private health insurance coverage in droves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this, the Turnbull government is refusing to do anything meaningful to address this looming crisis. While this out-of-touch government will do anything to protect the profits of multinational insurers, Labor will shift the balance back in favour of consumers. We will cap private health insurance premiums at two per cent for two years, saving families an average of $340 a year, and task the Productivity Commission with a thorough review of this issue, focusing on the value, quality and affordability of private health insurance. We're also asking Australians to share their opinions on how we can shape a better, more affordable, effective system. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  This week I was pleased to announce a $1 million accelerating commercialisation grant for Tingalpa business Loadpro Australia. This grant will help Loadpro commercialise their state-of-the-art X60 mine haulage truck. Loadpro founder and managing director Ron Schlieb says that this grant will help them complete the final design of the X60 and commercialise it, achieving domestic sales and laying the foundation for global sales. This will be great for the local economy, creating exporting revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The X60 is a fantastic truck design. Its features include high payload with low gross weight along with less fuel burn. It fills a product gap for off-highway trucks in the mining and construction industries, in particular for extended hauls that other off-highway and articulated trucks aren't suited for. Ron says the funded project will lead to a commercialisation production run. This will meet expected advance orders for the X60 in Australia and Indonesia from companies with already-established relationships with Loadpro.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This announcement follows another accelerated commercialisation grant provided to a Lytton company in my electorate last month. Advanced Robotic Technology received funding to develop a structural steel processing system. This system has the potential to help Australian firms better compete with cheap imported fabricators. ART director David White said the grant will help cover the costs of bringing the system to market.</span>

That will impact on a possible 17,000 people in my community. It is a direct, arbitrary cut to their wages with no negotiation, no adjustment to base rates and no improvement in conditions—just a cruel, cold cut. And this government will not stop it. They could today, but they'll choose not to. They could come in here right now and tell us that that's what they're going to do, but they won't. In the context of wages flatlining and business profits at record highs, this out-of-touch government says: 'That's okay. We'll give you a $10 tax cut.' This is a cut of $77 a week, and that is $10 to replace it. Under Labor, Bill Shorten will put penalty rates back, and Labor will double that tax cut for 10 million Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I'd like to speak today on the great initiative that is the Regional Investment Corporation—or RIC, as it's known to its many friends—which is to be based in the central west at Orange and will be operational from 1 July. The RIC will administer $2 billion in drought support in the form of concessional loans for our farmers and a $2 billion loan facility to help fast-track water infrastructure projects. The RIC is all about supporting country communities. That's why it's very important that it has been decentralised to a country area. The RIC will also bring with it 25 to 30 jobs, which are very welcome in the central west. Everyone in the region will get a shot at these jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It beggars belief that the Labor Party continues to oppose the RIC. They have opposed it at every turn, trying to kill jobs for country Australia and the drought relief that the RIC brings for our farmers. The member for Hunter kicks around this place in RM Williams boots, but nobody should be fooled. He doesn't fight for country Australia. He has the heart of a socks-and-sandals man. Out in the central west, we know him better as 'the shadow minister for recentralisation'. He wants to destroy the RIC and the jobs that it brings to our region. We'll be reminding folks about that at the next election. Country people support moving jobs out of the big city. The RIC is a win for regional Australia, and long may decentralisation like this continue.</span>

In my part of Western Sydney, people have finally got MRI access through their public hospital—one that Labor had funded in government but which had then been ripped out by the coalition in their first economic statement in 2013. If people in my area need an MRI scan to work out whether or not they have cancer, they have had to pay up to $500 a scan because the Turnbull government won't provide a Medicare licence for that machine. They have money for big corporates that want to shift money offshore; they don't have money for someone living in Mount Druitt who wants to work out whether or not they need help with something that is going to have a massive effect on them. They should be providing that Medicare licence to Mount Druitt Hospital. To the hospital's great credit, they've dropped the price from $500 to $150. It's still a lot for people whose average incomes are lower than the national and state median. If there's a choice between handing over billions to big business or saving the life of a local resident Mount Druitt resident, the choice is clear. They should be giving us that Medicare licence. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  The federal government is delivering $158 million in funding to expand Joondalup Hospital in my electorate of Moore. As a result of the strong advocacy efforts—and in cooperation with my neighbour, the member for Pearce—there will be 90 new public hospital beds, 75 mental health places, 25 beds in a new coronary care unit, eight new operating theatres and three new cardiac catheter laboratories. This investment is fully funded in the current budget and is designed to meet the healthcare needs of our growing population.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />I draw the attention of the House to a misleading advertisement circulating on social media, claiming that $4.67 million has been cut from the Joondalup Health Campus. Clearly, this is not the case, and it calls into question the credibility of the person who authorised the advertisement. In response, I have direct mailed every household in my electorate, advising of the fact that the government is delivering $158 million in funding to expand the Joondalup Health Campus in the budget. We will not let these false claims go unchallenged. The government is committed to delivering the best in health care, with the budget including $35.3 billion for the Medicare Guarantee Fund in the 2018-19 year to fund treatments listed on Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This represents a real and tangible increase in health funding, not a decrease, as was claimed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Australia has record-low wage growth. It is the standout statistic in the Australian economy, and every worker in this country knows it. What is the government's remedy for it? Cutting penalty rates. Which is why I was so proud that in this place on Monday the Leader of the Opposition introduced the Fair Work Amendment (Restoring Penalty Rates) Bill 2018. It was not a moment too soon, because this Sunday we will see the next round of penalty rate cuts, and this is the big one; it is much bigger than last year. In my electorate of Corio, up to 11,000 workers will be impacted by this cut. We know that the Prime Minister sees that labour costs are just another unit price on a profit and loss sheet. Indeed, he has compared it to being no different to the cost of a loaf of bread—an input cost there to be minimised.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Unlike loaves of bread, people have children, and children don't go to school on the weekend. Kids go and play sport, and parents need to be around to ferry them to that sport and to other activities. Some parents want to watch their kids play. All of this occurs on a weekend. Labor absolutely get that working on a weekend is a penalty. We also understand the vital income that penalty rates provide people in those households. I can assure you, a Shorten Labor government will restore penalty rates to this country. Before we get to that, the government could step up, bring this bill on and vote for it, which is what they should do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's like watching the outgassing of a beautiful comet. I first met the honourable member in 2001, at the Ashfield shopping mall at a polling booth. He was my local MP. He was mortified, when asking who I would be voting for, when I held up a picture of John Howard. Nonetheless, I have a soft spot for the member for Grayndler. I thought I would publically note my admiration for his recent Whitlam Oration:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, like many Australians, I'm confused. Does Labor really emphasise policymaking from the bottom up, or is the Leader of the Opposition making captain's calls on the run? Does Labor really respect and celebrate the efforts and importance of the business community, or are they going to hit 20,000 small- and medium-businesses with higher taxes? Does Labor even care about the 1.5 million workers threatened by the opposition leader's latest foray into the class war? We hope that the member for Grayndler can set the opposition leader straight.</span>

She's the Vicky Pollard of the Senate: 'Yeah, but no, but yeah, but no, but yeah.' In just the last few weeks, Senator Hanson has said no, then yes, then no, then maybe, and now I think we're back on no again. You would think it would be much easier to come to a firm decision when you've only got a caucus of two! The truth is that Senator Hanson continues to look after herself and votes with the LNP on every chance she gets. In fact, this calendar year, she has voted with the LNP 100 per cent of the time. In fact, all she has done this year is look after millionaires and big business. She has teamed up with the LNP to give herself a $7,000-a-year tax cut and provided a tax cut of just 10 bucks a week to ordinary workers. She pretends to support Queensland workers, but, instead, supports cuts to the penalty rates of Queensland workers, and new cuts, again, from 1 July this year. She may as well just apply for re-admission to the LNP.</span>

Yesterday the Prime Minister said that coal-fired power will be around forever. But Snowy Hydro has said that new coal doesn't stack up and it would mean that Snowy 2.0 is not viable. Isn't it the case that the government's plan to prop up coal-fired power with taxpayer funds will affect the viability of Snowy 2.0?</span>

The whole premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question is, as with so much of what he says here, completely bogus. The reality is that Labor has imposed higher and higher energy prices on Australian families. That is what Labor did. We are seeing now, thanks to our policies, retail prices coming down for the first time in a long time. We're starting to see—we are seeing, in fact—a halving of wholesale gas prices over 18 months, and we've seen wholesale generation prices come down by 30 per cent. Our policies are working. Labor wants to engage in an ideological war about one form of energy rather than another. That is how they created the problem in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the focus must be on lower energy prices. People have been paying too much for electricity. Focus on getting prices down, ensuring power is reliable and the lights stay on, ensuring you've got dispatchable power—coal is always going to be a big part of that—and making sure that you have got lower prices, but let the market and technology determine what is the best, most cost-effective solution. Our policy, the National Energy Guarantee, is technology agnostic. It is designed to ensure that you have dispatchable power, reliable power and affordable power and that you meet your Paris emissions targets. That can be done with a variety of technologies. Coal is a big part of it now. I believe it will be a big part of it for a very long time, but let the market and the competing technologies work it out.</span>

The honourable member is committed to supporting family businesses in his electorate and indeed around Australia, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who has declared war on small and medium family-owned businesses right around Australia, whether they're in Launceston, whether they're in Burnie or whether they're in Brisbane. Tens of thousands of family-owned businesses today know that the Leader of the Opposition and all of his Labor team are now coming after them to raise more tax, and that's going to mean fewer jobs. The Leader of the Opposition says he's against the top end of town and he wants to take on the banks and all those millionaires. One small business after another will have their viability threatened and the jobs of their employees threatened by Labor seeking to jack up the taxes they are paying.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had so many good cases of enterprising Australian businesses. Let me share with you one business: Evolve Skateboards, founded by Jason Howard and by Jeff Anning and his wife, Fleur Anning. It's only a small business. It's got 15 staff. It's on the Gold Coast. What they are doing, like all of these small businesses, is financing the growth of their business through retained earnings. That's how these small and medium family businesses grow, like Universal Trusses, which I visited this morning here in the ACT with Senator Seselja. It is an older business, 20 years old, but it's the same story. If you provide encouragement for these businesses, they will grow and they will employ.</span>

Yesterday the Prime Minister said coal-fired power will be around forever, but the head of the Energy Security Board has said there would be absolutely no way that anybody would be financing a new coal-fired generation plant. Why is the Prime Minister promising coal forever when his own Energy Security Board says coal is more expensive, more polluting and not more reliable? Is it because the Prime Minister doesn't actually determine his government's energy policy but the member for Warringah and Senator Hanson do?</span>

They want to turn a policy area that should be about engineering and economics into one that is all about ideology and politics. We need to ensure that Australians have the most affordable and cheapest energy possible. That should be the goal of policy, and it must be reliable, and we must meet our international commitments. The National Energy Guarantee achieves all three, and that is why it has such wide support. How retailers meet their obligations and what mix of generation they buy from is up to them. It is up to them and it is up to the market and, as technologies develop, different approaches will be taken.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the important thing is to maintain a laser-like focus on price and ensure that Australians stop paying too much for energy and electricity. You never hear the Labor Party talking about the cost of electricity. It's all politics. It's all ideology. The objective is lower energy prices. We are starting to see that. We're turning the corner on that. We're making up for the shocking mistakes Labor made with gas and the other shocking mistakes they made. What about in South Australia? It was getting to the point where, for all of their virtue, the Labor government there could say, 'We can generate all of our state's power with wind power.' They were so proud of that. Then the wind dropped and there was no power at all, just a long extension cord to the Latrobe Valley. The total failure of planning and the absence of engineering and economics is Labor's way.</span>

We're seeing the results in household and business bills. Labor failed on energy. We're getting it right for Australian families.</span>

He knows that a key component of the Turnbull government's plan for a stronger economy is to back businesses, small and large, to ensure that they employ more Australians. More than a million Australians have been employed since this government was first elected back in 2013. In the last 12 months, 80,000 young people have got a job under the policies of the Turnbull government. A key part of that plan is to ensure that small and large businesses have competitive rates of tax.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan started with small businesses, ensuring we redefined a small business as a business with a turnover up to $10 million and that those small businesses got a lower tax rate, got access to the instant asset write-off, which we extended, and got the lowest tax rate since the 1940s for small businesses—businesses like True Blue Glass at Loganholme in the member for Forde's electorate or WB Truck 'n' Trailer down in Burnie, which I visited. These are businesses with just a handful of employees that we have delivered lower rates of tax to. We've extended and legislated that tax relief for businesses up to $50 million. As the member for Corangamite was just saying, Hamlan Homes employs some 35 people and has a turnover between $10 and $50 million. And good old Coxon's Radiator Service up in Rocky have got 35 employees and a turnover of almost $50 million. We know that those businesses underpin regional economies. They underpin regional towns and centres across the country, providing young people with jobs and a future for those towns.</span>

He actually told the truth yesterday when he said that Labor will rip back the tax relief that we have legislated for businesses of between $10 million and $50 million in what the member for Bass reminded us of was a pure captain's call to go out and make that statement. This will cost, as a conservative estimate, around $1 million for every business over the next 10 years and about $12,500 or more per employee in those businesses. That is the cost of what this reckless Leader of the Opposition, this liability of a Leader of the Opposition, will do to businesses as he steals back the tax relief that this parliament has legislated.</span>

I'll repeat what I said in my earlier answer: the objective has to be to ensure that Australians have access to the cheapest possible power. The member for Sydney often wants to talk about hardworking Australian families and those that are battling, and she claims to be filled with empathy for them. Well, a lot of people can't afford to pay their power bills, and they want to have lower energy bills. They want to see cheaper electricity. The reality is that the Labor policies have driven energy prices up, and we are bringing them down.</span>

                  </a>  What has gone wrong in energy policy has been that mixture of ideology and idiocy, especially in South Australia, as the member for Port Adelaide is well aware. What we need is engineering and economics. Every form of generation has a role to play. The forms of generation have no moral characteristics; they have physical characteristics. Engineering and economics are the way to go. The National Energy Guarantee enables the technologies that do the job best at the relevant time to be deployed. It is completely technology agnostic and that is what should be adopted, because, as every leading business group and industry group around the country reaffirms, it will deliver the investment certainty we need. It will deliver more reliable power and it will deliver more affordable power. If there's going to be a unity ticket in this chamber, surely more reliable and more affordable energy would be that unity ticket? But, apparently not. Labor is still committed to ideology and idiocy, which can only have one result: less reliable and less affordable power. That is not fair to the hardworking Australian families the Labor Party claims to care about.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:17</span>):  Treasurer, in Australia, where only two entities buy and sell food, and in a world where 41 per cent of farm income is from government, the removal of collective bargaining in all tariff subsidies yarded Australian farmers for butchering by the banks. Can you assure the House that the royal commission will include the carrion for the receivers, and address the issue of a reconstruction bank enabling farmers to ride the rollercoaster of supply and demand? It won't remove the truncating by taxes of the ups, but it will at least stop the banks from elongating the downs with a continuous imposition of discretionary punitive charges.</span>

Can I assure him that the terms of reference would catch liquidators, to the extent that they were operating on behalf of a financial services entity—for example, a receiver—as defined in the letters patent. The Constitution has an insolvency head of power which would likely enable the commission to use its coercive powers to obtain evidence from liquidators. In looking at the conduct of liquidators, the commission may also seek to investigate other appointments, such as forensic investigators, accountants or valuers, which are often part of the receivership process, as the member would be aware. Referring to registered liquidators or receivers would single them out from the wide category of services—for example, accounts and orders that are similarly captured—and it may be inferred by some that other similar services are not included.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural debt was around $71.6 billion as at 30 June of 2017, and 96 per cent of that debt is held by the banks. Our agricultural sector exports are some $51.6 billion. Seventy per cent of Australian farm business is in grain, beef and sheep. It's also important to note, as the member would also be keenly aware, that these farm businesses typically have a turnover of less than $10 million.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the royal commission has been tasked to do is look at all of these matters I've referred to. I'm not going to prejudge—I'm sure the member wouldn't expect me to—the findings and recommendations of the royal commission. He's unconstrained in that matter and in relation to the specific issues he's raised and the proposals that he's put forward here. I understand he's ventilated at the commission itself. He will have the opportunity to respond to that and make such recommendations to the government as are appropriate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important, though, as we look at those recommendations, as we go through this very important process, that we want our banks to keep lending to business, to keep lending to farms and to be cognisant of how reliant our economy is on the extension of that capital. We do not want this process to result in a restriction of capital flow, whether it's into the farming sector or whether it's into the manufacturing sector or the services sector. We don't want to see a constriction of that. What we want to see is a more effective, more efficient and free-flowing practice from banks to ensure that they can support the growth in the economy, which they were doing during the global financial crisis. One of the reasons we survived that crisis was particularly because the banks continued to lend.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have to have a consciousness, as the member says, of the cycle that occurs in the ag sector, and that's why we have the farm management deposit scheme from the government's point of view, but we're of course open to all recommendations from the royal commission.</span>

He is a hardworking member. Before coming to this place, he was a hardworking businessman. He'd started businesses from scratch. He wasn't frightened to get a bit of dirt under his fingernails. He wasn't frightened to back himself. He wasn't frightened to take risks. He wasn't frightened to employ people. He had a go just like all of those small and medium family enterprises which those opposite want to cruel, want to cripple by taking away the tax relief that this government is providing them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He comes from Gladstone, and Gladstone is home to some of the best economic potential and the best economic drivers in this nation. It is one of this nation's economic powerhouses. It's home to Northern Oil Refinery. It's also home to Corfield's Electrical Service, a little medium-size company that employs 60 people. It's a fine business. It's having a go. Its owner, Ken Corfield, told the member for Flynn, 'Obviously, with extra cash to inject into the business, we can employ more staff and develop our companies to run more efficiently and forward plan, knowing we will have more funds to do business.' That's the sort of enterprise, that's the sort of endeavour that we want to foster on this side of the House. That's the sort of enterprise and endeavour that those opposite want to take away, want to steal away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also investing, as Liberals and Nationals, in Central Queensland, making roads such as the Bruce Highway safer through an investment of $10 million. The Northern Australia Roads Program has $59 million for the Capricorn Highway, the beef roads program has $20 million for road train access and the Bridges Renewal Program includes $5 million for the Three Moon Creek replacement. We're connecting country communities. We're making sure that those regional communities can connect to ports such as Gladstone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But confidence is not something that you see opposite. There's no Labor confidence in businesses to back themselves. We've got some by-elections coming up, and people can get behind the candidates that this government is putting up or they can just be antibusiness as usual. That's what they'll get in Braddon. That's what they'll get in Longman. That's what they'll get in Mayo if they don't back the government candidates, who are going to provide a voice around the table of influence, a voice around that ministerial table to actually get things done. Labor has no confidence in Burnie, no confidence in Ulverstone, and I know that because I visited Ulverstone on my small business roadshow with Roger Jaensch last year, and we heard from small businesses there. They were backing the government. They were backing themselves, moreover. They were backing the lowest tax rate in 77 years. They were backing the instant asset write-off. But I tell you what they don't need down in Tasmania. I tell you what they don't need in Longman, and that's Labor's antibusiness policies. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  There is a global competition for capital, skills and talent. That's why Australian businesses must be able to compete globally to attract these resources from overseas and provide jobs and opportunities for our best and brightest talent here in Australia. I couldn't put it more succinctly than members of Labor's front bench. The member for McMahon, the shadow Treasurer, said on 11 July 2013:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He got it then. The Leader of the Opposition as Assistant Treasurer said to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Melbourne:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We couldn't agree more. But yesterday the Leader of the Opposition went rogue. He went off the reservation when he turned around and said completely the opposite and committed Labor to increasing taxes on Australian businesses, thus putting at risk the livelihoods of millions of Australians across the country employed in small and medium-sized businesses. This was no brain snap. Upon reflection, the Labor Party and its major benefactor, the ACTU, have committed to a war on business. Comrade Sally McManus has often accused business of wage theft. She says that businesses act against the interests of their staff.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I reminded the House of the most egregious example of a nation that has declared war on business, and yes, it's Venezuela. You will recall that the CFMEU is campaigning to have Australia embrace the policies of that brutal dictatorship. It seems that solidarity with Venezuela runs deep in the veins of the ALP. It was not so long ago that the ALP was urging for a guest-of-government invitation to be extended to Hugo Chavez, saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… we feel that our shared ideals of social justice and democracy bring us close together … what Venezuela has been able to achieve in so little time will be a source of inspiration and ideas for many in Australia.</span>

He stands here and wants to portray himself as the enemy of multinationals, big banks and insurance companies, but the businesses he's taking on are to be found in every town, in every suburb, in every electorate represented here in this House. They represent millions and millions of jobs. More than half the private sector workforce work for businesses with a turnover of $50 million or less. Whether it be a business like Stubbs Constructions in Burnie, Universal Trusses in Hume or Kennedy's Timbers in Brisbane, on the border between Petrie and Longman, these are businesses that have many employees—50, 60, 70 employees—all of whom depend on the owners of the business investing in the business and buying the best and latest technology.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know he's particularly keen on small and family-sized enterprises like Joyce Kitchens—who, for over 20 years, have been building custom kitchens in his electorate and beyond, to help those people who want a new kitchen but also to employ many people in his electorate. This is the sort of business that is going to be impacted by Labor's hike on small and medium-sized enterprises and on those family businesses. In fact, 97 per cent of all businesses in this country are small and medium-sized businesses. That's why, on this side of the chamber, we are delivering tax relief for those businesses—for the more than 15,000 businesses in the seat of Tangney and the millions of other businesses throughout the country and the people that they employ.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, this would all change under the Leader of the Opposition, if he had his way, because the Leader of the Opposition has finally revealed his hand: he wants to punish those businesses. In his wacky captain's call yesterday, he said that Labor would roll back those tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises. He said that he would punish those businesses that to seek to employ, to invest, to grow and to hire more Australians. He has promised before that his tax policies simply focus on the top end of town. He has said that he is focused on the millionaires. But let me ask the Leader of the Opposition: how are small, medium-sized and family businesses the top end of town? How are the people that they employ millionaires? Of course, they are not. In a prepared speech, he had the audacity to say that he was going to back small business. In his prepared speech he said he would 'hug' small and medium-sized enterprises. He walks out the door, and then he mugs them. It is the 'hug and mug' that the Leader of the Opposition is so famous for. You only need to ask the workers that he represented—</span>

They should all have competitive tax rates. That's what they should all have because Australians work for all of those businesses, and they all deserve to work for businesses that have a competitive rate of tax so their jobs are more secure. What is very clear is that, under the leader of the Labor Party, Australians' jobs would not be secure. They would not be secure because it is his policy to jack up the taxes on small businesses, medium-sized businesses and large businesses. Yesterday, we had a small shard of truth from the Leader of the Opposition as he fessed up to the fact that the Labor Party would increase taxes again for businesses of more than $10 million.</span>

Defence industries across Australia are almost all small and medium enterprises. There are probably a dozen that we would regard as primes. There are probably about 3,000 small and medium enterprises in the defence industry spread across the country, and many of those would have turnovers of between $2 million and $50 million. There are companies like Yamba Welding and Engineering in the member for Page's electorate, which is building and maintaining boats for a Navy company. There are companies like Airflite, in the member for Pearce's electorate, which provides maintenance for PC9 trainers at RAAF Base Pearce, or Fibre Tech, which I visited with the member for Corangamite, in Geelong, which makes fibre, cables and nets for rigging for air transport for the ADF. Also, in Braddon, in Penguin, Penguin Composites make bonnets for the Hawkei. ERIPIO, in Longman, in Caboolture, provide beaching equipment and folding stretchers for Defence. Even in Mayo, in Uraidla, there is Novacom, which is a key partner in Thales's minesweeping exports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these companies, spread right across Australia—and that's only half-a-dozen—have basically got turnovers of $2 million to $50 million, and they are replicated right throughout regional Australia and in the capital cities. They are the companies from which the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip away the company tax cuts that this government has provided. They are the companies that the Leader of the Opposition wants to declare war on. They're the companies—small, family enterprises, many of them—with good ideas, who are hardworking and are making good because of this government's investment in defence and defence industry capability, the largest in our peacetime history. That's what's going on out in the real world. The Leader of the Opposition wants to make those companies' jobs much, much harder. He wants to belt those companies. He wants to send them broke.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bass got it right today. It wasn't a very pretty interview, it must be said. The member for Bass got it right. The Leader of the Opposition's war on business is a war on jobs; it's a war on growth; it's a war on the Australian economy; it is a war on family businesses and small and medium enterprises; it's a war on wages. The Leader of the Opposition isn't some mythological fighter, fighting against the top end of town on behalf of small and medium enterprises. He's belting small and medium enterprises. They're not the top end of town. And he's saying to families on $95,000 a year that they are the top end of town and trying to take away their personal income tax cuts. The Leader of the Opposition is a dangerous man for Australian families and for Australian businesses.</span>

Why is the Prime Minister doing nothing to protect young jobseekers but everything to give big business an $80 billion handout?</span>

The Australian public knows that this government stands for strong border protection policies. As we're seeing in the United States at the moment and as we're seeing right across Europe, the issue of illegal migration is going to be with us for a long time to come. We know that this government has now turned back over 30 boats. Had those 30 boats got through, we would be seeing the same scenes that we saw when Labor was last in government, with people, tragically, drowning at sea and children piling into detention centres, as we're seeing on our television screens out of the Mediterranean and in the US at the moment. So it is incredibly important for the public to understand what each side of politics in this country represents when it comes to the very important issue of border protection. This government's position has remained consistent. When Mr Howard left office in 2007, there were four people in detention, and no children. Under Labor, 8,000 children were put in detention, 1,200 people drowned at sea and 50,000 people came on 800 boats. As I said, there is no doubt in the public's mind that we on this side of the parliament, the coalition, fully support our Border Force personnel in keeping our borders secure. But people are completely mystified as to what the Labor Party stands for when it comes to border protection policy.</span>

Under this government, we've taken gross debt, which was growing at 30 per cent under the Labor Party, under the current budget and forward estimates to two per cent. From 30 per cent to two per cent. That's what's happened. We have wrestled Labor's gorilla of debt to the ground; that's what we've done. Net debt this year turns around and we pay it down by $30 billion over the next four years and $230 billion over the next 10 years. That's what this government has been doing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about what's happening in terms of the economy and what the impact of that is on revenue. We all know how many times the member for Lilley took a swing and a miss when it came to estimating revenue, but it never stopped them from spending the money! He was out by five per cent every single year; a swing and a miss every single time. What I can inform the House of today, as the Minister for Finance has, is that our company tax revenue, as of the end of May, to the end of the year, is up by $1.1 billion. That's what's happening. Increasingly of importance is the fact that our expenditure at that time is also down $3 billion. This is a government living within its means. This is a government that has taken the debt and the deficit of the Labor Party and has worked tirelessly year after year since we were elected to turn it all around. In 2019-20 we will come back to surplus one year ahead of projection.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />What the Labor Party is about is taxes going up and up and up, whether it's the $5 billion tax on retirees or putting up taxes on small- and medium-sized businesses. The Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Labor Party, and the shadow Treasurer have to be honest with the businesses of Australia: are you going to reject and reverse the tax cuts for small businesses between $2 million and $10 million? The Leader of the Opposition, on a captain's call, could go out there yesterday and unilaterally declare that the tax cut's gone for $10 million to $50 million. We know that the member for Sydney doesn't think it should happen. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has gone around telling everybody that he's going to reverse the whole package. Tell them straight. I know that he finds it hard to make telling the truth a habit, but on this one occasion he should be clear to the Australian public and the millions of businesses and the millions of Australians who work in those businesses: are you going to claw back the tax cut that was legislated by this parliament for businesses between $2 million and $10 million? It's a pretty simple question. The shadow Treasurer has been running around in circles on it for two years. He can't fess up to it.

The Leader of the Opposition would have you believe that that is a business, already facing a national giant, that does not deserve to keep more of its own generated profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition is happy to trash businesses in pursuit a class war. He does not understand that high turnovers don't necessarily mean high profits, because he has never been involved in a business or the running of a business. There are businesses all over his electorate, and every electorate of every member in this country, where that equation is the same. They are the backbone of all our seats. The Leader of the Opposition has gone over the top. He's out of the trench, head first into battle against this sector of the economy. My question to those opposite—I don't have to ask it on this side, just of those opposite—especially those in the economic leadership team, is whether they have the courage to stand up for this most important sector of our economy. Those businesses are in all of your seats. They employ an overwhelming majority—70 per cent—of Australians. Do not stand behind your leader and sell them out for the sake of a cheap political class war.</span>

I think it's a shame that the member for Bass isn't getting an opportunity to ask a question. I know that his leader probably hauled in him and said, 'Oh, Mr Hart, what a mess!' But we say he spoke for all Australians when he revealed the shocking captain's call that the Leader of the Opposition made—a job-destroying call. The two honourable members I just referred to—the member for Franklin and the member for Bass—are both from Tasmania, a state that's enjoying stronger economic performance. It has many family owned businesses. I talked about one yesterday, Stubbs Constructions, but there are so many of them in Tasmania. Often businesses have been run by many generations of the same family and they've been investing in them out of retained earnings. They are given real confidence by the government's support for them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bass pointed out that he understands how important it is for businesses to make profits. Indeed, in his maiden speech, the member for Bass said that he understood the importance of small business, and he feels that. So you can imagine how distressed he was on behalf of those businesses at the heart of Launceston's economy, a city that is doing really well and benefiting from one of our city deals, I might add. It really is getting strong support there. How betrayed did he feel, and how much did he yearn for a leader of the Labor Party who understood business, a leader who wanted to evoke the great traditions of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, who cared about business, who recognised when that business is doing well the workers are doing well? That interview with Brian Carlton reads like a cry of pain. It really does. The member for Bass was being pressed by the dogged interviewer. Thirteen times he was asked to support the Leader of the Opposition. Finally, he mumbled some sort of response. It was a shocking interview—cruel, in fact. I have a lot of admiration for Brian Carlton, but he should have let the member go when he begged to go. </span>

He knows that when he goes back to Launceston they will say, 'You need a new leader.' That's what they will say to the member for Bass.

The other record that goes along with that is this government's track record in creating jobs for Australians: we've created over one million jobs over the last five years. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in Leichhardt not that long ago and took that opportunity to open a new tourism investment, the new Cairns Aquarium. It is a new investment in the tourism industry that is helping to create new jobs. I note that this government is continuing with its plan to make sure that we create further incentive for investment. We're creating further incentive for investment, especially in Australia's small to medium-sized enterprises, by reducing the tax burden on them. We know that lower levels of tax on Australia's small and medium-sized enterprises will drive investment, and that investment will drive economic growth and drive jobs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the member for Leichhardt asks about threats. Well, unfortunately, there are threats to the creation of new jobs and there are threats to investment. Those threats to the 600,000 Australians employed in the tourism industry come from this heavily divided and very confused opposition. Because we start to see, increasingly, that the little fight that's breaking out between the member for Grayndler, the aspiring Leader of the Opposition, and the current Leader of the Opposition is driving more confusion and more division on that side of the House. You see it manifesting every single day now. Now we see the Leader of the Opposition moving to block the member for Port Adelaide from having a chance in Adelaide, instead forcing the member for Port Adelaide to take his fight—</span>

                  </a>  Fair enough, Mr Speaker. Let me move away from the division on that side of the House and focus on the fact that that is actually having an impact on investment decisions that people make. On Kangaroo Island, Southern Ocean Lodge, for example, is a small business that has employed 50 locals in an island economy. But we actually see now that those businesses are having further investment threatened. And that investment, Mr Speaker, is threatened because of the policy division on Labor's side of the House. </span>

I think she's referred to a large multinational company in the matter of tax, and it gives me the opportunity to advise the House that, as at 31 May this year, $2.7 billion in liabilities has been raised—additional revenue—against multinationals and public groups. Of this, $1.2 billion has been attributed to the Tax Avoidance Taskforce government commitments. This is based on legislation Labor voted against. $1.6 billion in additional liabilities has been raised against wealthy individuals and associated groups, including trusts and aggressive tax planning, and, of that, over $1 billion has been attributed to the Tax Avoidance Taskforce government commitments. I add that, in addition to this fine work that's brought $7 billion of additional revenue into the tax net—it's one of the reasons the Treasurer has announced some improved numbers in terms of government revenues today—we've also seen a significant impact on additional GST paid: approximately $460 million in 2017-18 year to date as a result of global—</span>

Over the forward estimates, a total of $6.5 billion of additional GST revenues will be raised to pay for schools, hospitals and roads in all of the states and territories as a result of the government's integrity measures. So we do believe in lower taxes. We know that because it encourages investment and employment. It encourages more jobs and higher wages, all the very cogent arguments the Leader of the Opposition used to address on this subject before he did a backflip and abandoned economic common sense.</span>

She, like all members on this side of the chamber, is backing every business, small and large, to grow, because we know on this side of the chamber that, when businesses grow, they employ more people, they generate more wealth and they create more money with which we can fund the essential services that we need: the schools, the hospitals, the PBS listings. There are businesses such as Global Pumps in her electorate. It is a 40-person business earning revenues between $10 million and $20 million. It's exporting to the world. We want to back that business to the hilt. We want it to be not a 40-person business but an 80-person business, and consequently we are delivering tax cuts for Global Pumps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that, we're building infrastructure so that they can get their product around the country more easily. We're developing trade schemes; the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment is signing more export trade agreements so they can export more. In my space we're developing innovative visa products so that, if they can't find Australian skills to do the jobs, we'll have visas to enable them to attract the best and brightest from around the world to enable that business to continue to grow. Certainly, from next month the Global Talent Scheme will be kicking off to allow businesses like it to attract the best and brightest from around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between us and the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely stark. With the Leader of the Opposition, when he looks at a businesses like Global Pumps he doesn't see a family owned business, which he wants to back and wants to grow—no, he sees the big end of town. He sees the big end of town that needs to be punished. He sees a Collins Street business of fat cats, apparently, that should have their taxes go up even further, and that's exactly what the Leader of the Opposition is promising—not a tax cut, but a tax increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting thing is the Leader of the Opposition does not have everybody behind him. There are differences of opinion on that other side of the chamber. We know that there's the crouching tiger over there in the member for Grayndler. He's ready there to pounce. He doesn't agree. We also know there are hidden dragons on their side who are briefing out to Simon Benson, saying that they do not like the position which the Leader of the Opposition is taking either.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are backing business. We are backing businesses like Global Pumps, because we want them to grow. The Leader of the Opposition should also back these businesses, ditch those company tax increases and let these companies grow. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  This is a matter of real public importance. A matter of what choices the parliament makes, what priorities it adopts and what values it implements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I want to talk past the government to the Australian people. The fact of the matter is that wherever I travel in this great country the two biggest priorities for all of us, and for the people I talk to, are their family and their health. It's the questions about: can you pay the bills? Do you have enough for a holiday? Are you able to make sure your kids can get a good education—do an apprenticeship if they want or go to university if that's their inclination? They talk about whether or not their kids will ever be able to buy their first home. They talk about their ageing parents and will they be in a position to care for them and what can be done?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They always talk about their health. I was talking to a former member of mine who is an underground miner in northern Tassie. He was going to work, doing a shift at the mine. He had just taken his daughter to the local hospital. She's battling cancer. These are the issues which affect the Australian people and this is what matters to me. This is what matters to the Australian people. This is what matters to the Labor Party. This is what Labor values are about—a fair go all around. The Australian people do not talk to me about the urgency or the importance of an $80 billion corporate tax handout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm privileged to do a lot of town hall meetings around Australia. I have literally spoken and listened to tens of thousands of our fellow Australians in every location. What I want to say to the Australian people is that the issues that I understand and that Labor understand are important are: how are the people on the pension going? How are they making ends meet? Will there be an affordable place for child care? Does the childcare worker get paid appropriately? What to do about the waiting lists in hospitals? The challenge that Tasmanians have that they have to go to the mainland to get medical services that other people take for granted. The parents raise the issue about lack of resources in the schools, especially when their kids are getting bullied. We talk about energy prices in these meetings—they go up and up and up. We talk about the poor administration of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the lack of putting people with disabilities at the centre of these services. We talk about the frustrating search for adequate and dignified aged care. The parents talk about apprenticeships for their kids like the ones they once had the chance to do. Certainly people do talk about the boats with me, but they don't say that the answer to stopping the boats is indefinite detention on Manus and Nauru. People raise the low level of Newstart and whether or not an older Australian has a fair go when it comes to discrimination and whether they keep being sent for interviews manifestly inappropriate and soul destroying for the jobseeker. The workers in the audiences talk about labour hire and how it's used to undermine existing conditions at work, and the people in insecure work talk about the inability to get regular rosters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we talk about housing, and people complain they feel the deck is stacked against them. Some people complain about foreign investors buying residential housing, and others complain that, whenever their kids save up for the deposit, they find the price of the house just leaps the next $200,000 and they've got to go back to the start again. Then there are plenty of people who talk to me not about the inability even to own a house but about the cost of rent, secure housing, public housing and social housing. People talk to me about the job losses in every part of Australia. We hear the government boast about job creation, but they never seem to worry about the people who lose their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, I hear about the NBN failures—the fact that people have to wait for countless unmet installation turn-ups and missed appointments, and the fact that the service drops out. They talk to me about the fact that as small businesses they get ignored not just by NBN Co but by the government who delivered the policy. They complain to me about the treatment of small business by banks. They do complain about being made to feel second class if you receive a government payment, because of the cutbacks at Centrelink. They certainly ask me why politicians don't listen to them more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are things I don't get asked about by the vast bulk of the Australian people, the people making ends meet and working hard. The small business minister, when he was taunting me, 'Oh, you've ever only signed a mortgage.' Well, whether or not that's true—which it's not—what a patronising statement that people who might have signed mortgages and haven't inherited a lot of money somehow are not as smart as other people! I never get asked about how we do income splitting in discretionary trusts for adult members of the family, and I do not get asked about the importance of wedging Labor on national security, and I don't get a lot of complaints about the ABC, and I do not get asked about buying the Liddell Power Station—although it is fair to say that some people challenge the role of privatisation in energy prices. I never get asked why we aren't giving the banks a $17 billion tax cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am interested in what is real in the lives of Australians, and I know that on 1 July those two important priorities of families and health will take another setback. There will be more stagnation of the standard of living in the country. On 1 July, there are new cuts to child care, which will hurt families; new cuts to family payments, which will hurt families; and new cuts to Sunday penalty rates, which will hurt families. This is on top of the Medicare freeze, which hurts families; the rising private health insurance premiums, which hurt families; and the power bills that keep increasing, which hurt families. This is on top of the longest period of wage stagnation in the nation's recorded economic data. That hurts families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So today I say to the Australian people: Labor is listening to you, and we know what the real issues are. We understand that, when your family's okay and your health's okay, you have a fighting chance to really start thinking about having quality of life and a decent standard of life. That is why our party will not be deterred by the catcalling, shouting and buffoonery of a government who desperately want to pretend that somehow, if we don't back the tawdry, meaningless, shallow nature of their tax cut agenda, this is not the right thing to do. We will offer Australian workers better tax cuts, and we do, but we will also offer a plan to lift the living standards of families. We will invest in schools, we will invest in hospitals and we will invest in the safety net. We will make sure we pay down this ballooning national debt, but we will not do it at the price of cuts to schools, hospitals and the standard of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can make all of these promises because we've made a choice. We've made a choice not to go with $80 billion of corporate tax giveaways and $143 billion of unfunded personal income tax cuts on the never-never. We understand—and our economic values are very straightforward—that when there is a fair go for all, when this country becomes more equal, then we make progress as a nation. I did say that politics is about choices and values; it's about making hard decisions. I must talk about a senator in the other house, Senator Hanson. She understands it's about choices. She clearly enjoys it. She wants to take her time to savour the experience of making choices. Indeed, she started out in favour; she made a choice to back the $17 billion to big banks. Then she was against it, then she was for it, and now she's against it again. Then she said, 'I haven't tried undecided yet, so I'll give that a go.' People have said she's a flip-flopper, but 'flip-flop' implies changing once, not every few hours. People might say this is an unfair interpretation of Senator Hanson's position. Let's put it in her words. Last night, as she reproved those pesky Labor senators to put them back in their box, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I said no originally, then I said yes, then I said no and I stuck to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She stuck it for nearly 12 hours. Post-it notes stick for longer than Pauline Hanson does to her decisions! This morning she said on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> show, 'I'll change my mind as many times as I want to ensure that I come up with the right decision.' To be clear, Senator Hanson: the right decision is not simply to vote with the LNP 90 per cent of the time. The right decision is to back battlers, not to back the big end of town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party homing pigeon has one destination in mind, and that is to give the banks a $17 billion tax cut. It's a decision which the people of Australia will understand. If Australians vote for our Labor team, we can promise that the early years of your child's education will be properly funded. We will invest $17 billion in schools and teachers, based upon need. We'll renovate the TAFEs instead of closing them. We'll train Australian apprentices instead of importing skills. We'll make sure kids in every postcode in Australia don't have to rely on having rich parents to get a university education, to get a good job or to buy a house. We will make choices because we know our values and we know to stick to them. The fundamental choice in this matter of public importance for the Australian people is that the Australian people have priorities. Long after people here have moved onto other things, long after the debates are finished, the priorities of the Australian people will remain the same: their families and their health. The Labor Party will make sure that you can raise your family with financial security and dignity, and we'll protect and support your health. That is what the people expect.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  The next time the Leader of the Opposition walks into one of these businesses that he talks about, I want him to look those owners in the eye, look those workers in the eye, and tell them that he wants to increase their taxes. That's what the Leader of the Opposition should do. Every time he wants to use one of them as a backdrop while he's wearing his high-vis, every time he wants to use them for a political stunt, I want him to tell those owners and those workers, 'I want to increase your taxes.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the Leader of the Opposition run around this country for two years talking about the billionaires and the millionaires. He's been talking about the big, nasty multinationals—the Apples and the Googles—and saying that these are the people he's going to go after, and now what have we got? We’ve got the Leader of the Opposition saying that he doesn't want to keep taxes where they are for small family businesses in this country that might employ as few as a dozen staff, or fewer, and that treat their employees more like family than employees; he wants to increase their taxes—they're the nasty, terrible billionaires and millionaires at the top end of town. So when he talks about visiting these small businesses and these small family enterprises, I want him to look them in the eye and tell them, 'You need to pay more tax.' But we know the Leader of the Opposition won't do that, and we know his backbench doesn't support him. It's wonderful to see that there are some sensible Labor people who want to repudiate what the Leader of the Opposition has done. They want to run away at a million miles an hour, because who would want to be associated with such a tawdry policy? It treats small Australian businesses that are trying to get ahead as some kind of second-class group of citizens who don't pay their way and who should be paying more tax. What was the most telling example of running away from the Leader of the Opposition?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was referred to in question time today. It was the member for Bass, who has got a promising career ahead of him in radio, I'm sure! He was asked by the presenter, 'Ross, are you on a unity ticket with your leader, Bill Shorten?' The member for Bass said, 'The leader has announced that he would support a reduction in—sorry, a repeal of the tax rate. It has not been discussed, as I understand, by shadow cabinet.' The presenter said: 'This is a captain's call on which your leader has staked his leadership, I would argue, and here I'm getting from you a bit of equivocation. Do you support the bloke or not? Do you back your leader Bill Shorten's call to repeal the tax for companies with a turnover of between $10 and $50 million?' The member for Bass said, 'Well, that's a matter that has been announced by Mr Shorten.' The presenter said: 'So you don't, Ross. You don't support this, do you?' The member for Bass said, 'Let's have a conversation about this at another time.' I could read on and on, and we could spend the next six minutes going through that transcript. It's pretty repetitive, but on 13 occasions he tries to run a million miles from this Leader of the Opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very interesting to hear the Leader of the Opposition's MPI. He wasn't talking to the Australian people. He wasn't talking to the government. He was talking to his backbench. I must say there's some glimmer of hope on the Labor backbench, because they didn't look very enthusiastic with the Leader of the Opposition—and nor should they. This reckless Leader of the Opposition who has run around for two years making a whole lot of claims about Australians, the economy and who he was going after—the top end of town—where has he landed? The Leader of the Opposition goes for those who can't fight back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't be surprised that he goes after small Australian businesses—independent grocers, small manufacturers, car dealers, car repairers. They're who he's going after. But we shouldn't be surprised, because who is the other group that the Leader of the Opposition has gone after for his unsustainable spending? The only other group he has gone after in the same way as small Australian businesses is our retirees. The single biggest tax increase from the Leader of the Opposition, if he were to be elected, would be to go after the savings of retirees by ensuring they can't use their franking credits. Again, the top end of town, the so-called nasty billionaires and millionaires, get to keep their franking credits under the Leader of the Opposition. But low-income retirees don't get to use them. So we've got low-income retirees who the Leader of the Opposition is going after. We've got small businesses that the Leader of the Opposition is going after. So we know that those who he doesn't think can fight back are the ones who are going to fund his unsustainable spending spree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next time the Leader of the Opposition tries to use a small business as a backdrop while he wears his hi-vis, I want to remind him that he wants to increase taxes on 20,000 small businesses that employ 1½ million Australians—20,000 Australian businesses that are competing to export around the world, that are competing in our economy, and employ 1½ million Australians. That's who the Leader of the Opposition is going after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the member for Bass, who has just walked in. I welcome him and say he is a glimmer, an absolute ray of light, on the Labor backbench. Thirteen times! Is the member for Bass leaving the chamber? He didn't get asked to leave the chamber, surely? Please stay, Member for Bass. You'll assist our MPI! Oh, he got asked to leave. I hope the cameras panned around at that point in time. The member for Bass was asked to leave the chamber. The member for Bass was told that he's not assisting the MPI and he was asked to leave the chamber. Unbelievable! This Labor Party is unbelievable. Shameless!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was giving the member for Bass some points for being brave and fronting up, and what happens? He gets asked to leave the chamber—unbelievable! The member for Bass will now be going to some sort of Labor Party re-education camp. They all go through it at some point in time. The shadow Treasurer wrote a book about how reducing taxes increases investment and wealth, and he went to the same re-education camp where the member for Bass is off to now: how to do a radio interview and support the tawdry, disgraceful policy of your Leader of the Opposition. His instincts to repudiate the Leader of the Opposition 13 times were correct, because this Leader of the Opposition is unfit to lead his party, let alone this country. He has been running around for two years—</span>

The Leader of the Opposition in raising this MPI clearly wasn't speaking to the Australian people or the government; he was speaking to his backbench. I say to the Labor backbench that this Leader of the Opposition is unfit to lead your party, because he believes small Australian businesses, people who put their hard-earned on the line and treat their employees more like family, are somehow the top end of town—big, nasty millionaires and billionaires who need to pay more tax to fund his unsustainable spending. All of this is on top of every other group he wants to attack, including Australian low-income retirees living on $25,000 or $30,000 a year, who might have up to a quarter of their income ripped away by this Leader of the Opposition. It's clear: his leadership has failed. The member for Bass was right, his instincts were right and we'd love to see him back in the chamber. Bring back the member for Bass.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  You know you're under the government's skin when a wannabe stands for 10 minutes and lectures us about his own obsessions, his own fantasies, his own private world over there—nothing whatsoever to do with the topic of the MPI today. Not one minute was spent trying to justify this government's use of $80 billion in precious taxpayer funds whilst at the same time cutting all the essential services required in our community. This man, I understand, heads up the 'Parliamentary Friends of Payday Lenders'. This man stands in this chamber to defend the indefensible, the very companies that prey on the most vulnerable and marginalised in our community, the very companies that stand to gain so much from government policies. These members opposite dare to stand up in this chamber and pretend to occupy some high moral ground now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sorry; that doesn't cut it with people in the gallery or in Newcastle. When I'm in my community, what do people want to talk to me about? It is exactly the things articulated by the Leader of the Opposition a few minutes ago. What are you doing to health and education? Let me tell you about your decision, your choice, to waste $17 billion of precious public dollars—not your money—by giving it away to people like the four big banks. Well, I've got to tell you: if anyone on the government side can stand up and tell me who in the community actually backs that in, I will be flabbergasted. That is because I am yet to meet a single Australian who says: 'Do you know what? Despite everything I've heard in the royal commission, those guys need a break. They need a $17 billion break. Don't give that $17 billion to my local schools. Let's not fund education. God, no! Who needs those dollars? Do our kids? Not at all!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Newcastle, I've got schools that are all facing cuts, that are all not getting the money that was once promised. There was that unity ticket—remember that famous interview with the member for Warringah? We were 'on a unity ticket', with 'not a cigarette paper' between us on health and education? Remember that? Well, every school in Newcastle is losing $350,000 on average each year, this year and next year. I have not met a single parent who says: 'Give those banks a break! Our P&amp;Cs don't need the money. We'll just keep fundraising. We'll just have more fetes, more lamington drives. That's fine; that's how we'll fund our schools from now on.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about hospitals? In my electorate of Newcastle 10 million bucks is coming out of hospitals. That's dollars that are not going into additional nursing staff, reducing waiting lists, helping out on security matters at the hospital—for example, in those ever-burdened emergency departments. There is $6.8 million out of the John Hunter Hospital, a major regional hospital. Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, I know people in your own electorate would be coming into the John Hunter Hospital for emergency care and treatment—6.8 million bucks ripped out of that hospital. Calvary Mater Newcastle—$1.6 million ripped out. The kids' hospital, the John Hunter Children's Hospital, isn't even spared from these cuts—$1.2 million out of that. How many nurses is that that we lose from delivering quality health care in our towns and cities?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing that defines the difference between the government and the members on this side of the House now more than those choices we make. We make no apologies for funding health and education and no apologies for not funding big banks, which, frankly, have spent years ripping off the very vulnerable people that that member just previously tried to defend, the very people that get attacked by payday lenders—the blokes he thinks are on the money in this House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  The Australian people understand that, when those opposite say they're coming after the big end of town, what they really mean is that they're coming after you. That is because they are coming after Australians from all walks of life, from all economic backgrounds, and they are coming after every single category of Australians. They say that a business with $10 million of revenue is some massive multinational that shouldn't get any support, despite the fact that those businesses are typically suburban family businesses and employ 1.5 million Australians. They say they should not have any support. They say that a crane operator should pay $940 more tax per year. They say that a drilling technician should pay $2,200 extra tax per year. They want a forklift driver to pay almost $4,000 extra tax every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is absolutely true, because they voted against the historic personal tax reform that was passed through this place last week. They voted against that. By doing so, they say to the forklift driver, 'Pay $4,000 more tax,' and for a miner it is $4,061. They want a miner to pay $4,000 more tax. And they say this is about the big end of town. Last time I checked, the definition of 'the big end of town', did not include small businesses, did not include forklift drivers, did not include crane operators and did not include miners. So, every time you hear them say 'the big end of town', what you need to keep in mind is that what they are really doing is coming after virtually all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about retirees? My image of the average retiree is not the same as the image that those opposite would have of some sort of massive multinational corporation. Now, I might be wrong on that, because clearly their view is that a retiree couple that have saved a little bit of money and maybe got $50,000 income a year are the big end of town. That's what they say. They say those retirees are from the big end of town, that they should be penalised through higher taxes and that they should not in any way have their achievements recognised. They say that their taxes should be increased. They shake their heads over there, but what the members opposite need to understand is that they are all individually positioning themselves to become the tax collectors for the Shorten state. That is what they are doing. They will become the tax collectors for the Shorten state. That is absolutely what they will be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bruce has a suburban electorate in Melbourne. I'm sure the member for Bruce will be very aggressively distributing pamphlets and maybe sharing some Facebook posts to all the members of his electorate, saying: 'If you happen to be a forklift driver, you're going to pay $4,000 more tax under me. If you happen to be a retiree couple, you are going to pay substantially more tax.' There are no doubt thousands of retirees who would be affected in his electorate. If you opposite believe that to be the right thing to do—and evidently you do, because that's the policy that you've all signed onto—then you should celebrate it and go and tell those retirees that they should pay $5 billion more in tax a year. I'm sure you will do that because I'm sure that you want to be tax collectors. Those opposite want to be tax collectors. They want to smash ordinary Australians with higher taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fascinating, wasn't it, to listen to Tasmanian radio today? I don't do it very often. I probably should do it more often, and I might after what I heard today. The member for Bass gave a fantastic contribution. The interviewer asked, 'Do you back your leader?' The member for Bass said, 'Well, that's a matter that's been announced by Mr Shorten.' The interviewer asked, 'So, Ross, you don't support what your leader's done?' The member for Bass said: 'I'm not saying that, Brian. I'm not saying that.' The interviewer said, 'But you're not saying you agree with him either.' 'Let's have a conversation about that another time,' is what the member for Bass said. He didn't want to sign up to this appalling tax increase because he knows that it is poison for jobs in regional Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There must be a lot of people in Braddon who are thinking about the upcoming by-election. They know that those opposite represent tax collection on ordinary Australians. They know that, every time they hear those opposite talk about 'the big end of town' or 'evil multinationals', what they're really saying is that they are coming after them. They are coming after ordinary Australians with unprecedented tax increases of some $290 billion. That is absolutely the wrong thing for this country. We are a low-tax government while they want to tax Australians excessively.</span>

                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  Today's question time was interesting, to say the at least. The thing for me that connected to this MPI was when the Prime Minister said that he was interested in a unity ticket. Clearly, the Prime Minister has either a tin ear or a very short memory, because I clearly remember the promises about a unity ticket. I know where I was when the government, then in opposition, promised a unity ticket on school education. I know exactly where I was, because I wasn't the member for Lalor. I was a school principal sweating on the Gonski money being delivered to my school for the next 10 years. That's where I was: keenly listening to see if we could get the opposition across the line on that funding. They were making that promise and, today, the Prime Minister has the audacity to use that phrase in this space when he is planning $80 billion worth of tax cuts, a handout to big business in this country. That's what he's planning. At the same time, since they came into government five years ago, they have shifted every cost they can back onto the states. They've moved everything that the former Labor government set up as a partnership around education, health and hospitals. There were national partnerships happening. The Commonwealth, under a Labor government, were taking on their fair share of funding those things for Australians. This government, in coming to office, ripped up those arrangements, ripped up those agreements and shifted all of the costs for the future in education and health back onto the states as fast as they could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What that means is that $17 billion in tax cuts will go to the big four banks, exactly the same amount of money that's not going to be given to schools—a clear breach of the no dollar difference. That's not going to go to our schools. They've done that. That is nearly $17 million over two years in my electorate for our schools. Ouch! If I ask the people in my electorate whether they think that the big four banks deserve to have some money put in their pockets or whether they want proper education for their kids, I know what they'll tell me. I stand very proudly behind Labor's decisions here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a little bit of a think about health, because they've done the same in health. We've heard them, day after day in this place, saying: 'We're spending more on health. Please don't mention the National Partnership Agreements that were there beforehand! Please don't mention the cuts! Please don't mention the breach of faith to the states, which did their planning only to have money ripped away from them.' In my community, we have a public hospital, the Werribee Mercy Hospital. It's going through an $80 million rebuild as we speak. Good on state Labor. Good on Daniel Andrews; Tim Pallas, the treasurer, the member for Werribee; and Jill Hennessy, the health minister, the member for Altona. One of her first acts as health minister was to put money into that hospital to rebuild it so that we could have an emergency room, so that we could do emergency surgeries and so that we could have a modern hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But when it comes to the ongoing funding of that hospital and when it comes to paying the salaries of the nurses, the doctors, the cleaners and the people who work in catering, the state's going to be on its own, because this government has walked away from its promises in the National Partnership Agreements. What it means is cuts, cuts, cuts to public hospitals in my state. What it means is that I've got a state government now committed to rebuilding the hospital, but now they have to find the ongoing money to staff it appropriately. They went into a partnership with the federal government and now they find themselves on their own.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've done similar things in the MRI space. Labor committed money to MRIs around this country. I heard the member for Chifley talking about this very point earlier, saying they'd suddenly lost the money in his electorate. Labor has made a commitment for MRI licences, for the full rebate. This government needs to match that commitment, because my area, with 250,000 people, needs access to those MRI machines at the full rebate.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  It's a great pleasure to rise to speak on this MPI, and a good opportunity to set the record straight on a number of misrepresentations and untruths that have just been espoused by the member for Lalor. First of all, this is a member, along with all other members on the other side of this parliament, who told the Australian people that Medicare was going to be privatised—a complete and utter lie. The 'Mediscare' campaign goes down in history as one of the worst lies we've ever seen from Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Australian people, when you hear Labor members open their mouths and make claims, question whether that could possibly true, because Labor has form. The members open their mouths and it's very hard to know whether the truth is being told. We saw that in spades at the last federal election. That is Labor's way. They don't care what they say. They have no regard for integrity. They will say and do whatever it takes to win. Frankly, the Australian people are sick of that. I want to put very clearly on the record and correct the member for Lalor in relation to the unity ticket on the first four years of education funding.</span>

                  </a>  Let me state that it was for the first four years of funding, not six years. That was the unity ticket. The member for Lalor was wrong, wrong, wrong. More misrepresentations. She's also wrong about health funding. Contrary to Labor's lies, funding to public hospitals is at record levels for every state and territory. Our new hospitals agreement, which has now been signed by three Labor and three Liberal state governments, will guarantee funding through to 2025. It's very regrettable that the Labor state government in Victoria, the Daniel Andrews government, has not signed this agreement. As I said, we are delivering record funding to all states. In effect, we are delivering double the funding that was delivered in the last year of the Labor government—double the funding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a day such as today, when we're speaking about Labor's track record, we are very proudly standing here, delivering tax cuts to all Australians and, of course, to all companies. That is our policy. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition made the declaration—a captain's call like no other—that Labor would reverse the tax cuts for companies turning over between $10 million and $50 million. That goes down, I think, in this term of parliament as Labor's biggest stuff-up. There are members opposite who are hanging their heads in embarrassment. We've seen the member for Bass is embarrassed. He knows businesses in his electorate will not cop this from Labor. As I mentioned earlier in my 90-seconder, I've already spoken today to one business owner, in Geelong, who is very concerned about his company, which turns over between $10 million and $50 million, and concerned about the lack of certainty and the impact that this would have if ever Labor were elected. The day before, I spoke to some other owners of small companies in the surf industry, working in the Torquay area, and they also said, 'We are starting to get very, very concerned about these policies.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very proud of what we are doing. We're building a stronger economy, building record jobs growth and delivering GDP growth at 3.1 per cent. In contrast, this appalling Labor opposition has no plan to create one new job. The only plan Labor has is to wreck the economy and to pump up the unions, to pump up their mates, to be beholden to the likes of the CFMEU. Even the AWU has deserted the Labor Party when it comes to Labor's policy on power prices. What we see is an economy-wrecking opposition, and that is why it is so important for all Australians to back the Liberals and Nationals at the next federal election.</span>

                  <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  What a performance we have just seen from the member for Corangamite. It just goes to show that, when the members on the government side are backed into a corner, all we get is some flailing about and some lashing out; don't worry about the accuracy of what's said! Clearly, what we've seen here today is a demonstration of just how wrong the priorities of this government are. Paul Keating famously said, 'If you change the government, you change the nation.' What are we seeing from this government? We are seeing the wrong priorities, and they are not what the Australian people demanded. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I stood for election to this House, and I am sure it is the case for everyone here on the opposition benches—why did we want to come here? We wanted to come to this parliament to represent our communities and stand up for the priorities that they want. When it comes to their priorities, just as the Leader of the Opposition said earlier in this debate, they want to make sure that their health is looked after, they want to make sure that their kids can get a good education and they want to know that their parents and their grandparents will be looked after in aged care. They want to know that their kids will be able to get training, get an apprenticeship and get the skills that they need for a job. They want to ensure that, if they go back into the workforce after having given birth to a child, they can get access to affordable child care and early childhood education. They also want to know that—lo and behold—if the financial services industry and the big banks of this country are not looking after their interests, they will be held to account. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, when we look at the priorities that have been set by this government, what do we see? The failure that is the falsehood of trickle-down economics—voodoo economics. This government's solution to everything is: 'What we will do is give a tax cut to big business. What we'll do is give a tax cut to our mates in the big banks, $17 billion.' Hold that figure in your heads, ladies and gentlemen—$17 billion. It comes up again later. 'We'll give that money out there and hope that it rains down and eventually lands at the feet of ordinary Australians.' That is not the right approach, and it is not what ordinary middle-class Australians and low-income earners want to see. What they want to see is an actual investment in the economy and in their future and their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said to hold onto the number $17 billion, the tax cut that's going to the big banks. Why does that number sound familiar? Oh, that's right: it's the exact same amount of money that this government has decided to cut out of the funding for our schools—the schools that are so essential to make sure that our children are able to get the education they need so that they can get on in a modern economy in a modern society. We know we're having this discussion about automation. We're having the discussion about the future of work. What is going to ensure that Australia prospers and thrives and that our children can get a good job and are able to look after their families? It's about getting a good education. This government's solution to that problem to is cut $17 billion out of funding for our schools. You guys are a mob of geniuses! You really are! Then what do they decide to do in this budget? In this budget they decide to double down and cut money out of TAFE funding: $270 million is being cut from TAFE. We want to make sure that our children and those who want to get ahead in life can get a trade and an apprenticeship and can get the skills they want, and instead this government's solution to that is, 'Oh, we'll just cut funding out of TAFE.' Thanks, guys! A pack of geniuses! Labor, meanwhile, will guarantee the up-front fees for 100,000 places. We will restore the $17 billion that's being cut out of school funding. We'll invest $100 million in a Building TAFE for the Future Fund to make sure that those who want to get ahead can actually get ahead, not through your big business tax cuts and plans to help the banks and the top end of town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got the childcare changes. This one really does my head in, and I'll tell you why: not only have you set up a system which has now disenfranchised a whole heap of working Australians from being able to access child care, but you've now set up a system where they've got to use myGov to go on and re-register to get their rebates. Let me tell you right now: my wife and I have four degrees between us. Two of them are law degrees. The system is broken if we can't make it work the first time around. I have a lot of sympathy for every Australian out there who is trying to rely on the systems this government creates—systems such as robo-debt and trying to get on the phone to talk to Centrelink. Well, good luck with that one!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government has no regard for the needs of ordinary Australians whatsoever. Then what does it decide to do? Rip billions of dollars out of our health system. Thanks! Meanwhile, we need to rely on our hospitals. We need to be able to guarantee we can get access to the health care we need, and this government cuts billions of dollars out of health as well. Then, when it comes to financial services, they rip money out of ASIC, who is supposed to be the big corporate cop on the beat. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I never thought the discussion of the MPI would remind me of the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">The Godfather</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Part II</span>, but this afternoon I am reminded of a scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Godfather Part II</span>. I am reminded of that scene when Frank Pentangeli was going to testify against the mob, and the Corleones wheel his brother in and he changes his testimony. This afternoon, when the member for Bass walked in here in the middle of the MPI—the one member opposite who's not prepared to testify in favour of the Leader of the Opposition's company tax plan—what happened? Well, he was ushered out of the door and into the witness protection program.</span>

                  </a>  And into the re-education camp, as the assistant minister reminds us. This is an extraordinary day to choose to have an MPI on company tax cuts from the Labor Party, because more and more of those opposite are crab-walking away from the Leader of the Opposition's company tax policy. First we had the member for Grayndler in his speech saying that Labor needed to adopt a different attitude towards business. Then we had the member for Bass, who refused to defend the Leader of the Opposition's policy. We have all the Labor MPs who've been backgrounding Simon Benson in News Limited. The company tax policy of the Leader of the Opposition is falling apart, and with good reason: because company tax cuts are important. Company tax cuts are important because they help the economy grow. The difference between those opposite and the government is that we've got a plan to grow the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefit of company tax cuts to this country has been huge. When you combine the company tax cuts with the free trade agreements and the workplace relations changes, you have seen from our government the creation of a million jobs since we came to office in 2013. Last year there was record jobs growth—1,100 jobs every single day. You've seen record low welfare dependency, with only 15 per cent of Australians now on welfare. There has been record low growth in the size of government, too, under the Turnbull government. How has all this happened? This has happened because the economy is strong. How do you create an economy that's strong? You create an economy that's strong by having a plan for growth. Company tax cuts are absolutely vital to that plan for growth and to that economic plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had from the Leader of the Opposition earlier in this debate a list of grievances. I don't doubt that those grievances are true, but we didn't have any solutions to the grievances. We didn't have any solutions that would provide growth and revenue for all the spending programs he wants. Instead, we have a plan from the opposition for $200 billion worth of new taxes, but no plan for growing the economy. Without economic growth, there are no jobs. Without economic growth, there's no money to pay for the schools, the hospitals, the pensions, the NDIS, the child care and all the other spending promises they're interested in. Without economic growth, there's no way of paying for spending on a whole range of things.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do you create economic growth? You create economic growth by backing the people that are having a go—by backing the small, medium and large businesses of Australia who employ people, who take a risk, who try and build a better country and a better economy by taking the risk, and who are creating jobs every single day through what they're doing. Having to pay less tax means that they can take some of the revenue they would have given to the taxman and put it into somebody's job, put it into the expansion of their business or put it into research and development. This is how you grow the economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those ideas seem to have completely escaped those opposite. You can't grow the economy by taxing people. You can only grow the economy by getting off the backs of people who've had a go. The Leader of the Opposition thinks that anyone who runs a business with a turnover of $2,000,001 is running a big business and doesn't deserve a tax cut. Nothing could be further from the truth. I've got 15,000 small businesses in my electorate, and they talk to me about the benefit of the company tax cuts. It's the benefit of being able to give someone a job, the benefit of being able to invest in new plant and equipment, the chance to expand their operation and the chance to expand into new markets.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  The question I want to ask is this: when will the government get the message that, outside of their own personal ideological bubble, the broader Australian community does not want corporate Australia to be handed $80 billion of tax cuts in the hope it will create jobs and secure people's futures whilst cutting schools and hospitals in the process. If the government has been listening at all to the Australian community, it would have noticed that they're fiercely resistant to and downright offended by the prospect that the big end of town, including the banks, will actually put the welfare of the community ahead of their own profits. Revelations in the banking royal commission confirm just how much big business and corporate culture values or cares about the welfare of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my seat of Calwell, we have bitter experiences of the so-called trickle-down economics on which the government repeatedly bases the benefits of its corporate tax cuts. We have seen thousands of jobs lost because big business has taken its business offshore, leaving people unemployed and leaving families in the lurch, from Pacific Brands to Goodyear, Yakka and Autoliv, just to name a few. That's why my constituents aren't buying the government's sales pitch. At a time when they're struggling to make ends meet, this government is prepared to make cuts to vital services in education and health—$17 billion from schools and $715 million from hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each school in my electorate deserves all the resources it can get in order to assist our students to develop to the very best of their abilities. My local schools—public, non-government and in the Catholic school sector—serve a community that varies in socioeconomic status. Our enormous intake of refugees from Syria and Iraq has placed pressure on many of my local public and Catholic schools. Seventy per cent of the students at the Good Samaritan Catholic Primary School in Roxburgh Park are refugees, mostly newly arrived. This is a great school, a compassionate school that is very happy to have the students, but the government's $17 billion cut to schools will further disadvantage its students and our local school community. The Labor Party has its priorities right. Education is vital. It enables and it transforms. That's why we have committed to fully restoring the $17 billion of cuts made by this out-of-touch government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In trying to sell the government's corporate tax cuts for multinationals and big banks, the Prime Minister talks about the importance of investment, but he seems to be oblivious to the fact that directly investing in education and skills, especially in TAFE, will reap greater benefits for my constituents and for all Australians. It's the people, Prime Minister. Investing in our people should be our priority. Since coming to government in 2013, the Liberals have cut more than $3 billion from skills, training and apprentices. Today there are 140,000 fewer apprentices than there were when they took office. The 2018 budget saw a further cut of $270 million from TAFE and training. There are 41,000 fewer trade apprentices in training, while employer groups are reporting shortages in trades and technical occupations, particularly in construction and engineering. These are opportunities for training and employment pathways that my constituents, especially the young people in my electorate, are missing out on. The government should prioritise skilling and educating Australians rather than lining the pockets of big business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because Labor will not be giving multinationals and the big banks an $80 billion tax cut, we can afford to invest in our people, in the Australian people. Giving Australians an affordable and real opportunity should be our priority, not leaving them dependent on the wing and a prayer of trickle-down economics. We will waive up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places, we will guarantee at least two-thirds of public vocational education funding for TAFE, and we will invest in a new $100 million Building TAFE for the Future Fund to revitalise TAFE campuses and facilities in regional and outer metropolitan areas. This is great news and will be very welcomed by my constituents, because it means that the Kangan Institute, our local TAFE, will be able to rebuild its capacity, having endured so many cuts that recently it had to close its library. This government needs to understand that investing in our people is— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's fantastic that we've been given the opportunity to address some of Labor's lies and deception. What better time to debate the merits of taxation policy than when all of Australia has just recently learned that the Leader of the Opposition is now waging a war against the business community? The Leader of the Opposition talks big about big business and why the private sector doesn't deserve tax relief, but we on this side know what he considers to be big business. Now we know—aha! The secret is out. Now we know that any company with an annual turnover of more than $10 million is big business. But there's more, to our surprise. Possibly a big business could also have a turnover of $2 million. There is more to come on that, I'm sure. We know that, if those opposite ever get the chance, they will repeal that legislation that we have recently introduced.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put that into perspective. If Labor gets into government, the 17,000 businesses in my electorate of Durack will pay higher taxes. Make no mistake: farmers, horticulturalists, retailers, boatbuilders and even the crayfishermen—or women, I should say—will all pay more tax, because that's what Labor thinks they deserve. Those that I have just mentioned are all small businesses, they're all family businesses, and they are the engine room of our economy. Labor's policies will see that engine grind to a halt. It's incredible when you think that the last time Labor were in government—a dark time; a nightmare at times—the Leader of the Opposition stood in this very chamber and told the country how wonderful it would be to lower the company tax rate. We know deep down he believes our policy is the right way to manage the economy. He knows it creates jobs and encourages Australians to have a go. In 2011 he pretty much said so:</span>

Every time they say something, you have to bear in mind that they cannot be trusted. You must always question it, because they cannot be believed. There are no cuts to school funding; in fact we're delivering record funding for Australian schools. In my electorate more than 23,000 students are enrolled across 131 public schools, so I know a little bit about school funding, because I have a lot of students and a lot of schools. This year those schools in Durack will receive funding of $91.8 million from those sitting on this side of the chamber. In 2027 those schools will receive a share of $163 million in federal funds. The funding per student will jump from $3,900 this year to nearly $7,000 over the next 10 years. Let's be clear: that's up, not down.</span>

                  </a>  It's nice to see how the students in the gallery are all smiling. They might even be from Durack. My electorate has some of the most remote schools and, more than that, some of the most disadvantaged students in the country. Only the coalition is going to put money in the right places, into the schools where the students need our support the most.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about what the other side would do. They talk big about school money, but we can guarantee there would be special deals like there have been for those inner city schools in Melbourne and Sydney. You can guarantee that there would be no special deal for any child in my electorate, in the regional and remote areas of Australia. We're not going to sell out those kids—no way! We're going to make sure there are no backroom deals, so that our kids in remote and regional parts of Australia get the support they need. We know that those opposite cannot be trusted to deliver for Australia. They cannot be trusted to encourage and support businesses, whether big or small. We heard that today. The Leader of the Opposition can't even be trusted to consult his own party.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  I thank everyone for their contributions—sadly, we're missing a contribution from the member for Bass—and all stakeholders who contributed to the development of the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Productivity Commission Response Part 1 and Other Measures) Bill 2018. This bill represents extensive public consultation over a number of years, including from the Productivity Commission, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, and IP Australia. The government heard from a wide range of stakeholders, from individual intellectual property academics to legal practitioners in the attorney profession, from small nurseries to major agricultural operations, from small, innovative businesses to large Australian firms operating globally. The government values each and every one of these contributions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The continuing success of the Australian economy will depend on our ability to be innovative, productive and competitive in the global marketplace. The intellectual property system is an important part of the economy because it promotes and incentivises investment in creativity, innovation, research and technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill delivers on the Turnbull government's commitment to review and reform our IP arrangements. In 2015, we asked the Productivity Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the IP system, including copyright, trademarks, patents designs and plant breeder's rights. The government responded to the Productivity Commission's recommendations in August last year. This bill therefore contains the first suite of changes to ensure that our IP laws provide an appropriate balance between access to ideas and products and encouraging innovation, investment and the production of creative works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed legislation will bring a number of benefits. It will reduce uncertainty for importers of trademarked goods, which will ultimately strengthen competition and benefit consumers. It will strengthen plant breeders' protections to more effectively deal with anyone who, unfairly, freely rides on their innovative efforts. It will reduce barriers to competition, with fewer unused trademarks on the register, which will also increase our alignment with international standards. It will improve the protection that owners of IP rights have against unjustified threats, which will help level the playing field. The proposed legislation will also streamline and modernise aspects of the Australian intellectual property system, reducing barriers and regulatory costs for Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also draw the House's attention to the report on the bill by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which was released on 22 June. The committee noted the extensive consultation that I referred to that has gone into developing the bill, and commended IP Australia on its thoughtful response to the public consultation on the exposure draft legislation. Accordingly, the committee did not propose any amendments and unanimously recommended that the bill be passed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, therefore, in the light of that endorsement: the IP system, in our view, is vital to the strength of the Australian economy because it encourages invention and investment in new technologies, products and markets. A good IP system must provide appropriate incentives for Australian businesses to innovate, but it also must be balanced to ensure that all Australians are able to benefit from innovation and competition. This bill is an important step in enhancing Australia's IP system so that it can ultimately better support innovation and growth in this country, and therefore I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="140590" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I'm sure most of the members in the House have a similar experience to mine when they go around the country and talk to Australians about what happens here in our parliament. The public see a parliament that's very divided, where we spend most of our time, according to them, yelling at each other across the chamber. That is what goes on a little bit in this House, but we have a lot of legislation that actually goes through this House with the agreement of all the political parties that are represented in the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been quite hard work to get the bill before us, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers, Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2017, to a point where Labor was supportive of it. There were some big issues, particularly with regard to custody notification, which is an area that protects Indigenous rights and Indigenous Australians who have been incarcerated for various reasons. But I have to say that we've worked with the Public Service and the government cooperatively and come to what I think is a good bill, and it's a bill that Labor will be supporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers, Offences and Other Measures) Bill before us relates to a range of changes to our criminal justice system. It includes the Australian Federal Police's abilities to cooperate with international organisations, the disclosure of information in the context of controlled operations, custody notification and the protection of vulnerable witnesses. It's a bill that demonstrates the commitment of both sides of Australian politics to keeping Australians safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill would amendment the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, to enable the AFP to assist or cooperate with an international organisation or a non-government organisation outside Australia in relation to the provision of police services or police support services. In plain English, what we're talking about here is the fact that crime in our community is becoming very transnational. In the discussions I have with law enforcement, they're continually raising this issue with me. Many crimes—whether it is fraud, child exploitation or human trafficking and slavery, all the things that the AFP in particular deal with—are starting to have a transnational aspect. This means that the Australian Federal Police must be able to work effectively with international organisations. According to the Australian Federal Police, somewhere around 70 per cent of our serious criminal threats now have an international dimension. Allowing the AFP to assist organisations overseas is a sensible change and Labor will support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, laws are very important to the prevention of crime, but they don't mean too much to Australians if they're not properly enforced. Alongside a commitment to continue to strengthen the law that supports the work that the AFP does, that same commitment needs to be extended by the government to the resourcing of the Australian Federal Police. Last month at Senate estimates, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police confirmed that the government's most recent budget contains a $205 million cut to resourcing of the Australian Federal Police over the forward estimates. We're pleased to see a bill like this that provides opportunities for the AFP to do its work more seamlessly around the world, but—I say again—it's not much good when the AFP is seeing its staff and budget cut by this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AFP commissioner in Senate estimates was able to confirm that staffing at the AFP is predicted to fall from 6,448 personnel in 2018-19, to 5,881 personnel in 2021-22. That is a pretty extraordinary reduction of 567 cops over the next four years, and I am very concerned to see the government implementing that reduction. Labor will support this aspect of the bill and the measures it contains to assist the Australian Federal Police, but we do remain really concerned about the ability of this organisation to do work that is growing in importance and, I have to say, growing in magnitude because of the some of the threats that we face as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill would increase the maximum penalty for breaches of the general dishonesty offences contained in the Criminal Code. That increase would see the maximum penalty go from five years imprisonment to 10 years imprisonment. The rationale behind the change is we believe a good one; it is to align the sentencing of dishonesty offences with similar offences contained in the Criminal Code, and we absolutely believe the courts need the flexibility to give stronger penalties to serious crimes like this. There was a concern raised in the Senate committee process, and one that Labor shared, which was about increasing maximum penalties. One of the ways this parliament can give a message to our justice system, to the court system, is by raising the maximum penalty. That can sometimes indicate to the judiciary that we believe that sentencing generally for this particular crime is not enough. That's not why this law is being changed today. We were pleased to receive confirmation from the government that it will be made clear by the minister that the intention of increasing the maximum penalty in this instance is not to target offenders at the lower level of offending; it is to target people at the very upper end of offending, who would be receiving a longer jail sentence if they were convicted under a similar but different federal law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legal Aid New South Wales was one of the organisations that engaged very constructively in the Senate committee process and they were very concerned about this change, prior to the clarification being received. They argued that increasing the penalties for these offences would disproportionately and unfairly impact on vulnerable people being prosecuted for social security fraud. I met with the government and raised these concerns. We are pleased that the minister has clarified that, in his summing up speech, he will make it clear that it's not parliament's intention that the maximum penalty be placed on the lower level of offending for this offence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn now to the crucially important aspect of the bill before us, which is some changes that have been made to the custody notifications scheme in the Crimes Act. Custody notification is a crucial way that we manage what is a far too high incidence of incarceration of Aboriginal Australians. Custody notification requirements ensure that law enforcement let lawyers know when they question a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin in custody. We know that custody notification saves lives. We're very lucky on this side of the House to have Senator Patrick Dodson, who is in the other place. He has been engaged in this question of the incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians for many, many decades—for longer than I have been alive. He was part of the royal commission that initially looked into Aboriginal deaths in custody, and the custody notification that exists under Australian law today came, in part, through a recommendation of that royal commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The change that has been suggested in the bill seeks to amend a drafting error that was in our Commonwealth custody notification obligations. It came to light through a case that went through the ACT court system, a 2013 case called R v CK. What that showed was that investigating officials under the technical reading of this law were actually not required to notify an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation before they commenced questioning. It became apparent that there was this ambiguity about the exact timing of when an Aboriginal legal organisation had to be notified and whether the Indigenous person had to be held for the duration of their wait for a lawyer. Would a phone call at two o'clock in the morning that left a voice mail, for example, suffice under the act? Labor took a pretty strong view on this. We want to make it absolutely certain that Indigenous people who are incarcerated have all of their rights adequately protected. That's why we sat down with the government and tried to, in a really substantial way, look at amendments that could make this area of law much clearer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Custody notification schemes can't be watered down, and I am very pleased with the fact that the government has agreed to make some big changes to this area of the bill. Labor senators were able to draft additional comments which outlined Labor's concerns with the bill as originally drafted, and we can see that the minister has made amendments to the bill that will go through the House and that will ensure that absolute notification requirements remain in the bill. I think it's really good news. It's great to have this area of the law clarified. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to people again: you see a lot of frustrations in this parliament, but here we have a legislative process that is actually working properly. The government did want to make changes to custody notifications. I don't think there is anyone in this parliament who doesn't agree there are issues with Indigenous incarceration rates and the treatment of Aboriginal people in jail. We certainly, as a parliament, don't want to be making that problem worse. There are many things we could be doing to make it better, but, certainly, we don't want to make the problem worse, and I'm pleased to see that the bill before us won't do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT), the Law Council of Australia, Legal Aid New South Wales, the Australian Human Rights Commission and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services for their work fighting for the retention of these important obligations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say a couple of things about why custody notification matters so much. I think most Australians are aware that there is massive over-representation of first nation Australians in jails around Australia. In 1991, first nation Australians constituted 14 per cent of our prison population. In 2017, 25 years later, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners accounted for 27 per cent of the total Australian prisoner population. That is a national crisis and a national tragedy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very lucky to have next to me the member for Barton, one of our nation's foremost First Nations leaders. This is something that we are acutely aware of. We need to do more as a parliament to try to arrest this problem. There is a major issue if a community represents somewhere around three or five—or a little bit more—per cent of our population but a quarter of all Australian prisoners. There is something utterly wrong with how we are managing this area of policy and this very important population of people who represent the oldest living culture in the world. There's more that we as Australians can do to show our pride in that culture, to recognise the extraordinary generosity of First Australians in their willingness to share their culture with us, but we need to change the tone of how we've approached this problem. To see issues like Indigenous incarceration get worse over the last 25 years—and get worse when so many people have, I think, with full hearts tried to address some of these issues—means we really need to stop and have a think about how we're doing things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I know the member for Barton has been showing huge leadership on, nationally and within our caucus, is the importance of giving Indigenous Australians a voice in the national conversation about issues that affect them. When I look at the problem of Indigenous incarceration, when I look at some of the other issues that First Nations people face, I see that we must provide the leadership this community needs—provide them with a platform and a voice to tell us what they want us to focus on and how we're going to work our way out of some of these issues—because what we've done to date is clearly not working, when 25 per cent of all Australians in jail are First Australians. It's not good enough, and we need to do a lot more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, I want to briefly touch on schedule 6 of the bill before us, which would strengthen the protections for vulnerable people in part IAD of the Crimes Act—for example, child witnesses and vulnerable adult complainants giving evidence in particular criminal proceedings. Vulnerable witnesses and complainants are often giving evidence regarding truly shocking crimes. The federal Crimes Act deals with some of the most heinous human rights violations, and often those violations are done to people who are incredibly vulnerable, who are dependents or children. It's critically important that we provide people who are willing to testify against their perpetrators with every protection that we can through the criminal justice process. Labor is absolutely committed to protecting vulnerable witnesses. In government, Labor passed the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Law Enforcement Integrity, Vulnerable Witness Protection and Other Measures) Act 2013. The measures in the bill before us will build on these reforms, and Labor is very proud to be supporting them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I'm not going to speak too long on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers, Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2017. I want to stand to reiterate and reaffirm the comments made by the member for Hotham, the shadow minister for justice, particularly around the bipartisanship shown in this process and in many of the processes around law enforcement. As the shadow minister for justice mentioned, Labor supported this bill with some very important amendments. It is an omnibus bill, which does several things. I won't go through all of them, but I want to focus on a few. The first one of those is the recognition of the importance of the Australian Federal Police in international cooperation, particularly around serious and organised crime. Serious and organised crime is becoming increasingly transnational, and our very top-notch and very capable law enforcement here in Australia has a strong role to play regionally in stopping international and transnational crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just give you an example of how this kind of crime works. It is also particularly important to have regional and international cooperation in an era of new and emerging communications technologies, where criminals are taking advantage of that. They're able to coordinate using the dark web and encryption services across and between countries. An example of that was an Indonesian terror cell that used cryptocurrencies. First of all, they used some hacking devices to obtain the credit card information of people in one country, and then they sold that credit card information to people in third and fourth countries for cryptocurrencies. With this kind of technology-enabled crime, they managed to raise US$600,000 for a potential terrorist attack. That's just one example, but it highlights the importance of having a well-equipped law enforcement agency that can work internationally in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow minister for justice quite eloquently mentioned, law enforcement is not just a matter of having a strong legislative framework; it's also very important that agencies are well resourced. Their capabilities are also very important. So this is about not just putting in place the legislative framework that enables law enforcement agencies to do the kind of work that they need to but ensuring that they are fully resourced and have the capabilities in order to ensure that as well. When funding is cut, that capability is compromised, and the work that they are able to do in stopping international and transnational serious and organised crime through these cooperative measures that are outlined in this bill is also compromised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to speak about another important amendment—again, reiterating what our shadow minister for justice said. That important amendment is on the custody notification issue. The bill alters the custody notification obligations of investigation officials when they intend to question an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person. As originally drafted, before we worked through these amendments in a bipartisan fashion as we did, the bill would actually have removed the absolute requirement to notify an Aboriginal legal aid organisation. The intent should have been to amend a drafting error that was brought to light in a case that the previous speaker mentioned It was a drafting error in the Crimes Act that, in effect, meant that investigating officials were not required to notify an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation or person before commencing questioning. This meant that the custody notification rules, which were originally intended to be an absolute requirement to notify, would have been scaled back to a requirement to take reasonable steps to notify and then a two-hour wait. The shadow minister for justice highlighted some of the difficulties with having reasonable steps and what qualifies as reasonable steps and then a two-hour wait.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As stakeholders noted, there are many reasons why an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation may not be able to respond immediately to a notification, so these proposed changes might have left individuals without those very important protections. What would have happened, had the bill gone through without the amendments that were recommended, is a watering-down of the notification provisions of the Crimes Act, which should protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. So we're very happy that that didn't happen, that the amendments that we suggested were worked through, again, in a bipartisan manner and that those changes were made. We proposed amendments to protect the absolute obligation to notify an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation, and we called on the government to implement nationwide custody notification services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to mention and add something here that's not in the bill but that I think has been an issue, in particular for Western Australia but also around Australia. In the circumstances of the arrest and incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, an issue has been access to interpreting services. There has been a lack of qualifications in determining whether or not somebody needs an interpreting service in a justice environment, an assumption that if somebody speaks English then they can comprehend and perform within a justice environment and a misunderstanding of the actual standards that would require access to an interpreting service. Apart from that, in Western Australia there has been a decimation of the Aboriginal translating and interpreting service. If we're talking about notifications and if we are looking at a more comprehensive approach, I think it's very important to mention here in this debate the need for more access to interpreting and translating services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly in justice settings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains a number of other measures. I won't go through all of them, but it does contain strengthened protections for vulnerable witnesses and complainants in Commonwealth criminal proceedings in the Crime Act. I will just mention that Labor are committed to protection for the vulnerable. In government we passed the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Law Enforcement Integrity, Vulnerable Witness Protection and Other Measures) Act in 2013. That provided protection for vulnerable witnesses giving evidence in proceedings for Commonwealth criminal offences and a scheme to enable the use of victim impact statements in the sentencing of federal offenders. We were proud to build on that wonderful work that we did in 2013 and support these additional protections as they are in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill creates separate offence regimes for insiders and outsiders for the disclosure of information relating to controlled operations in the Crimes Act. The terms 'insiders' and 'outsiders' do not refer to separate television shows on two different networks—just to be clear! The intention of these amendments was to bring AFP-controlled operations in line with the offences for disclosure of ASIO special intelligence operations, which makes sense. The changes in schedule 3 will mirror section 35P of the ASIO Act, which was amended in 2015 to introduce lesser penalties for outsiders than for insiders who disclose ASIO special intelligence operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other measures. Considering this is the third reading debate, I won't go into them. But I will just close by again reiterating the importance of a couple of things—the first being bipartisan support, particularly on law enforcement. We are happy with this bill and we're proud to support this bill, given the amendments that were recommended and the acceptance of those amendments. That's the first thing I want to highlight. The second thing is just to reiterate again the importance of legislative reform that allows law enforcement to do its job and keep in mind and keep an eye on ensuring that they also have the capabilities to take advantage of a robust legislative framework. Those capabilities are intrinsically tied to resourcing and to the level of funding that we give to our Federal Police. I commend our law enforcement agencies. They do a wonderful job. But, increasingly, they are asked to do that job with fewer and fewer resources.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I, too, won't take too much time, given that agreement has been reached on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers, Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2017. I commend the minister, as well as the shadow minister, on working in a bipartisan fashion to deliver the best results as it applies to law enforcement. I spent many years prior to entering this place representing the interests of police officers, state and federal. So I take an interest in issues of law enforcement generally. The bill before us is an omnibus bill that covers many, many things. I was initially going to speak about two aspects of this bill—namely schedule 2, in terms of the issues of notification when wishing to question or when arresting persons of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage; and schedule 3 of the bill, dealing with insider and outsider disclosures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of schedule 2, we have a very strong view—which I'm very happy to say the minister has now embraced—about notification being mandatory. By the way, the mandatory notifications in respect of the questioning of Aboriginal persons came out of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, so there was not any prospect that we saw of watering down those provisions. There would be no utility in it and no practical purpose. It would, regrettably, cause us to bring ourselves back into disrepute by flying in the face of the commissioner's recommendation coming out of that royal commission. So I'm glad that that has been resolved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second aspect that I wanted to speak a little on was controlled operations. Having represented police at both state and federal levels, I've been particularly involved in controlled operations, and many aspects had to be negotiated over a long period of time. At one stage, controlled operations were a little footloose and fancy free, without providing the proper protection for officers. Fortunately, that has now long since been remedied. But the issue of disclosure does raise some concern. The bill creates the new offences of insider- and outsider-initiated disclosures. Within the law enforcement community, we would take a very dim view of an insider disclosing any aspect of a controlled operation. The bill would make a distinction between that and—I know this has been negotiated between the government and the opposition—for instance, a journalist reporting in the public interest on a police-controlled operation or a police operation by the AFP. Making that distinction in the provision of schedule 3, I think, is a good thing and one which I would support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When talking about policing, we inevitably start talking about police resourcing. It is of concern that the Australian Federal Police commissioner, Commissioner Colvin, at the last Senate estimates was able to confirm a $205 million cut to resourcing for the AFP over the forward estimates. Any cut to the resourcing of law enforcement should be a concern to everyone; not just to those who wear the uniform. According to the AFP predictions, that would mean a fall in personnel from 6,448 in this financial year to 5,881 in 2021-22. That's an extraordinary reduction in AFP staff of 567—I'm not saying that's 567 police officers, it's also staff of the AFP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is coupled with the fact that the government has taken almost 2½ years to resolve a wages deal for those on the thin blue line. Police officers of the AFP have waited 2½ years in truncated negotiations to resolve a wages deal. It is right that we regard our police highly. The men and women who are prepared to put themselves into harm's way need all the support we can give them. It is also right that they should be heavily scrutinised, because we are going to continually give more and more powers to police. They support that level of increased scrutiny, more so than anyone else in public life. Yet when it comes to wages, they are treated vastly differently. The government waited 2½ years to settle a wage claim for police officers. These are the people that we put on the frontline, the people who are on shifts from one day to the next, with the preparedness to put their lives on the line for the benefit of fellow Australians, and we treat them like that. I think that is thoroughly reprehensible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I briefly take the opportunity to advise the House that we are approaching the inaugural Police Week, which will be in September this year. The event aims to draw the policing community together to participate in honour of those officers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, and also to celebrate the wonderful work being done by police officers and law enforcement generally throughout the country. Australia's Police Week 2018 will draw together supporters of policing from across every state and territory in a range of formal and informal activities. It is envisaged that Police Week will become a major event on the law enforcement calendar in the future. While the focus will be on the National Police Memorial in Canberra from 15 to 29 September, jurisdictions across the country will also be holding very separate and specific events in their own states and territories. One such event is the Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance, which will see over 2,000 police officers and their supporters from around Australia participate in a motorcycle ride en masse to the nation's capital, ending at the National Police Memorial in Kings Park on 15 September this year. This will be the second year that I haven't actually participated in that ride, for reasons that members would no doubt appreciate, but it is a very significant event. It is now in its ninth year. It's to remember fallen colleagues, to raise money for police charities, particularly Police Legacy, and to promote safe and legal motorcycling. To date we have raised over $800,000 for Police Legacy through our participation in that event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also advise the House that the fourth annual National Policing Summit will also be held during Police Week, on 17 and 18 September at the Hyatt Hotel. The summit will bring together police from every jurisdiction, along with various government departments and agencies, and strategic analysts, to discuss a range of police reforms and service delivery issues in a rapidly changing law enforcement space. I would also like draw the attention of the House to the inaugural National Police Bravery Awards. They will be held in Canberra on 19 September at the National Museum. The National Police Bravery Awards will recognise exceptional acts of bravery undertaken by the country's serving police officers. The awards will be specifically developed as an award to police officers recognised by fellow police officers, transcending all states and jurisdictional divides, making the recipients truly recognised as national heroes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we will have the 22nd annual Police Federation of Australia council meeting in Canberra on 20 and 21 September. One of the key aspects of the council's meeting this year is police officers' mental wellbeing. Last year the PFA was able to access a proceeds of crime grant to help educate officers and those around them of the risks and the early warning signs to support police officers with mental health issues. Despite all the advances that have been made in this space, there's a lot more work that needs to be done, particularly in raising awareness, in understanding, in prevention and in destigmatising mental health in law enforcement. A major thrust is to break down the stigma attached to emotional illnesses and for officers to feel more comfortable about being able to come forward and advise their superiors when they have an issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday, 28 September, National Police Remembrance Day observances will be held around the country, and specifically at the National Police Memorial here in Canberra. It's an opportunity for all of us to show our support for police officers and our support for not only those who have made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf but also those who are prepared to go to work day in, day out and face danger at our expense.  I've learnt over a long period of time that it takes a special type of person with a special type of bravery to wear the police uniform, and we are extremely indebted to those who choose to do so. They are prepared to face dangers that, thankfully, most of us will never have to encounter. For those who are prepared to wear the police uniform, we should take the opportunity this September to show that we honour and respect them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate on this bill, which will make significant improvements to Commonwealth criminal justice arrangements. The bill has been considered in detail by several parliamentary committees. I thank those committees for their contributions and confirm that the government has amended the explanatory memorandum and the bill to implement recommendations emanating from committee consideration of the bill. I also take the opportunity to thank the opposition for their cooperation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will bolster the Commonwealth's ability to combat fraud and corruption. The measures in the bill will enable the Commonwealth to gather necessary personal information to clamp down on corrupt officials and those who defraud the Commonwealth. Personal information will be able to be collected and disclosed to or within the Commonwealth and where it is necessary for an integrity purpose. These measures are appropriate and contain appropriate safeguards to protect privacy. The amendments only apply to serious misconduct or substantial fraud and require that any guidelines made on the operation of the measures be approved by the Information Commissioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the sections of the Crimes Act dealing with offences for disclosing information relating to controlled operations. These amendments will reduce restrictions placed on ordinary citizens, introducing new elements that must be proven before a member of the community can be convicted of a disclosure offence. The government understands the importance of maintaining public awareness of and confidence in the activities of our law enforcement agencies. The decision to provide additional protections for members of the community demonstrates our commitment to achieving the right balance between freedom of expression and our national security and law enforcement requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has amended the explanatory memorandum to clarify the intended interaction between the Commonwealth controlled operation offences and state and territory offences, in response to a recommendation published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> that considered the bill. The bill clarifies the timing of the requirement that investigating officials who intend to question an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander in relation to a Commonwealth or ACT offence must contact an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation before starting their questioning. This will give full effect to a recommendation of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody upon which the relevant provision in the Commonwealth Crimes Act is based. This was always the original intention of the legislative requirement, but was cast into doubt by an ACT Supreme Court case. The bill will end this uncertainty and will strengthen an important protection for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in custody. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will introduce amendments to remove the 'reasonable steps' requirement in response to concerns expressed in submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The bill also strengthens the Commonwealth's vulnerable witness protections. The bill will introduce amendments requiring that applicants seeking leave from the court to publish matters likely to identify vulnerable persons must notify relevant parties to the original proceeding prior to that application being heard. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will increase the maximum penalty for general dishonesty offences in the Criminal Code from five years imprisonment to 10 years imprisonment. This will ensure that the courts have the ability to address high-level offending that falls within the parameters of these offences. It will also ensure that penalties for criminal conduct of a similar nature are consistent across the Criminal Code. This amendment was a key recommendation from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the Senate committee inquiry into penalties for white-collar crime, which reported in 2017. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to concerns raised in submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, this will not have a disproportionate effect on welfare recipients who have been charged with minor fraud offences. Increasing the maximum penalty will allow judges to address higher level offending. It does not follow that higher sentences will be imposed on lower level offending. The bill will expand the functions of the Australian Federal Police to enable them to provide assistance and facilitate cooperation with international organisations and non-government organisations in relation to the provision of police services or police support services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will ensure that the AFP can exchange information with international organisations made up of multiple member countries—for example, the International Criminal Court, ad hoc international war crimes tribunals and Interpol. The amendments ensure the AFP can cooperate effectively with requests for assistance from international organisations in response to an increasingly global criminal threat. The government has amended the explanatory memorandum to include further analysis of the privacy implications of these amendments, responding to a recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The bill also amends the Commonwealth's spent convictions regime to remove impediments that currently prevent the New South Wales Law Enforcement Conduct Commission from using spent convictions information to vet employees and investigate serious misconduct and corruption in particular circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee recommended that, subject to the government elaborating on two issues in explanatory materials, the bill be passed. The government has tabled a further addendum to the explanatory memorandum, and government amendments to address the committee's recommendations. This bill has clearly been considered in detail and, as a result, represents a balanced approach to amending our criminal justice frameworks and practices. This bill will strengthen Australia's criminal justice framework and provide our law enforcement agencies with the tools and powers they need to do their job. It will ensure Commonwealth laws, as well as protections and safeguards, are robust and effective.</span>

They're actually quite crucial. The bill as it was originally drafted would have altered the content of our federal custody notification scheme from an absolute requirement to notify an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation to an obligation to take 'reasonable steps' to notify an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation and provide a two-hour window for that organisation to contact the individual to be questioned. That sounds very technical, but what we're really talking about is what are the obligations on police when they want to question a person who is of First Nations heritage. It is crucially important that an Aboriginal legal service be notified so they can provide support to a First Nations person who needs legal assistance. That's the amendment that's before us and that's what's being clarified here in the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our parliament at work. The committee process flushed out these issues. We had experts on our side of the House who have been working in this area for decades who were able to provide some historical aspect to what was going on here. Labor went to the government and asked for amendments to be made, and the government in good faith made those amendments. So I'm pleased support what's before the House now.</span>

These government amendments will amend schedule 2 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers, Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2017, which concerns the existing custody notification obligation in the Commonwealth Crimes Act. The custody notification obligation applies to investigating officials when they have arrested and detained an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander for the purpose of questioning them about an offence. The bill as originally introduced would have amended subsection 23H(1) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act to require investigating officials to take reasonable steps to notify an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation in these circumstances. The government's intention with the bill in its original form was to clarify what was required of investigating officials to discharge the obligation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee has considered the bill and recommended that the term 'reasonable steps' be further explained in the explanatory materials. After careful consideration, the government has decided to move amendments to remove the term entirely. The amendments will still make clear that investigating officials must notify an Aboriginal legal assistance organisation before commencing questioning. I thank the committee and the important community stakeholders for their consideration of the bill in detail.</span>

The Underwater Cultural Heritage Bill 2018 replaces the framework established by the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. This bill provides for the identification, protection and conservation of Australia's important underwater cultural heritage, including historic shipwrecks, submerged aircraft and human remains, along with their fragile natural environments. The bill implements our national and international maritime heritage responsibilities and also promotes public awareness and appropriate use of the Australia's underwater cultural heritage. The bill will update the original aims as laid out in the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 to maintain compliance with modern standards of regulatory compliance and enforcement.</span>

The Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 was last amended in 1985. It's a solid legislative framework, but it does not account for the changes in Australian and international law after the ratification of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1994. New international laws and agreements include the rights and obligations extended to states in that convention that were not outlined in the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill triggers parts of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, providing for monitoring and investigative powers and enforcement provisions, including civil penalties and infringement notices. Contraventions of the act will be regulated more strictly to reflect the extensive national cultural legacy of Australia's underwater cultural heritage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an expansion of the protective scope of the bill. This includes replacement of terms referring to 'shipwrecks' and 'wrecks' with terms referring to 'underwater cultural heritage'. This also includes articles that appear to have been constructed or used by a person associated with a vessel, providing for the protection of secondary heritage sites such as shipwreck, survivor or salvage camps. Certain articles of underwater cultural heritage are automatically protected, in contrast to the previous ministerial approach under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. The minister may still declare articles to be protected, but they will now be assessed against prescribed significance criteria. Automatic protection means that important artefacts and wrecks won't be easily missed or left unprotected for long periods of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the bill does not seek to assert sovereignty over waters that are not considered Australian under international law, it will also include a clause to protect Australian underwater crucial heritage articles located outside of Australian waters, such as one of Australia's first submarines, the <span style="font-style:italic;">AE2</span>, which lies in the ocean off the Turkish coast. The bill also includes provisions to limit and regulate the possession and movement of underwater cultural heritage material that has been removed from Australian waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows the importance of our heritage, our environment and our Australian stories. Conservation of heritage is critical for maintaining Australian stories, culture and history. In 2012 the wrecks of the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Lexington</span>, known affectionately to her crew as Lady Lex, the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sims</span> and the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Neosho</span>, which all sunk during the Battle of the Coral Sea, were announced as protected historic shipwrecks under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 by the then heritage minister, Tony Burke. This announcement acknowledged the exceptional heritage significance of the wrecks in the Coral Sea, and ensured that the Battle of the Coral Sea will continue to be recognised. These wrecks are of important historical significance and serve as a physical reminder of the events that took place in the Pacific in World War II. The bill guarantees that any action that could result in damage, interference, removal or destruction of these historically significant wrecks or their associated relics is against the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lady Lex was bombed down in May of 1942 during the Battle of the Coral Sea, and 2,735 crew were evacuated and 216 of her crew were killed. The Battle of the Coral Sea winded the Imperial Japanese Navy's attacks on Australia after they had previously killed 236 Australians in the bombings of Darwin earlier that year. The Battle of the Coral Sea claimed the lives of more than 500 Allied forces from the US and Australia, 66 US aircraft and three warships. These historical moments are integral to Australia's story and allow us to reflect on the wartime experiences of the Australians involved, while commemorating the first joint military action between Australia and the United States. Preserving these underwater wrecks is a thankyou to an incredibly brave and resilient generation of Australians, whether they contributed via air, on our seas or by helping out on home soil. Once these wrecks and relics are lost, they can never be recovered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cultural history of the Coral Sea is unique, as is the environmental value of the Coral Sea. It is worth putting on the record that, whilst Labor supports this bill, we oppose the marine parks plan that the government is proposing in the Coral Sea and other marine areas—a plan that will remove massive amounts of ocean protection. Just like Labor is committed to conserving our culture and history, we are committed to conserving our natural environment. Removing protections in the Coral Sea is the biggest step backwards in conservation anywhere in the world. The Coral Sea is a world-famous site for diving, has unique reefs and is known to be a turtle highway. Removing around 50 per cent of the marine national parks in the Coral Sea, which is what the conservative government is proposing, will see areas open to longlining and midwater trawling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Parramatta is landlocked, yet every time the Coral Sea or marine parks are mentioned we receive hundreds of contacts from people—landlocked Aussies who are incredibly concerned about the health of our oceans. I suspect that all of my colleagues on both sides in landlocked electorates receive the same kinds of responses. Labor won't stand by and see the ocean protection legacy created in 2012 destroyed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a continuation of the policy framework of the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. It gives clarity to the present and ongoing jurisdictional arrangements for protecting and managing Australia's underwater cultural heritage. For the first time, this bill recognises human remains in addition to other articles found within shipwrecks or sunken aircraft. It enables protection of Australia's underwater cultural heritage located outside jurisdictional waters and broadens protection to sunken aircraft and other sites. The bill elevates the role of the public by recognising the need to promote awareness, understanding, appreciation and appropriate use of Australia's underwater cultural heritage. This bill, in conjunction with the associated Underwater Cultural Heritage (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, ensures that the discovery, protection and management of underwater culture heritage in Australia will be effective and proportionate. The bill modernises and strengthens the range of investigation and enforcement powers with a graduated approach to compliance, and it continues the highly successful delegated framework for day-to-day management.</span>

The approximately 7,500 historic shipwrecks, sunken aircraft and other underwater cultural heritage sites in Australian and Commonwealth waters are physical evidence of our past. The bill will support the continuing protection of the culture inheritance for future generations, and will position us to participate in the global community's response to threats to underwater cultural heritage. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  Labor supports this bill. It helps to clarify, correct and strengthen Australia's consumer protection and product safety regime, and Labor has always backed measures that help and protect Australian consumers. Labor introduced the Trade Practices Act in 1974, the first consumer protection legislation for our nation, and Labor created the Australian Consumer Law, the ACL, in 2010. The federal Labor government, in negotiating the 2009 intergovernmental agreement on Australia's consumer protection arrangements which preceded the ACL, built in a requirement that the new laws be reviewed within seven years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to implement some of the recommendations of that review. The ACL Review was commissioned in 2015, issued an interim report in December 2016, and submitted its final report to federal, state and territory consumer affairs ministers in March 2017. At their annual meeting in August 2017, these ministers agreed on 15 recommendations for implementation. A number of other recommendations were referred for further review, consultation or policy work. The measures in this bill have been agreed upon by state and territory consumer affairs ministers, and have been consulted on extensively, both through the Australian Consumer Law Review process and in an exposure draft, but the measures don't fully implement all provisions agreed by the government with the states.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 15 agreed measures, 10½ are in this bill, one was legislated in a previous bill and two are expected to be enacted through regulation. The 10½ measures, in the order in which they appear in the bill, are based on the following recommendations from the ACL Review:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This relates to the consumer protection laws around the sale or grant of land and will make terminology more consistent through the ASIC Act. And finally, the bill addresses recommendation 16:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three other proposals agreed by the federal, state and territory consumer affairs ministers which have been, or are expected to be, implemented through other legislative vehicles. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACLR proposal clarifies the mandatory text requirements for warranties against defects by developing specific services and services bundled with goods. This was included in the exposure draft of regulations that accompanied consultation on the bill. However, I note that the government is yet to indicate when they're likely to implement those regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Proposal 18 increases the maximum financial penalties available under the ACL. Of course, Labor took this policy with a tenfold increase in maximum penalties for anti-consumer conduct to the last election. We've been calling on the Turnbull government to implement it as a matter of urgency. We were pleased when the government announced that it would adopt Labor's policy in the 2017 budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislation to implement the increased penalties was introduced into the House on 15 February this year, and ACLR technical amendment C amended section 76 of the ACL, or the regulations, to clarify that disclosure requirements for unsolicited conduct arrangements don't apply in certain exempt agreements. This corrects a drafting error that obliges gas and electricity suppliers to disclose information about cooling-off rights or unsolicited consumer agreement even in circumstances where those rights don't apply. This was included in the exposure draft of the regulations that accompanied consultation to the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here, again, the government have not given an indication of when they intend to implement those regulations, and we would be keen to hear from the assistant minister as to the intentions in relation to enacting that recommendation. This brings us to one-and-a-half agreed proposals that are outstanding. The second half of one proposal relating to unsolicited selling is simply nowhere to be seen. We don't know what the government are doing with that proposal. Another recommendation to strengthen product safety recalls was featured in the exposure draft but removed from the bill for unknown reasons. Only the assistant minister knows why this was removed and won't explain it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACLR proposal 7 clarifies and strengthens voluntary recall requirements by introducing a statutory definition of voluntary recall and increasing penalties for failure or refusal to notify a voluntary recall in line with other ACL penalties. These provisions were included in the exposure draft bill but have been excluded from the bill as presented to the parliament. Again, the assistant minister hasn't explained why this has happened. It's another no-show from the assistant minister on this issue. We don't know if the government has abandoned this change contrary to the agreement it struck with states and territories last year, or is it, like so many other consumer reforms that the government has put, on the backburner while Australian consumers pay more?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that the assistant minister and the government in general have what we could say are complicated feelings when it comes to product recalls. The Turnbull government failed to explain why it took six months for a compulsory recall of the deadly Takata airbags. They were asleep at the proverbial wheel when it came to this issue. The potentially lethal Takata airbags have been found to have misfiring inflators capable of firing shrapnel through the vehicle's cabin. This means drivers and passengers were risking life and limb whenever they got into certain vehicles. The airbags can turn a minor incident into a fatal crash. Misfiring Takata airbags are believed to have killed over 20 people worldwide, including at least one Australian. The alpha airbags have been identified as particularly dangerous with a failure rate of one in two compared to a failure rate of one in 400 for other Takata airbag models.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was in August last year that the ACCC told the House Standing Committee on Economics that the deadly risk associated with the Takata alpha airbags meant they needed to be replaced immediately. That was the evidence that was given by the representatives of the ACCC at that hearing. The chairman, Rod Sims, also revealed that, as the Takata recall was voluntary at the time, there was little enforcement action that could be taken to ensure that everything possible was being done to replace the airbags. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The following day Labor called on the minister responsible for product safety, the current Deputy Prime Minister, to use his emergency powers under section 132J of the Competition and Consumer Act. We called for an immediate issuing of a compulsory recall of Takata airbags, amid growing concerns about the inadequacy of the voluntary recall process and renewed urgency around the alpha type of airbags. The result: nothing. The government did nothing. It took another six months, until February 2018, for a compulsory recall to be issued. They were asleep at the wheel whilst Australians were unknowingly risking their lives. Every time a person got behind the wheel or was a passenger, they were in danger. One Australian had already died, and it took six months for the government to take any action. What was Minister McCormack waiting for?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I want to speak about proposal 12, which clarifies that the 'unsolicited selling' provisions capture suppliers in their negotiations with consumers where suppliers obtain from a third party—sometimes referred to as a lead generator—a consumer's contact details or permission to be contacted. This wasn't even included in the exposure draft of the bill, and again we await an explanation as to why. It's yet another sign, as if we needed more, of the government's half-hearted approach to ensuring Australian consumer protections. Perhaps even saying 'half-hearted' may be generous. While the government make the right noises about reforms that were already in train or reviews that Labor started, in the end they always fall short. We've seen the government drag their feet on payday-lending reforms, we've seen them try to confuse consumers around measurement labelling, and we've heard nothing but talk in relation to improving consumer protections for retirement home residents. But Labor has been working to improve outcomes for Australian consumers—with or without the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There would be few better examples of the government's reluctance to improve protections for vulnerable consumers than their approach to payday lending and rent-to-buy schemes. We've seen these changes flicked back and forth between ministers and the assistant minister since the small-amount credit contract review reported in early 2016. Under amendments made by Labor in 2012 to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, the government commissioned a review of small-amount credit contracts in 2015, which reported to the government in March 2016. The government's response was released in November 2016. Minister O'Dwyer indicated in February 2017 that drafting was underway, and we were told that the drafters were putting pen to paper to implement the SACC review's recommendations. But the following day, under questioning from Senator Katy Gallagher, Treasury revealed in estimates that the minister was incorrect and that drafting actually had not commenced. In the 2017 budget estimates, in May, Treasury again confirmed that drafting had not commenced around this particular reform. The former member for Perth, Tim Hammond, led a private member's motion debate about the SACC reforms in the Federation Chamber on 4 September last year. Then by late 2017, after responsibility for the reforms had been delegated to the Minister for Small Business—now the Deputy Prime Minister—the government released an exposure draft of the legislation. It meant to enact the recommendations of the SACC review and promised that the bill would enter the parliament by the end of that year. To date no legislation has been introduced and, following the December 2017 reshuffle, responsibility for these reforms has been brushed off to the member for Deakin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on very low incomes have little or no capacity to absorb financial shocks. With little disposable cash after bills are paid and with little savings put away for a rainy day, one of the obvious options is a payday loan. We've all seen the TV ads. There's a profligacy of these payday lenders now springing up and using advertising—cash while you wait, and loans via apps. They're springing up everywhere.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also rent-to-buy schemes for consumer leases, under which a consumer will enter into an arrangement by which they rent a consumer good—a vacuum cleaner, a fridge or a dishwasher—from a company for a period, and at the end of the period they get to keep the good. This is becoming increasingly common with mobile phones. Labor recognises that these types of unconventional small-finance arrangements play a legitimate role in smoothing out the swings and roundabouts of modern life for low-income families. However, we do remain opposed to credit contracts that see some of the lowest income citizens being trapped in cycles of debt in which, if they don't meet the initial repayment obligations, they are forced to pay interest rates that often are in the hundreds of per cent when they come to paying back the debt. Cash loans are being described as leases to avoid caps on costs under national credit laws, and leases and loans have been given to people who already had financially crippling debt repayments for existing loans. Rent-to-buy contracts have ended up costing consumers over 800 per cent of the retail price of the good. Payday lenders are using loopholes to avoid having to follow the rules of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, and some providers have incorrectly used rent alone to calculate an applicant's expenses without taking into consideration grocery costs, bills and other cost-of-living items.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the positive side, some small-amount credit contract providers have waived fees and created special payment plans for people in extreme circumstances. There are other options for those who need small loans. For example, the No Interest Loan Scheme makes loans of up to $1,000 available for low-income consumers. They are available via community organisations. NILS is operated by Good Shepherd Microfinance and is supported by the Australian government and the National Australia Bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But low-income consumers on fringe finance should not have to rely on credit companies' charity and goodwill. They need robust consumer protections. That's why in February Labor introduced the government's consultation draft of its payday lending reform bills as a private member's bill. The government was dragging its heels, and Labor came to the party and actually introduced the legislation—the exact same legislation—on behalf of the government. It shouldn't come to that. If the minister responsible was doing their job they wouldn't drag their heels. They would get this legislation into the parliament. Labor's payday lending private member's bill implements the government's own policy in relation to the reforms as expressed in its response to the SACC review over a year ago. As such, the bill must be supported by government members. It isn't just a stunt to get the government's failure to implement anything that looks remotely like an agenda; it's about having a heart and implementing the recommendations that have been agreed to by the council of ministers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, Labor supports the passage of this bill. We can't let it pass without noting that the government is failing in its responsibility to protect consumers and implement the recommendations of the reviews that have been undertaken and the agreements that have been made by the ministerial council through a COAG process. As is the case with payday lending reforms, we can only assume that the government is hoping that it can quietly sweep these policies—policies that the Deputy Prime Minister has already agreed to—under the carpet. Labor won't allow that. That's why we've introduced the private member's bill. That's why the government should bring that on for debate and finally allow and agree to these reforms going through the parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will start with comments by Professor Judith Sloan written in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> about AGL, one of Australia's largest providers of electricity. Professor Sloan wrote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… AGL is the biggest provider of coal-fired electricity in the country and more than 90 per cent of its (rising) profits is sourced from fossil fuels.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">But we are still told to believe that the company is changing by moving into that rent-seeking space: renewables. But if you look at AGL’s profile of production, renewables are small beer and will remain so for a considerable period of time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now some might think hypocrisy by having to put up with the company’s marketing messages, egged on by a bunch of staffers some of whom have been trained by none other than Mr Inconvenient Truth himself, Al Gore.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">But where you think hypocrisy, I think misleading and deceptive. I can’t believe that the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission hasn’t launched a case against AGL for using false information to attract customers. Surely a company that derives over 90 per cent of its profits from coal and gas can’t portray itself as green as grass.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Its recent behaviour, its stated intentions to close Liddell (all 2000 megawatts) and comments from the Yank have all belled the cat for the public by exposing the distorted Australian electricity market as an expensive and unreliable racket. It is now clear that the government must act and this does not involve doling out even more favours to the unreliable renewables sector.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is Professor Judith Sloan. In another article she also talks about AGL's plan to close down the Liddell coal-fired power station. Professor Sloan writes:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">…when a company is planning to short the market and drive up prices, why would it accept a bid from a competitor to keep the Liddell plant in operation?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's simply following the money trail, even if there are profoundly anti-competitive aspects to the way the company operates – its ownership of a dominant retail operation, for instance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Something doesn't ring true here. Liddell is so valuable that Alinta's bid of $250m is too low but it's too expensive to keep going. Politicians and consumers should smell a rat.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As events panned out, the ACCC was completely on the money and AGL is simply exercising its full market power to take low-cost coal electricity out of the market and partially replace it with unreliable renewable energy and a small amount of very expensive gas.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to a case a decade ago about how competition law can deal with such anticompetitive conduct. This was in Germany back in 2008. I'm reading from the European Commission's <span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ompetition policy newsletter</span> about how German authorities acted with a large electricity generator that had shorted the market:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">E.ON is the large electricity generator in Germany, with very equivalent circumstances to AGL's market, market share and control here. It goes on:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time in the Commission's decision-making practice, the decision requires the company concerned to dispose of very significant assets: E.ON will have to divest 5,000 MW of generation capacity</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first case relates to the German electricity wholesale market and the concern that E.ON may have carried out a strategy of short-term capacity withdrawal and deterrence of investments in electricity generation by third parties.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, under European competition law, it is illegal, it is prohibited, for a company with a dominant position to limit production to the prejudice of consumers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen from the comments of Professor Sloan that closing the Liddell Power Station will limit production to the prejudice of consumers. How will this work under Australian Competition Law? Previously, our competition law provided that a company with a substantial degree of market power could not take advantage of that power to eliminate or substantially damage a competitor, to prevent the entry of a person into that market, or to deter or prevent a person from engaging in competitive behaviour in that market or another market. Perhaps, under those terms, there could be a case made out that a company with a substantial degree of market power cannot limit production to the prejudice of consumers. However, we actually changed that law and now it provides:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market must not engage in conduct that has the purpose, or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the test in Australia is: does the conduct that we're looking at result in a substantial lessening of competition? Under European competition law, the test is limiting production to the prejudice of consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had extensive discussions with the ACCC. They do not believe that they can prove the case that AGL closing Liddell, not selling it to a competitor and withdrawing that production capacity from the market would be a substantial lessening of competition. But if we had the provision in our competition law that the Europeans have, which says that, if you have a dominant position in the market, you cannot limit production to the prejudice of consumers, we would have a clear-cut case against AGL's conduct with Liddell. Make no mistake: what they are preparing to do will short the market. Yesterday they put out a replacement plan. But how can you equate the extra capacity they are putting into the market to the closing of Liddell and not the closing of the Northern Power Station or the closing of the Hazelwood Power Station? They've already exited from the market. How they can equate that to Liddell specifically is quite beyond me. If we look at the details of their replacement plan, yes, there may be an argument that they are replacing the same dispatchable capacity. But when you look at what they are planning to replace in dispatchable megawatt hours to the grid, their replacement plan will limit production by about 50 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not saying that AGL as a company should be forced to keep that plant open against their wishes, but if they have competitors in the market that are willing, able and prepared to buy that plant from them, I say they are actually engaging in conduct that will limit production, and it will be to the prejudice of consumers. If our existing competition laws are not strong enough to find that conduct anticompetitive, we need to have a close look at our competition laws and make a laser-like amendment to those laws, especially in the area of essential services. We cannot have companies that supply essential services—electricity is one of those—limiting production. We cannot run our factories, we cannot heat our homes, we cannot have the lights on, we cannot have our trains and our communications systems all running and we cannot have our hospitals running without reliable electricity being delivered to the grid. There is no other market where we have a provision in our competition law that provides that a company that is in a dominant position, or has a substantial degree of market power, can limit production to the prejudice of consumers. That is the plan that AGL have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to this parliament that we have an obligation to Australian consumers. We have an obligation to Australian industry to make sure they remain internationally competitive. If AGL are continuing down this track, we should adopt those principles of European competition law. We can apply them specifically to essential services. We can give them a very clear message that this parliament and this country will not accept the anticompetitive conduct that they are engaged in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes 11 amendments to our competition laws. I could go through them all, but for brevity I commend them and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Australian Consumer Law Review) Bill 2018. But I do so while simultaneously raising concerns that I have with respect to consumer laws in this country. It is true that we have done much over the years to protect consumers, as a result of consumer law legislation at both federal and state level. But there are still too many gaps within our laws, which allow unethical operators—some of whom are very well-known brands—to exploit consumers. It is little wonder that, today, consumer confidence in all sectors of society is diminishing. We've heard other speakers talk about some of the areas that are still not adequately covered by consumer law protection. I will list a handful of them before I get to some specific comments I wish to make in respect of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard about payday lenders: like in every industry sector, there are good and bad operators. But the bad operators are clearly taking advantage of some of Australia's most vulnerable people. When they're in the greatest need and have to go and cash in products that they own, they then get taken advantage of. I have heard of people paying, sometimes, amounts of maybe 10 times what the value of the product would have been, had they had the money to have bought the product up front.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard about car manufacturers—again, I heard only in recent days about the CEO of one global car company who may be jailed as a result of the performance indicators being fabricated with respect to the brand of that vehicle. We have airlines and insurance companies using fine-print contracts to avoid meeting their obligations or to add extra charges for consumers. Telcos are doing the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the private health insurance industry—only today there was information that private health insurance complaints rose by 30 per cent in the last year alone. We have exclusions between one company and another with respect to the policies or excess co-payments being charged. These exclusions make it almost impossible for consumers to try and compare the policies of the various companies, if they decide that they want to take up private health insurance. Not surprisingly, with all of the confusion, the number of people that are now covered by private health insurance is diminishing and people are dropping out—because of the confusion and because they find that the companies are taking advantage of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the question of the energy and other utility service providers, which the previous speaker also referred to in his remarks. It has become almost a daily practice that, in my office and throughout the community, I hear complaints, or complaints are brought to me, about the activities of the energy providers in particular. Whilst there are several of them out there now, certainly, in my home state of South Australia, trying to choose which provider a consumer will go to is becoming increasingly difficult because it's becoming almost impossible to make fair comparisons between what each of them have to offer. And it was only a day or so ago that there was an article released by Bruce Mountain, Director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre from the Victoria University, which stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A recent survey found that Australia’s power companies are less trusted than media companies, banks and telcos. … One feature that deserves close scrutiny is the all-pervasive discount. In electricity retailing, all but 3 of the 28 active retailers use discounts in their retail offers. … discounts give customers the impression that they are making a smart buy. This is often true, particularly in cases where it is easy to see and compare the discounted prices. But if it’s not easy to compare, customers may not realise if they’ve been duped.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to discounts, Mr Mountain goes on to list the ways—and I won't read the whole list—that, quite often, the customers are duped, to use his language:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">some discounts are worked out as a percentage of usage charges while others are on the total bill</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those examples highlight why consumers are finding it so difficult to make choices and, in fact, how consumers are being taken advantage of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn to a matter that is current right now. I refer to the case of Toys "R" Us, who went into, I think, receivership on about 21 May. I understand that all operations of Toys "R" Us will close in Australia by 5 July. The administrators are McGrathNicol. On about 21 May, the administrators issued a statement in respect of the company. For the benefit of anyone listening, I will say that the company has about 700 permanent and casual staff here in Australia. It's got 44 stores in the country, three of which are in South Australia with two of those being in my own electorate. In South Australia, there are about 70 employees, and the two stores in my electorate would cover about 40 of those employees. Firstly, I hope those employees are properly covered with respect to their worker entitlements and the pay that they are entitled to receive. The other issue that concerns me with respect to the administrators of Toys "R" Us is that they made a decision that anyone who holds a gift voucher cannot use it unless they expend an equivalent amount of additional funds on the day they go to collect their gift voucher value. I will read directly from the frequently asked questions sheet put out by McGrathNicol:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Gift cards, coupons and store credits</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The terms of redemption depend on the nature of the card, coupon or store credit. Ordinarily, gift cards and store credits represent an unsecured claim against TRU Australia and would not be able to be redeemed. Until 5 July 2018, the Administrators have agreed to honour gift cards, coupons and store credits in store only, on the basis that the total transaction is at least double the value of the gift cards, coupon or store credit amount utilised in that transaction (i.e. to utilise a $100 gift card, the value of the transaction must be at least $200.) </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If customers do not utilise or are unable to utilise their gift cards or store credit in accordance with these conditions, they can complete a Proof of Debt for the balance they are owed. … Westfield gift cards may be used with restriction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, immediately, there is a differentiation between one type of gift card and another. That, in itself, is wrong. But what is even more wrong is that the decision to have holders of gift cards required to spend an additional amount was never part of the understanding when that gift card was purchased. Therefore, whilst the administrator may well be within their rights to impose that condition, it is totally unethical and immoral to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know whether it is within the rights of the administrator. I would have thought that, whilst the company or the shops are trading—and they will be trading to 5 July—the holders of those gift cards should be allowed to go to the store and cash them in for the products that they want at the value of the gift card, without any additional conditions. If there are conditions, I suspect that the purchasers of those gift cards were never told about them, or that they are subject to change and that new conditions might be applied to them in the future. That is a matter of serious concern, because, I suspect, it will affect hundreds and possibly thousands of consumers around Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an issue which also arose back in early 2016 when the Dick Smith stores around Australia also closed. The same thing happened there—in terms of the cards not being honoured because they were considered to be unsecured creditors. I don't believe that, at that time, there was an expectation that holders of the cards had to spend an equivalent value to the gift card value; they were simply not honoured. Again, I find that that is totally unfair on the purchasers and holders of those gift cards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know how we close those kinds of loopholes, but these are matters that affect thousands of people in the community and there should be ways of closing them. One of the suggestions that I would make is that, perhaps, when a gift card is purchased the money should go into a trust account of some kind where it cannot be used for normal business purposes by the owner of that business, so at least it will be there should the business go bankrupt or become unable to continue trading. That would not only secure the money for the holders of the cards but also guarantee the business some future purchase, which would enable the business to know that its sales would be there in the months ahead as people cashed those cards in. But there may be better ways of doing it. I raise this matter because I know that it is affecting people right now. Indeed, given that the operators of Toys "R" Us are still trading to 5 July, I hope that they might reconsider. Having said that, I'm not holding my breath that they will. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As other speakers have pointed out, this legislation does make improvements. I accept that and I support the improvements being made. I am, however, conscious that consumers continue to be exploited by unethical operators. In my office it's perhaps one of the most common matters that we have to deal with: we step in to try to assist residents in my electorate who have been in some way or another treated unfairly by operators. Sometimes we have success, but not always. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  One of the most common comments I get as a federal member of parliament is: 'Why can't you people just agree on something? Anything!' If anybody were to watch question time they would think both the government and the opposition are constantly at loggerheads on every single point, and that every single point is taken. So it's refreshing to see matters such as this where both the coalition government and the Labor Party can come together and agree on some very sensible measures. And these are sensible measures. They are sensible measures that have come about as a result of the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations. They're not hugely groundbreaking, but they are progressive and they do certainly improve the act as it stands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a past life when I was a barrister, from time to time I acted on behalf of clients who relied on the Competition and Consumer Act 2010; its previous iteration, the Trade Practices Act 1974; or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. I want to rise today to express to the House the importance of this bill for so many of our constituents. Around budget time, debates in this place often revolve around unimaginable sums of money—macroeconomics, huge spending programs, figures with some so many zeros they're almost incomprehensible to the average person. The Turnbull government has made those big economic decisions in my own community, with billions of dollars for the road and rail infrastructure that we need on the Sunshine Coast and, quite frankly, that's in no small part thanks to the minister sitting at the dispatch box tonight. I want to thank him for his terrific work when he was the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. He truly did an absolutely sensational job, and I have no doubt that he will do a similar job in his role as Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to our constituents' daily lives, often it's not the big spending programs and government grants that have the biggest impact. We often talk about some of these programs—for instance, the $3.2 billion that's being spent on infrastructure on the Sunshine Coast. Sometimes the biggest impacts are small community grants, sometimes only worth a few thousand dollars. To the average community group or the average person, that's a lot more tangible than $3.2 billion. I mean, what is $3.2 billion? What does it look like? I don't know. I've never seen it. I've never experienced that sort of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But one of our duties and our privileges in this place is to pass laws which protect ordinary Australians from the harm caused by the misbehaviour among those who have power over them. Alongside record spending on health and education, unprecedented income tax reform that we just announced last week and $75 billion in infrastructure investment, the Turnbull government has been very active in protecting everyday Australians from corruption, from exploitation and from fraud. We introduced the Australian Building and Construction Commission to protect workers and employers in the construction industry from the threats, intimidation and violence of the union movement and its most lawless representative, the CFMMEU. We passed the Fair Work Amendment (Corrupting Benefits) Act 2017 to protect working Australians from having their pay and conditions traded away in return for secret backhanders. We passed the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Act 2017 to stamp out the exploitation of low-paid workers, first identified in the franchising sector. As I speak, we have bills before the House and in the other place to protect superannuation savers from the improper management of their retirement savings. These and many other pieces of legislation brought forward by the Turnbull government demonstrate our commitment to protecting ordinary Australians from corruption and exploitation. There is only one side of politics that is standing up. This side of politics, the Turnbull government, is standing up for vulnerable Australians, and that is a very noble thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I saw so often during my time as a barrister, ordinary consumers can face exploitation and misbehaviour from unscrupulous traders. It has to be said that most businesses operate with great integrity and with a focus on consumer satisfaction; it's at the forefront of their minds. However, there will be those who make mistakes, some intentionally. Some of them go out of their way, unfortunately, to make a quick buck by exploiting vulnerable people. The Turnbull government recognises that this is an unfortunate reality. Importantly, we also recognise that, as the world is changing, these threats change, and so the legislation that we have to address those threats must keep pace. We recognise that, in an increasingly competitive environment for products like insurance, entertainment, telecommunications and financial services, there's been a resurgence in aggressive sales techniques in public places like shopping centres and CBD streets and often in people's own homes when they get doorknocked and phone-called. Consumers can be just as vulnerable to high pressure sales and exploitation in those locations as they can in the traditional door-to-door setting. The existing law was not clear enough that these situations were covered by the proper consumer protections, so schedule 4 of this bill makes that explicit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises that, in an era of new technology start-ups, alternative business-funding models and more flexible approaches to growth, public listing is no longer the preserve only of very large and well established businesses. That's why schedule 2 of this bill removes the carve-out which excludes publicly listed companies from protection against unconscionable conduct. We recognise that, among other things, the significant focus on speed and convenience in online sales has increased the prevalence of so-called preselected options. Too often these added-cost preselected options are not reflected in the headline price and can easily be confusing to consumers. Schedule 6 therefore ensures that in the future they will have to be made clear throughout.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Online sales in recent years have also dramatically increased the weight of goods being shipped or otherwise transported rather than purchased in person. Schedule 9 of this bill extends consumer guarantees to better cover the transport of these goods as well as providing consumers with more power to deploy those rights for themselves. We recognise that the increasing complexity of many services, especially services delivered online or using digital technology, has led to more opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and businesses to demand payment for services which were not only never requested but never in fact supplied. This includes, perhaps most notably, unsolicited demands for payment for the spurious renewal of online domain names. Schedule 3 clarifies that this behaviour is prohibited under the Consumer Law's false-billing provisions. Mr Deputy Speaker, I don't know about you, but nothing riles me more, apart from the Labor Party and the CFMEU, than receiving a letter in the mail saying that I have to pay a particular account for something that I did not ask for and that I did not purchase.</span>

                    </a>  We don't talk about that. The government has also listened to my colleagues in the legal profession, and this bill contains further practical measures to improve access to justice for consumers. Schedule 1 of the bill extends the follow-on provisions of the Australian Consumer Law to more closely match those which apply to competition law and to allow private litigants to rely on admissions of fact made by the respondent in earlier proceedings as prima facie evidence in their own case. Schedule 6 extends the minister's or delegate's power to issue disclosure notices to obtain information about the safety of goods or services to third parties like other traders, test laboratories, safety consultants or consumers. Schedule 7 further removes impediments to robust investigation of wrongdoing by extending the power of the ACCC and ASIC to use their statutory powers to determine whether a contract may be unfair. Finally, schedule 8 clarifies the remedies which are available to the court to ensure that community orders can be used sensibly to get injured parties the services they need, whatever the specific qualifications of the person in breach.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whenever I hold a seniors forum or whenever I talk to consumer groups, I, as a barrister—although I'll tell them this isn't legal advice—will try to give them some instruction. I tell them this very simple principle—and I'll use this opportunity, this megaphone of the House of Representatives, to tell all the millions of people who will be listening right now—if someone rings you and tries to sell you something or if someone knocks on your door and tries to sell you something, whatever it is they are selling, you shouldn't be buying. Not everybody's a rip-off merchant, but I always err on the side of caution. If I want to buy something, I'll go out, I'll do my research and I will look to see who the most appropriate company is to deal with. If someone knocks on your door or rings your phone and they want to sell you something, hang up; close the door.</span>

Protect what is yours—protect your hard-earned money. As a barrister, I saw the impact that breaches of these and many other consumer law provisions can have on everyday consumers. I saw how much more serious these impacts can be on vulnerable Australians, particularly our older Australians.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that happens, unfortunately, very much in the online space. I hope my dad doesn't mind me saying this, but someone recently tried to rip him off as he tried to buy a car. The banks cop an absolute shellacking here, there and everywhere, but he literally got as far as the bank teller to get a bank cheque drawn, and the bank teller said: 'Mr Wallace, there's something about this transaction that doesn't sound right to me. Do you mind if I make some inquiries?' She went out the back and made some inquiries. My dad is 84. The teller came back out the front and said: 'Mr Wallace, I think you've been scammed. I can write this bank cheque for you if you like, but I really suggest that you don't do it.' Sure enough, Dad came to within an inch of being scammed for $10,000-odd. So, whatever you do, be very careful online. These are important reforms and I commend them to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to contribute to the Airports Amendment Bill 2016. In 1914, Claude Grahame-White, the English aviator and first pilot to ever make a night flight, had this to say about aviation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First Europe, and then the globe, will be linked by flight, and nations so knit together that they will grow to be next-door neighbors… What railways have done for nations, airways will do for the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And how correct he was. Aviation has transformed our world, shrinking the way we perceive distance while growing the global economy. Today it supports almost 63 million jobs and generates some $2.7 trillion in global GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is benefiting from the growth in this sector, which contributes in excess of $30 billion every year to the Australian economy and supports more than half a million jobs. Tourism has driven a significant proportion of this growth. Over the last 20 years, international passenger movements have grown at an annual average rate of some 4.5 per cent, while domestic passenger movements have increased by 2.5 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But aviation is also pushing boundaries and unlocking new opportunities in other ways through advancements in technology. On 24 March this year, QF9 departed Perth for London, the first ever direct flight connecting Australia to Europe. This is a game changer for WA and a glimpse of things to come for Australia. Consequently, it is in this context that we must consider the Airports Amendment Bill 2016, which seeks to amend the Airports Act 1996 to streamline processes for development at and around federally leased airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that our airports are critical pieces of national economic infrastructure. They connect towns and cities across the nation to each other and are our gateway to the rest of the world. But their operations can impact significantly on the social amenity of the communities of which they are a part, which is why developments at our airports must be well planned and communities properly consulted. Already there is much development occurring around the nation's major airports, including the new greenfields airport underway in Western Sydney. In addition, major developments are at different stages of progress in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, which are all getting new runways. While we need to ensure that the aviation sector continues to grow, we must also see to it that communities which live in proximity to airports aren't disproportionately affected by this growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor strongly supports this investment in aviation infrastructure. However, this investment must be underpinned by a social compact between airports and the communities that live around them. Consequently, Labor is proposing two amendments to the Airports Amendment Bill 2016 to ensure that this occurs: firstly, that the monetary trigger threshold for major development plans be reduced to $25 million and, secondly, that the automatic approval of requests for shorter public consultation periods in relation to major development plans be removed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned, this bill will streamline processes for development at and around federally leased airports, which Labor largely welcomes. Unlike most other infrastructure, the federal government is the consent authority for major airport development, with states and territories playing a secondary role. This has a number of implications. Firstly, under existing federal legislation, 19 of the 21 federally leased airports are required to prepare a master plan every five years, which is then subject to approval by the federal minister. What that means, literally, is that every five years you have a process whereby development not just over those five years but with a 20-year forward horizon has to be approved by the minister. It means that we have strategic direction for development around airports. It means that communities can have ongoing input into the operation of airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a critical change, and it arose from the 2009 aviation white paper, undertaken under the former Labor government. This was the first time ever that we had had a strategic plan for aviation with a green-paper and white-paper process in this country. One of the important processes of reforms that came up through that white-paper process is the legislation that we are dealing with here today in terms of moving further amendments. Importantly, the master plan update process does require that community consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, major developments at airports, including certain projects that currently cost more than $20 million in construction, require federal approval of a major development plan. The 21 airports subject to this legislation are Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Darwin, Bankstown, Gold Coast, Alice Springs, Camden, Townsville, Tennant Creek, Archerfield, Mount Isa, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide, Perth, Essendon, Launceston, Parafield, Jandakot and Moorabbin. Western Sydney Airport is also included. The Airports Amendment Bill 2016 will make a number of changes to the existing approvals process. These include moving eligible airports from a five-year master plan to an eight-year cycle. However, the main gateway airports of Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth will remain on a five-year cycle, as will Western Sydney after representations from Labor, because with the new airport you will need to ensure that there is closer monitoring over its initial years of operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additional changes include that an updated Australian Noise Exposure Forecast will be required in each master plan—that is, you will have out there, in a transparent way in each master plan, a clear update of what the noise impact will be for each of these airports around Australia. All 21 airports will enable that process, which will, of course, need to include the community consultation as well. The legislation proposes to lift the monetary trigger for the requirement for a separate major development plan for certain major projects from $20 million to $35 million. Our amendment that we will move in consideration in detail to reduce that back down to $25 million will receive the support of the government as well. I thank the incoming minister, Minister McCormack, who is certainly more consultative than some of his predecessors. That is a constructive dialogue that has occurred with the new minister. This is essentially a CPI increase from the previous figure of $20 million to $25 million. That is a reasonable change, but I think people want to ensure that that scrutiny isn't reduced. Hence, the figure of $25 million is a sensible resolution, and I think it's a good sign that the minister has been prepared to accept Labor's proposition on that. It will also introduce three-yearly cost indexation thereafter, so that will get around the issue of what the figure should be in the future. The automatic indexation removes the need to come back into the parliament and make amendments to the act. This will, of course, also allow for better definition of cost elements of the trigger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The monetary trigger, however, already sits alongside subjective alternative triggers for requiring MDPs as well, based on significant environmental or other impacts. If anything of significance is occurring and, regardless of the value, it is going to have a significant environmental impact, the major development plan is automatically triggered regardless of the value of that upgrade of the airport by any particular project which may be under the monetary threshold. This is a sensible reform as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes will include establishing a decision time frame of 15 days for the minister to consider reduced consultation periods for major development plans. What is in the proposal originally was that a plan would be deemed to be approved if the time frame were not met. This aligns with existing provisions in the act relating to deemed master plan approval after a 50-day period. What we will be proposing in our amendment that we will move in consideration in detail is a process so that the request, rather than being assumed to have been approved, will be assumed to have been refused. What that ensures is that something can't be approved due to omission, or due to a failure to take action, and will ensure the conscious involvement of the minister but also that those processes around the approval of the MDP are kept in place. It will enable the minister to extend, by more than once, the period during which major developments are required to be substantially completed. Failure to comply can lead to civil penalties under existing legislation. For example, when I was the minister there were occurrences whereby a project simply hadn't been completed. What this will do is allow for that period of examination to be extended. Again, a common sense resolution that is about making a practical change to the operation of the act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will also allow airport operators to notify the minister if exceptional circumstances mean that a major development cannot proceed. At the moment, if an approval is given for a particular project and it can't proceed, because of circumstances of a failure to receive financing for a project or for another reason, the act provides for civil penalties to be imposed under the existing legislation. This is also a sensible change. According to the government, these changes will relieve inefficient outcomes for the industry while lifting unnecessary and onerous administrative burdens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has supported the broad consultative mechanisms involving local community engagement, proper assessment of community impacts and reasonable mitigation measures to address these impacts. Generally, the package reduces the burden on approval for development of the affected airports and creates more flexibility around legislative time frames whilst ensuring that the protections for consultation and other measures are not diluted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support the amendments. We've put forward the two amendments to the Airport Amendment Bill. We are pleased that the government has seen the virtue of our practical amendments and will be supporting them when they are moved. The first amendment is that a major development plan must be completed in a number of circumstances, including when a monetary trigger is reached. The current monetary trigger of $20 million was determined back in 2007, so a rough guestimate would indicate that increasing the threshold to $25 million is practical. The $25 million essentially reflects the changes in construction costs over that 10-year period. The opposition looked at the ABS construction CPI, which showed that costs have increased by 20 per cent since 2007. Hence, a consistent position of applying basically a 20 per cent increase to that threshold, so a practical figure of $25 million is reasonable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the second amendment, the simple fact is that communities do require proper consultation. Currently, the public consultation period associated with draft major development plans, as specified in subsection 92(2A), of the act is 60 business days. However, the minister can approve a shorter period of not less than 15 business days if asked in writing by the airport operator to do so, and as long as they are satisfied that the proposed development is consistent with the airport masterplan and does not raise any issues that have a significant impact on the local or regional community. The proposed amendment inserts a new subsection 92(2BA), which would provide that if the airport makes a request for a shorter consultation period, and the minister does not make a decision on the request within 15 business days, then the minister is deemed to have approved that shorter period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor couldn't support such an amendment, because it had the potential to undermine the rights of local communities to have their say. In the words of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> prepared by the Parliamentary Library:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment seems to raise the possibility that the Minister could simply not decide on the request, and then be deemed to have approved the short period, even if the development is inconsistent with the airport master plan, or raises issues that have a significant impact on the local or regional community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not for the first time, the people in the Parliamentary Library who do the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span> have got it right. We're very fortunate to be able to benefit as lawmakers from proper advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be well within a minister's capability to consider within 15 days a request for reduced consultation, and, where that doesn't occur, it certainly isn't appropriate that the request would be deemed approved anyway. I wouldn't suggest that some of the ministers under this government who've had control of infrastructure might have slept through 15 days, but, if you were cynical perhaps, you might come to that conclusion and be concerned that it would be deemed to be approved by not making a decision. That would not be appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure that the current minister—and it's been a revolving door; it's got to be said. There have been four of them in the last very short period of time. I've got on with all of them okay, it must be said, and have had reasonable working relations with them. Nonetheless, I do not want to see circumstances whereby decisions are deemed to have been made by not making a decision. That is not a sensible way to legislate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this Airports Amendment Bill—you will note, Mr Deputy Speaker—is the Airports Amendment Bill 2016. It's been around for a while. That would indicate perhaps that the people who've had responsibility for it aren't as dynamic as they could have been, given that it is now towards the middle of 2018, so that makes my point, I think. It's good that Minister McCormack has gotten on top of this issue so quickly, it having just sat on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of Labor's record when it comes to aviation. We have always sought to balance the needs of the sector with the rights of the community. Aviation is an important economic asset for the nation. In an island continent such as ours, we by definition rely in modern times, in this century, on aviation to connect ourselves with the world, whether that be by Australians travelling to and from the world—we're great travellers—or, importantly, by attracting tourists to come here as well and therefore creating jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aviation white paper had a range of reforms which this legislation reflects, prohibiting developments incompatible with aviation use on federal airport sites, for a start, unless exceptional circumstances exist. So the priority of airports is aviation. That sounds an obvious thing, but the fact is that, because it was federal land, a whole range of developments that were incompatible with aviation were considered to be supported in a range of airports, particularly the smaller airports, where general aviation is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we required federal airports to establish community aviation consultation groups. Before the aviation white paper and legislation, they didn't exist in most airports right around Australia. The interests both of the airports and of the communities around them are served by proper consultation. A range of airports do it better than others, but it is important that that be mandated so that for issues such as aircraft noise and the impact on communities there is an opportunity for communities to have that direct input.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We obligated federal airports to submit more detailed master plans, so no more could you have changes made which, essentially, hadn't been properly scrutinised. We introduced the new major development plan trigger, activated by any development with a significant community impact, regardless of size or cost. Before white paper, that was not a consideration. We established the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman. That was an important reform that has meant that communities have somewhere to go that is independent of the ownership of the airports and independent of the government. It's important that they could have confidence that there was an office that was dealing with aircraft noise, which can be an issue not just for major airports but for the many secondary airports, particularly around our capital cities. Of course, we also banned a range of older, noisier aircraft from operating at our airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by saying that Labor strongly supports investment in aviation. We understand the importance of the role that aviation plays in supporting jobs. We're committed to growing the sector. But the simple fact is that this investment must be underpinned by the social compact between airports and the communities that live around them. That's why we'll put forward those amendments to the Airports Amendment Bill 2016. That's why I am pleased that the government, and the minister, in particular, have indicated support for those amendments. I commend the bill to the House with the knowledge that the bill's flaws will be fixed by those amendments that we will move in the consideration in detail stage.</span>

I would like to congratulate him on his recent manifesto, where he said that it is not our job to sow discontent. That is so true. Class warfare, identity politics and sowing discontent in our nation are shameful practices which should be condemned and called out at every opportunity. I congratulate the member for Grayndler for that statement.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also congratulate him for his other statement—I hope I'm quoting correctly from his manifesto; he may like to interject in case I get it wrong—in which he said, 'we do have to engage constructively with business, large and small'. Absolutely; again, I agree with that 100 per cent. The idea that one side of this parliament wants to come and rip the tax cuts away and add an extra burden on small business is something that everyone in this parliament should stand up and condemn. I congratulate the member for Grayndler on that as he leaves the chamber.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back on 15 April 2014, the coalition government announced that the site of Sydney's new Western Sydney Airport would be at Badgerys Creek. I can remember being at Peakhurst High School in the 1970s, and our economics teacher, Mr Simpson, who was a fantastic economics teacher, said to the class—I can still recall today: 'There will never be another airport built in Sydney. In the lifetime of anyone in this classroom, there will never be another airport built in Sydney.' Well, it looks as though this is one of the rare occasions on which my high school economics teacher will be proven wrong, because the coalition is going ahead with the construction of this airport in Western Sydney.</span>

The member at the dispatch box should not make that inference about the member for Lindsay. I know she's trying her best, but you should not call her a rookie. I'm sure the member for Lindsay supports this airport, because she knows about the jobs that it will create in her local electorate and for her constituents. Construction of the airport will add a $3.6 billion infrastructure package and an estimated 8,000 new jobs. I see the two members sitting on the opposite side. A lot of those jobs will be for constituents in your electorates. I am very happy. They should be here supporting this bill 100 per cent, but instead we still hear this ranting and raving, this antibusiness rhetoric that we continually hear, this continual opposition for opposition's sake.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as we get on to the construction of a new airport in Western Sydney, there is one concern that I would like to raise. This goes to our commitment under the Paris climate control agreement. Under that, we have to reduce our carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 26 to 28 per cent off 2005 levels by the year 2030. One of the largest emissions sectors of our economy is transport. We know that by 2020 the transport sector will make up something like 18 per cent of our nation's CO2 or greenhouse gas emissions. Of that 18 per cent, according to a paper here on Australia's greenhouse emissions projections for 2017 by the Department of the Environment and Energy, Australia's domestic aviation emissions in 2020 will be nine million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, but by 2030 it will have increased to 12 million tonnes. So we're looking at a 30 per cent increase in the carbon emissions from our domestic aviation, yet under the Paris agreement that we have there has to be a 26 to 28 per cent reduction, not off 2020 levels but off 2005 levels. So, just on rough back-of-the-envelope calculations, if we are going to have every sector do its so-called share in that 26 to 28 per cent reduction, I see that from where we are today, rather than having an increase of a third in our domestic aviation emissions with more flights, more people travelling and more overseas tourists, we're going to have to have something like a 40 per cent decrease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where it gets interesting, because the policy of the mob on the other side, under the Paris agreement, is to have a 45 per cent reduction in emissions. So I put the challenge to those who sit on that side of the chamber: can you tell me what emissions reductions you want in our domestic aviation sector? What do you want?</span>

They want to prevent Australians from travelling, one of the greatest rights that we have. One of the greatest improvements that we've had is that Australians can travel and visit other areas of our nation, with all the tourism jobs that come with it. The opposition want a 45 per cent reduction. Not only would they be happy to close down our new airport in Western Sydney; but they would have to close down a lot of the internal flights around this nation to meet their absurd, economy-wrecking, job-destroying emissions reductions. It's very timely that the shadow assistant minister for climate change has come into the chamber, because he may be able to inform us what Labor's plan is to reduce emissions in the domestic aviation sector.</span>

                    </a>  I hear the interjection from the shadow assistant minister for climate change. Maybe he could inform the House sometime later tonight which nation per capita has a higher emissions reduction target than Australia. Is there any answer? Of course not. He knows it's correct: we have the highest emissions reduction target per capita in the world. The Labor Party say: 'That is not enough. We want to make it even higher. We want that 45 per cent emissions reduction target.' What would that do to domestic aviation? How many people do they want to deny the right to fly in Australia? How do they want to reduce it? This is the debate that we should be having. The Labor Party cannot hide behind these feel-good numbers without explaining what effect they will have on each sector of the economy. I would hope during this debate on aviation and the Western Sydney Airport that the Labor Party take the opportunity to tell the Australian citizens how many people they want to deny the right to fly. That is what their policy will result in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the issue of international air travel. We know that domestic air travel is a major part of our emissions profile. I've got some numbers here from 2016. We had 7. 1 million Australians fly domestically for leisure and travel. But 5.3 million Australians actually flew overseas for holidays. For business domestically, it was 2.1 million Australians. But 628,000 Australians flew overseas for business. If you look at the average flight internally in Australia—it might be from Sydney to Melbourne, from Melbourne to Brisbane or from Adelaide to Sydney—it probably averages around an hour and a half. But I would say those international flights would average eight to 12 hours. So our emissions from our international flights will be far, far greater than our emissions from our domestic flights. So, again, I ask members of the Labor Party: if they want to pursue their 45 per cent emissions reduction target—that economy-wrecking, job-destroying emissions reduction target—what is their policy on international aviation? How many Australians will they want to deny the right to fly overseas?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great privileges of being an Australian today is the opportunity that Australians have to travel overseas and see the world and to experience different cultures and different lands. Members of the Labor Party, with their emissions reduction target, want to take that opportunity away from Australians. They should explain their policy in full. How will you reduce your emissions? What are your plans? How many fewer Australians will have the right and the opportunity to travel overseas under your reckless, economy-destroying, 45 per cent emissions reduction target? I bet that we'll hear nothing from them, because if they explain their policies, if they let Australians know the harm that they are going to inflict on them, the rights that they are going to take away from them, the Labor Party will be consigned to electoral history. So they'll fudge it. They'll continue to talk about feel-good numbers and they'll continue to rant and rave, as we have seen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a fantastic opportunity. This bill gives every member of the Labor Party a chance to stand up, either at the dispatch box or at their seat in this House, and explain to the Australian public how many Australians they want to deny the right to fly, domestically and internationally. Because that is exactly what their policy is—</span>

                    </a>  Anyhow, talking of freedom of speech, I do reflect on the fact that the member has previously had very strong views about infrastructure developments, just as others are entitled to have the types of views about infrastructure developments that this bill is supposed to allow communities to have, to be able to have some impact on the way in which plans are made. While the member for Hughes during his contribution suggested that the Badgerys Creek airport would have massive job-creating impacts in Western Sydney, the reality is that in my part of Western Sydney it won't have anywhere near the impact. In fact, the coalition hung its hat on the claim that this airport would be needed in Western Sydney to create jobs. They said thousands of jobs would be created for Western Sydney. But it was interesting to note the sheepish admission from the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities a few months ago. We had been saying for ages, 'Put a figure on the number of jobs that will be created in Western Sydney by this.'—because the job figure bounces around like a ping-pong ball. On top of that, there is no firm commitment from them about whether or not the bulk of the jobs would be created. </span>

                    </a>  I take the interjection of the minister, who says, 'They're still jobs.' Yes, they are, but they're not jobs for the entire region; they are jobs that will be located largely in one part of Western Sydney. Western Sydney itself, growing at the pace that it is, is way bigger than many of those on the other side even understand or appreciate. I certainly wouldn't expect this minister to appreciate Western Sydney in any great detail whatsoever, other than it being a great talking point for a media release. The reality is this: instead of saying that the lion's share of jobs will be created in our area, all they can get is a 50 per cent target for job creation out of that airport. The bulk of the jobs won't even go to Western Sydney; 50 per cent of the jobs will be going to people outside the region. Can we land—pardon the unintended pun—on an actual jobs figure? The figure bounces around: is it 20,000 or 40,000? If it's 40,000 then 20,000 jobs will be created at this airport. That's it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is supposed to promote community dialogue and consultation, but this airport still hasn't released the actual flight paths. The minister might want to let us know when the flight paths for this airport are going to be released. This bill says they'll provide greater community consultation, and they can't tell you where the planes will fly. I've heard about a pub with no beer, but never an airport with no planes. They keep talking about all the jobs that this airport will create, but they can only do a 50 per cent job target, and they never tell you the actual flight paths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the big tip: I bet you any money we won't find the flight paths before an election, will we? No, not at all. They are ramping up the construction and making all the announcements, but they won't properly commit to the maximum number of jobs for Western Sydney and they don't have the guts to tell you where those planes will fly. This is scandalous: $10 billion of public funds are being spent on this airport—roughly $3½ billion on the road network around it then the $5 billion now being assumed by the Commonwealth for driving it—and they won't tell you the flight paths. They'll get so much of this thing built that, when the communities find out how they are affected, it'll be too late. It is the most cynical way to design, implement and manage a project of this size.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, by the way, was introduced in December 2016, and gets debated now, nearly two years later. We are told that the whole master plan concept will improve the way in which they'll consult with and bring people along with them on these developments, right? Rubbish! You can look at current experience: the community is not being treated with any respect on a major development right now. This is all about clamouring to an inner-city and Eastern Suburbs approach to what happens in Western Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Sydney is growing at such a pace. In my part of Western Sydney 150,000 people are moving in. The motorways and trains are crammed. The public hospital infrastructure doesn't keep pace with growth in our area. Hospital waiting lists for surgeries and emergency departments are crammed full. It's not keeping pace with development. The schools on the most backlogged maintenance lists in the state are located in Western Sydney, and we are not developing them. Funds are being cut from universities and from TAFEs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my part of Western Sydney 150,000 people are moving in, with another 300,000 moving into the south-west of Sydney, and the answer that is being advocated to fix clogged roads and rail, hospitals that are falling apart or not keeping pace with growth, and schools that don't get the proper funding is to put $10 billion into an airport. If I had ever said to a Western Sydney resident that the solution to all that is to spend $10 billion of public funds to build an airport, and to cynically do it in a way where the full impact of that development is not explained to the public, people would think you had rocks in your head. The reality is: that's exactly what is happening right now, where $10 billion is being put into one project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's before we even get to the expenditure on the North South Rail Line connecting the airport into Western Sydney or a western rail line from Penrith, where the member for Lindsay represents, through to the city. We're going to connect up all these people from that airport onto a congested Western Line. I would love for coalition ministers to go out to railway stations in Western Sydney and see rows five deep of people waiting to get on a train. Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, I'm sure you would see in Melbourne as well that people want to support public transport, and it is so patronised that trains are packed. I see it when I stand at the stations at Rooty Hill, Doonside and especially Mount Druitt. I think to myself, 'Those people are getting on trains where people from Penrith, Werrington, St Marys were then joined by people in Mount Druitt, Rooty Hill, Doonside before getting to the next major railway station of Blacktown.' They will stand the whole way—for over an hour, in the case of the member for Lindsay's constituents. Then, on top of that, we will connect patrons from the North South Rail Line without thinking if we've cleared the congestion on the Western Line, which the state government knows is a problem as well. None of that consultation takes place, but this bill that we're debating now should fix up a master plan just for an airport—one airport that's being put in there. It is wrong; people are right and they should be getting sick to their back teeth of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other big thing is the M7 motorway that's supposed to connect up. Mind you, no-one ever thought for a moment that, instead of building a North South Rail Line, they could use the easement on the M7, which is vacant right now. They could put in busways, a scalable response to meeting transport needs. They could convert those easements that are there—Transurban knows they are there; the government knows they are there—into bus lanes that would allow for buses to ferry people north-south. We're going to build a rail line, but we never thought of using an alternative. That will be wasted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The M7 is already getting congested. I commend the then Howard government on working with the state government to make that reality—it is a great roadway—but it is already starting to get congested because of growth in Western Sydney. We haven't even thought about the next big roadway, the M9, which has to run parallel to the M7. Where's the funding going to come from for that? When you put $10 billion into one federal project and then ask for more, it's very hard to do it because other states—and I notice the member for Holt is here and that the deputy speaker is from Melbourne—get a little bit itchy when you take $10 billion for one project and then want to ask for more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the dilemma that we have in Western Sydney. We know that all these other projects that need vital infrastructure support will now be competing not only against one big project but also against the other states and territories. We have 500,000-plus people moving into the region. The western part of Sydney will soon dwarf the eastern part in population numbers, but none of the decisions for Western Sydney actually get driven by Western Sydney people; it's all in the east. There are deals that could help parts of our area—these much-vaunted city deals that get announced—but the biggest council in Western Sydney does not have a city deal. Why? It is because it had the temerity to disagree with the federal government about the airport and so it has been blacklisted and not included as part of the city deal announcement. All these other councils get to go in, but the biggest council is left off it. Why? As I said, it is because it dared have an opposing view to this government. The biggest council with the largest population sector and the largest amount of development occurring is left off and not provided funding. It will get no federal funds to think in the long-term about how to do development in a way that will support growth in that part of Western Sydney. Again, eastern Sydney people—or people outside of Western Sydney—are calling the shots on what's happening. When we get this bill through, do you reckon I have any faith whatsoever that it'll actually deliver what it promises, which is supposedly better consultation? No, because I've seen what 'consultation' is; consultation is eastern and northern Sydney people calling the shots, as it has always been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I often say when it comes to Western Sydney, 'The things we need, we never get; the stuff we never ask for gets forced on us.' This bill is just a facade to support more of that behaviour, because, if Western Sydney started jacking up through the master plans and all the stuff that goes on that masks itself as consultation, we'd be ignored. No-one ever asked for this airport in our part of Western Sydney. They wanted serious jobs and serious infrastructure to deal with the things that we know are going to be long-term problems. But it will be too late. I'm happy to be proven wrong. If all my concerns about this airport turn out to be wrong, I'm happy to wear egg on my face. If I am right, I'll be interested to see if the people who argued for this airport will still be here. No, they will not, and we will have spent $10 billion on a facility and all the other infrastructure needs will have been neglected and people will have been left to suffer crowded roadways and crowded public transport, hospitals that don't meet their needs and schools that aren't being invested in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, good luck with this bill genuinely tapping into community sentiment. I very much doubt it will. Like much of the stuff this government does, it's all facade and no form.</span>

It's actually got a lot of importance when it comes to access to airports. We spend so much time thinking about flight routes and flight paths in our cities, but there's a reason aeroplanes have to fly over cities: they have to land at those airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of those airports play a very critical role for the people I represent when it comes to their health. Across the electorate of Mallee, the range of Air Ambulance helicopters is somewhat limited. That's just a physical limitation because of fuel. If you were flying from Essendon Airport you could get to Bendigo, but you certainly couldn't make it to Mildura without having to refuel and come back. So, because helicopter range is a limiting factor for health delivery in Victoria, we have to have fixed-wing aircraft that they need to land on an airstrip. Air Ambulance run a King Air B200. The Flying Doctor Service are running the Pilatus PC-12. Essentially, the King Airs are coming in and out of Essendon Airport, and I have been concerned that Essendon Airport, whilst it's a very strategic airport for us, has allowed more and more development. We need to be very careful that, when we think about the master plans for airports, we ensure they keep their primary focus—which is to ensure that they are available for aircraft to land in and land in safely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give an idea of the scale of the flights, we would have four aircraft a day coming out of Mildura, taking someone who might have a premature baby to a hospital in Melbourne, taking a victim of a car crash, taking a person who might have had a heart attack. That's four flights a day coming out of one town. Out of the township of Horsham we have three a day flying down to Melbourne, and out of the township of Swan Hill there are three a day on average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who don't know, I am a pilot myself. I own a good 177RG Cessna, one of the best light sport aircraft ever built—a nice Cessna with a Lycoming 200 horsepower fuel-injected engine, retractable gear and a constant-speed prop. It gets along at about 150 knots. When I am flying that plane, I am constantly coming across air ambulances flying across my electorate. So I see just how important this is. What we don't want is to get to a stage where we allow growth that doesn't match up with our national interests—growth that inhibits the opportunities to be landing at Essendon. In that case, air ambulances would have to go Moorabbin Airport, and I don't think that would be an acceptable outcome for the people of Victoria. The difference in congestion and distance you would have with getting land transport from the air ambulance in Moorabbin through to a hospital in central Melbourne could sometimes be the difference between life and death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the government for having a very proactive role in this and for saying that, when there is a master plan, they are going to have a good look at it to ensure that it maintains national and strategic interests. I say to the people who complain about aeroplanes flying over their heads: keep in mind that some of these aeroplanes are flying people whose life depends on it, and that country Australians do need to have access to city airports and that those slots do need to be available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also point out that in contrast to Sydney one of the things that has become a commercial advantage about Melbourne is that we don't have restricted landing hours. The planes can come in and out at different times. This has facilitated, in a significant way, the opportunity for agricultural and horticultural products to make their way out of Melbourne. The open skies policy, which the Australian government has, has been very beneficial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Out of my patch every night there would be a semitrailer load of asparagus that's trucked down to Melbourne Airport that's put in the belly of an A380 or a 777 and is largely sent to the UAE, and from there it makes its way into the markets. When I met with the CEO of Emirates airlines a while ago, one of the reasons they were flying, at that stage, out of Adelaide—even though they didn't have enough passenger movements, because they couldn't get enough passengers to fill the plane—was that they could get the plane to its maximum take-off weight on the back of agricultural products in the belly of those planes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the 24-hour access that's available in Melbourne has created more opportunity for exports of our nation and the restrictions on Sydney Airport have actually limited that. I find it quite interesting that we have people who put their hand on their heart and believe in having an open market where we have our ports open, such as our seaports, but they want to put restrictions on our airports, which also take our export goods as a nation. This is one of the reasons why Western Sydney plays a very critical role: it will allow us to have an additional spot for us to take our products to the markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that's also a concern to me, as a person who lives in a regional area, is even getting into Sydney—getting those slots for regional aircraft into Sydney Airport—has become more and more difficult, and has been sometimes some of the restrictions for opening up routes for servicing country Australians' access into our capital cities. That's another reason why it is good to see the government building a second airport in Sydney. It isn't just an issue for the people who live in Sydney; it's also an issue for the national competitiveness, and for the people who live in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will talk about the importance of general aviation and having general aviation access into airports such as Parafield, which I've flown into; into airports such as the Gold Coast, which I've flown into and will be flying into in a couple of weeks; and into airports such as Jandakot and Archerfield. The general aviation sector services not just business travellers but regional Australians that need to fly into those cities. One of the great challenges we've got if we are going to have safe, open and good air services for many years to come is that we need to be encouraging the general aviation sector, so that we have more pilots. Everyone who flies a big plane starts off in a little plane. I know it might sound like rocket science, but you usually start off in little Tecnam or maybe a 152 Cessna. Then you progress from there. Then you move your way up. The dream is to finish up flying the A380 Airbus, the A350 Airbus, the 777 or the Bart 787—'If it ain't Boeing, I ain't going', for those who believe in good American aircraft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It does concern me that the general aviation sector is being forced out of too many of our airports and that restrictions around ASIC cards have made life difficult for a lot of general aviation pilots, who have legitimate reasons, to be landing at the airports. We need to ensure that ownership of general aviation aircraft is affordable and that medicals are fair and reasonable. I think if we're not careful we'll get to a stage where we will be limiting our capacity to open up the opportunities for aviation, because we can't find enough pilots.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House. This is wise. We do need to have very strong and considered oversight when it comes to airports. They provide links for regional Australia for our agricultural products, our safety and our general aviation. This bill is going a long way towards that. I hope and trust that our government will continue to stand by general aviation so we can have a vibrant, prosperous regional Australia for many years to come.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  As a kid at Canley Vale High School, one of the books we had to read was the Charles Dickens classic <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Cities</span>. As a member of parliament representing the community where I grew up, I see another tale of two cities, which is nothing like the Dickens story of 18th-century London or revolutionary France, but it is serious and it's getting worse. I'm talking about the difference in life and opportunity depending on where you live—the difference in life and opportunity in different parts of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you an example. In the eastern suburbs of Sydney where the Prime Minister's electorate is, things are pretty good. Unemployment is low, at 1½ per cent. But if you go just over 20 kilometres away to my electorate, it's a different story. In Bankstown, the heart of my electorate, unemployment is currently at 11½ per cent. It's more than double the national average and about eight times what it is 20 kilometres away in the Prime Minister's electorate. It's the same story when it comes to how much people earn. In Vaucluse, in the Prime Minister's electorate, the average wage is more than $120,000, but in Auburn, in my electorate, it's less than one-third of that. It's less than $37,000. It's the same story when it comes to getting a pay rise. There hasn't been a lot of that in the last few years, but some people are doing better than others. In the Prime Minister's electorate, the average worker's salary has gone up by about $18,000 in the last ten years, but, in my electorate, it's only about a quarter of that. And it's the same story when it comes to the tax cuts passed last week. Some people are going to benefit a lot more than others. In Auburn, the average worker will get an extra $3.80 a week. In Vaucluse, the average worker will get an extra $39 a week—10 times as much. I repeat: $3.80 extra in Auburn and $39 a week extra in Vaucluse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what I mean when I'm talking about a tale of two cities—two towns that are barely 20 kilometres apart, but they might as well be on different planets, and they're growing further apart every day. And it's not unique to Sydney. You see this in other cities in Australia; you see it right around the country. It's not good. We've seen in the United States what happens when this sort of gap between rich and poor grows bigger. How do we turn it around? You don't do it by cutting penalty rates. In electorates like mine, more than 11,000 people rely on penalty rates to pay the bills and put food on the table, and, this weekend, penalty rates are going to be cut again. That just makes things worse. It increases the gap between richer and poorer Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're going to turn around this the tale of two cities and build a fairer country, then education is the key. As Paul Keating once said, 'Education is the key that opens every door.' But here's the problem: at the moment, kids from low-income families like those in my electorate are on average 2½ years behind kids from high-income families by the time they get to year 9, and only one in four kids from low-income families go on to university compared to two-thirds of young people from wealthy families. If education is the key to fixing the problem that I'm talking about here tonight, then it's not working—or, at least, it's not working as well as it could. We've got to make sure that more young people from places like my electorate go on and finish high school, go on to TAFE and get an apprenticeship or go on to university. What the government are doing at the moment is only making that harder. They've already cut more than $2 billion out of our universities. They've cut $3 billion out of TAFE, and, as a result, there are 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees today than there were five years ago. And they've cut $17 billion out of our schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate is going to vote soon on whether we should give the big four banks a $17 billion tax cut. If they pass those cuts, it shows just how out of touch this government is. Instead of giving the big banks a $17 billion tax cut, we should be putting that $17 billion into our schools in places like Bankstown and places like Auburn. That's the best way to build a fairer society, the sort of place where postcode doesn't determine opportunity. And that's exactly what we'll do if Labor win the next election.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Monday, 2 July marks my second year as the member for Boothby. Before I was elected, I worked hard to secure a range of key commitments to help my local community. Since my election, I have worked hard to fix problems and address issues for residents across my electorate. When the new boundaries for Boothby are introduced, I will work just as hard to deliver for the 38,000 new members of our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything I have achieved has been aimed at helping my local residents. I fought for and delivered road funding and rail projects, including $95 million for the Oaklands Crossing road and rail grade separation, $43 million to extend the Tonsley rail line to the Flinders Medical Centre and Flinders University, and $2 million for the Marion Road Planning Study. We will also soon see the conclusion of the $496 million federally funded Darlington upgrade. All of these projects will make sure that my residents spend less time stuck in traffic, whether they're going to work, getting their kids to school or just heading to the shops. They will also provide more public transport options. They will help people get to Westfield Marion, to the SA Aquatic &amp; Leisure Centre, to Flinders University and, most importantly, to Flinders Medical Centre faster and more safely.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Road safety and local roads have also been a concern of mine. I was pleased to work with the City of Holdfast Bay and the former mayor, Stephen Patterson, who is now the state member for Morphett, to deliver blackspot funding for the rail crossing at Jetty Road. This is just one of the smaller road upgrades that the Turnbull government is helping to fund around the Boothby electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout my time as the member and even while I was the candidate, I've asked my community how I could help them and have listened to them, and then I've helped them. Because of this, I helped community organisations reduce their power bills by securing funding to install solar panels at their facilities, their buildings and their club rooms. I worked with community leaders such as Andrew Chandler at the Seacliff Surf Life Saving Club, Chris Parsons at Brighton Surf Lifesaving Club and Mark 'Curly' Williams at Somerton Surf Life Saving Club to purchase solar panels. I worked with the Sturt CFS Group Officer, Dale Thompson, to see solar panels installed at the Blackwood, Belair and Eden Hills CFS stations. I did this because I listened to what my volunteers said they needed and because I want my local volunteers to focus on what they should be doing, which is keeping our community safe, rather than worrying about their power bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because I want my sports clubs to be able to attract as many members as possible and bring people together from all over my electorate, I fought for and secured funding for new club facilities because so many of my clubs were desperate for clubroom upgrades and for change rooms, especially for women. Working with the Blackwood Tennis Club, the Woods Panthers Netball Club and the Coromandel Cricket Club, we secured $400,000 for new change rooms and clubrooms at the Hewett reserve in Blackwood. In St Marys I worked with the Kenilworth Football Club to secure $350,000 for new facilities, and work is currently underway. In Flagstaff Hill, I worked with Michelle Crisp and Mel Ready from the centre's association, as well as Brett Charlesworth from the Flagstaff Hill Falcons footy club, to secure $400,000 to redevelop the entire community centre. The Warradale Park Tennis Club will soon have improved courts and lighting, with a $250,000 federal grant, and beachgoers will soon be safer at Seacliff with the installation of a new $150,000 watchtower for the club. I was also delighted to secure $200,000 for the upgrade of the Wirraparinga Trail Loop at Brownhill Creek and rehabilitation of the surrounding bushland, led by passionate community advocate Ron Bellchambers and others from the Brownhill Creek Association.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Together with my state Liberal colleagues, I campaigned for and helped secure $9 million of state funding towards the Women's Memorial Playing Fields at St Marys. The fields have a war memorial, but they are also a living memorial to Australian nurses and servicewomen who have given their lives for our nation. The fields are home to the Cumberland United Women's Football Club, the Sturt Lacrosse Club and the South Australian Women's Memorial Playing Field Trust, headed up by Bruce Parker OAM.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given more time, I could add to this long list of projects delivered for my electorate of Boothby, but I will conclude by saying that I look forward to continuing to fight for and deliver the projects that matter to my local residents. I will be a fierce advocate for everyone currently living in my electorate and those who will soon join our Boothby community under the new boundaries, and I look forward to continuing to listen to and work hard for every single member of my community.</span>

Over the past year, Prime Minister Hun Sen has launched a broad crackdown against the critical and independent voices in his country. This includes the arrest of the opposition leader Kem Sokha, accused of treason, followed by the dissolution of the main opposition party late last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Press freedom and civil society have also been under attack in the lead-up to these national elections, with the closure of several media outlets, including <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cambodia Daily</span> and Radio Free Asia as well as a number of NGOs who have been critical voices of this government. A dozen radio stations have been told they violated the broadcasting regulations for featuring opposition politicians or conducting licensed programming from Voice of America or Radio Free Asia. The National Democratic Institute, an NGO focused on civil participation, was told in late August that its foreign staff must leave the country within seven days and was ordered closed. Earlier this month the Asian Network for Free Elections, a regional election watchdog, released a report following an investigation by international observers into Cambodia's political situation. They concluded the upcoming elections are neither free nor fair. The report stated:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Merely going through the exercise of marking ballots does not constitute a free and fair election.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These restrictions on independent media and civil society are of great concern. Promoting a society where freedom of speech and freedom of association are protected can only promote the safety of people in an environment which will be beneficial to millions of Cambodians, but, alas, this is not occurring in Cambodia today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take the opportunity to raise the upcoming Australia-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue, to be held in Vietnam in August this year. Vietnam and Australia have a continued and developing relationship, strengthening our bilateral ties through trade, education and culture, and most recently signed a strategic partnership prior to the ASEAN-Australia summit last March. The dialogue is an important opportunity for Australia to build on these ties and have frank and candid discussions about human rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pleasing to note that Vietnamese authorities, following a strong international campaign, have released prominent human rights lawyer Nguyen Van Dai together with his colleague Le Thu Ha. They are now living in exile in Germany. However, it remains of concern that four other colleagues of the Brotherhood for Democracy remain in prison, serving lengthy terms under the vague national security laws. Following his release, Nguyen Van Dai contacted my office. He wanted to thank the Australian community for their support and went on to say that those advocating for multiparty democracy, freedom of association and freedom of expression in Vietnam are arrested. Their crime is attempting to overthrow the state. The recent crackdown on the Brotherhood for Democracy was the most severe in decades, with prison authorities carrying out all possible measures to harass political prisoners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I co-hosted the crackdown on freedom of expression in Vietnam forum along with colleague Tim Wilson MP as well as representatives from VOICE and Human Rights Watch. According to Elaine Pearson, the Australian director of Human Rights Watch, there are currently more than 140 Vietnamese political prisoners, with as many as 14 still in pretrial detention. As Australia fosters stronger ties with our regional partner in the Asia-Pacific, it's only proper that we play a more forthright role in promoting universal human rights. It's an imperative as an active member of the international community, particularly now, as we have a seat on the international Human Rights Council. This is even more important given the recent decision by the US to resign from its membership of the UNHRC. It is important Australia steps up to the task of exercising its responsibilities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise today to speak of the pressing need for the federal government to step in and make a real difference to the community of Mudgee and its surrounding districts. The Glen Willow Regional Sports Complex is a jewel in the crown of the Mid-Western Regional Council and the council area. To date, $13.8 million has been invested in the facility. It's the stadium where the region's great sporting contests are watched and savoured by the people of Mudgee, Gulgong, Rylstone, Kandos and the surrounding area. Glen Willow opened on Sunday, 22 April 2012, hosting the Country v City NRL fixture. The attending crowd was treated to a close match, with City just holding out Country, 24 to 22. I was there that day, and I recall the member for Hunter, who is in this House tonight, being there as well, and also Mudgee's favourite son, Ken Sutcliffe. That was a spectacle befitting this fine complex. It has served the community well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that time, it has generated $24.4 million in economic value and attracted almost 50,000 overnight visitors to the area. On any given day or evening of the week, you are likely to see players from the Mudgee Gulgong Wolves Football Club, the Mudgee District Netball Association or the Mudgee Black Swans Australian Rules Football Club and numerous other codes training or competing for victory. There has been the Waratahs v Brumbies trial matches, school-aged representative carnivals and seasonal fixtures for local sporting codes, all attracting thousands of visitors to the region each year. Recently, Glen Willow hosted the Dragons v Raiders NRL round 11 fixture, where the Dragons prevailed. In 2019, Glen Willow will welcome the Charity Shield between the Dragons and Rabbitohs, as well as a premiership match. The Central Coast Mariners also use the ground when they play their away games. As Brad Cam, the general manager of Mid-Western Regional Council, said recently:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I believe there's over 1000 touch players for the summer competition, 700 girls playing netball and the fields are used during the nights for training for AFL, Soccer, Rugby League—so it's a very well used ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stadium seats 10,000 people, with 1,000 of those under cover. It features competition-level lighting for night matches and a self-draining surface that allows play regardless of the weather conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the current facilities at Glen Willow are at capacity. The facility is heavily booked and highly utilised. This has put a handbrake on the community's ability to host additional events, host larger events such as the state football titles and accommodate more local sporting groups like the senior rugby union club. The community now seeks to take something that is very good and create something that is truly great. The plan is to turn this stadium into a regional centre of sporting excellence. What is proposed are new senior and junior club houses and amenity buildings, two additional senior rugby union and rugby league playing fields suitable for four touch fields, two multipurpose playing fields, two junior rugby league playing fields, lighting and additional car parking. Not only would the facilities be expanded; but the proposed project would promote economic growth and create jobs through increased sports tourism activity in the area. The council is also proposing to extensively landscape the surrounds of Glen Willow with pedestrian, cycling and running paths through the wetlands created from stormwater runoff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't matter what sport you prefer, whether it's soccer—preferably known as football—AFL, rugby league, union, touch, cricket, hockey, softball, baseball or netball, Glen Willow will facilitate all of these sports. It will also enable more members of the local community—I'm talking about kids, juniors and adults—to participate in sport and regularly play at top-class, all-weather, all-seasons facilities. Stage 1 of Glen Willow has been an outstanding success. It has been a truly worthwhile regional project, but it needs additional funding. It needs our support. It needs the support of the federal government, and I urge that support to be forthcoming.</span>

I think that that was the pretext to our very good city-country game. I am aware that Glen Willow needs a greater level of investment, and I look forward to the Turnbull-McCormack government investing in the project as we did as a Labor government. I send a cheerio to Des Kennedy, the mayor of the area, a great guy. I know that he's fighting for those improvements. I should say—and I'm not going to be as generous to the member for Calare as he was to me, and I apologise for my ungentlemanly behaviour—that if the member for Calare really wants to do something for his community, he could deliver the Regional Investment Corporation, something he promised his community. He claimed 200 jobs were involved. It's supposed to open on 1 July but, sadly, it has no CEO, no staff and no location. We'll see where that takes us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, I want to talk about our public broadcaster, the ABC. I'm glad the member for Shortland is here with me, because I know that he stands with me in defence of our public broadcaster as one of our critical institutions. In fact, the whole Labor Party is united in the cause to protect the independence of the ABC and to properly fund our ABC. For this reason, Labor moved a motion in parliament calling upon the Turnbull government to pledge that it will never support the privatisation of the ABC. Unfortunately, as you know Mr Speaker, that motion was voted down by the Turnbull-McCormack government. I know that that left many, many people disappointed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have grown up with the ABC, watching <span style="font-style:italic;">Play School</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bananas in Pyjamas</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and ABC Kids. ABC's Triple J <span style="font-style:italic;">Hack</span> program engages our youth in news and current affairs relevant to their lives and communities. For the last 20 years, the annual Heywire Regional Youth Summit has put Australians at the centre of the conversations that shape their communities. <span style="font-style:italic;">Landline</span> reporters around the country bring us up to date with the issues affecting rural and regional Australia—in particular, our agricultural sector. From farming to agriculture, food, economics, innovation and climate, the program presents important stories to a national audience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every week, 17 million of us still consume some form of ABC content. The first radio and TV services heard in the bush were courtesy of the ABC. Regional towns around the country still depend on the ABC for their local news, including we in the Hunter. In times of fire and flood, the ABC provides crucial services to rural and regional Australia, providing critical warning messages to the community. The ABC's emergency coverage in the Hunter was relied upon during the devastating 2016 April super storm and each scorching summer when bushfires threaten our local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2014, ABC funding has been cut by $366 million and 800 staff have lost their jobs. This is despite the Liberals' election promise of no cuts to our ABC or to SBS. This year alone, the government has cut $83.7 million from our ABC. They've launched two damaging public broadcasting inquiries and have three bills before the parliament which meddle with the ABC charter. We need to speak up before it's too late and to send a clear message of support to our public broadcaster. 'Hands off our ABC,' is the message.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 56,000 Australians are standing up for the ABC by signing Labor's petition to save our public broadcaster. It's an issue that's important to people in my local community, communities right throughout the Hunter and right throughout the nation. Labor believe that the ABC is one of the most important institutions and part of the fabric of our nation. It adds to media diversity and Australian content and plays a vital role in regional and remote communities, providing news and emergency information. I was pleased to meet Richard Roxburgh from <span style="font-style:italic;">Rake</span> this week, my favourite ABC show. Labor is committed to reversing the Prime Minister's unfair $83.7 million cut and guaranteeing stable funding for our ABC.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="74046" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOODENOUGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  The state of the housing market is important to many constituents of my electorate of Moore, which is located in Perth's northern suburbs in an area which is home to many established family houses and a significant population of retirees as well as being on the periphery of Perth's rapidly growing outer metropolitan area, which is the domain for many first home buyers. Indeed, the housing market is important to most families across Australia, who are carefully monitoring the policy direction of the government. Many homes in the suburbs are currently listed for sale on the market, with vendors facing anxious times and many professionals depending on the real estate industry to earn their livelihoods. On the one hand, a home represents the most significant financial asset for most people and is the product of a lifetime of saving and making mortgage repayments. It represents a significant proportion of the household wealth. Yet, on the other hand, housing affordability is an issue for many young Australians seeking to enter the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for the government is to implement sensible policies to ensure stability in the market with steady growth whilst maintaining housing affordability for the next generation of Australians through an increase in the supply of housing stock. Disciplined fiscal management, ensuring that wage growth is matched by productivity growth, helps keep inflation under control, which in turn takes pressure off interest rates. Maintaining low interest rates in this environment is important to ensure housing affordability for millions of Australians paying off their mortgages in our suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members would be aware that in Western Australia the property market has cooled significantly following a downturn in the state's mining industry, with housing prices relatively weaker than in the eastern states. A number of families in my electorate and beyond are facing financial hardship and the prospect of negative equity in their homes. Housing affordability policies intended for the eastern states' property market must not disproportionately affect Western Australia's housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm concerned that Labor announced it would tighten both negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, saving $565 million over the forward estimates and $32.1 billion over a decade. This policy measure will potentially affect housing supply and negatively impact average Australians by risking the value of their biggest asset. It will likely reduce the volume of new housing construction and raise rental prices. I refer to a report by RiskWise Property Research and WargentAdvisory which models the impact of Labor's proposed winding back of negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. The report is a detailed study of how the proposed measures would affect housing prices of 84 local government areas. It finds that impacts would vary markedly around the country, with prices in Western Australia projected to climb by up to seven per cent. Modelling by the firms suggests that changes would be equivalent to a sudden 1.15-percentage-point hike in interest rates, or the equivalent of more than four Reserve Bank of Australia rate hikes. For many borrowers, it would be equivalent to an increase in repayments of more than 20 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 8 January 2018, Treasury released a report saying that Labor's proposal for negative gearing would have little impact on housing prices. However, the analysis struck a note of caution that the policy could put some downward pressure on housing prices in the short term if its introduction coincided with the weaker housing market. A number of recent developments in the housing market must be taken into account, including local factors such as lower rates of unit development, a slowdown in construction, recent price falls, the recent regulatory crackdown on investor borrowing, a reduction in demand from offshore buyers, particularly from China, and concerns of a credit squeeze in the wake of the banking royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the coalition's policy of maintaining the status quo on negative gearing and the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount on assets held for more than a year will help maintain the stability of the property market. Maintaining a low-inflation and low-interest-rate environment will promote greater access and affordability for new homebuyers entering the housing market.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  Next week will mark two years since my election as the federal member for Burt. I have the huge honour of not just representing my community but being the first ever member for that area of Perth's south-eastern suburbs in that electorate. Being able to bring the concerns and the priorities of my community to this parliament on the national stage is terribly important and it's something that I take very seriously. It is why, in those two years, I've spent so much time working with my Labor colleagues on developing policy for a future Labor government; working with my colleagues across the aisle in committees, developing policy that even this Liberal government has seen fit to adopt; and speaking in these chambers about the issues that are important to my community. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I stood for election for the people of Burt I brought to them 10 positive policies for them to consider. Protecting Medicare: we've been able to stop the government from outsourcing Medicare, though they continue with their freezes. We said we would invest more money in our local schools, and Labor will invest by reversing the $17 billion of cuts to school funding by this government. We said we would build the Thornlie railway line and secure funding for extending that railway line through to Canning Vale, the Armadale Road duplication and a new bridge for Armadale Road at the freeway, and investing in replacing the Denny Avenue level crossing. In respect of all of those three things, I can say that through the pressure of the WA federal team, the Labor Party working with the new WA Labor McGowan government, we've been able to secure the funding for those projects as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we would stop the $100,000 university degrees that were being proposed by the Malcolm Turnbull government, and we have been able to do that. We said we would support a new state government making sure we had a 24-hour police station in Armadale, and that has been delivered as well. Critically, we said we would make sure there was a royal commission into the banks, and that has happened. It only happened because of the pressure that was applied by the Labor Party here in opposition in Canberra. I also said Labor would build a better NBN. Unfortunately from opposition there are only so many things that we can do, and building a better NBN and protecting people's penalty rates has not been able to occur because of the intransigence of this government not having the right priorities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to look to the future. What else is going to be able to be delivered? Labor will deliver bigger, better, fairer tax cuts for the people of Burt. Under this plan from Labor, 74 per cent of the people of Burt will be better off. We'll scrap up-front TAFE fees. Since 2013 we have 1,000 fewer people per year undertaking TAFE courses to get the skills they need. We will make sure it's easier for people to get to TAFE to get the skills and the jobs. We will protect people's penalty rates so they're not losing money by working on weekends. The 12,000 people working in the retail and hospitality sectors will have their penalty rates protected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Burt need a change of government now. They need to get rid of this Turnbull government and to see a Labor government to change the story for their benefit. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There were many important visits and announcements on the day. I want to focus on two special events that were particularly significant for my older constituents. The first event was a seniors forum that I hosted in Mt Gravatt. It was another great turnout. Over 70 Bonner locals attended. The minister's news of our record $5 billion investment in aged care and the extra 20,000 home care places that we're providing was very well received. Wishart local Muriel Mitchell said she learnt a lot of useful information about residential and home care.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Carindale local Paul Williams brought his father, Victor, along to hear what the minister had to say. They appreciated the minister's passion for finding new ways to improve aged-care services. They also appreciated the range of stallholders at the forum, which included My Aged Care and Brisbane South PHN. The minister also spoke about how we're investing over $100 million in mental health funding for older Australians. This is the largest ever single increase to mental health funding for older Australians. I'm proud to be part of a government that is delivering for older residents in Bonner. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second event was a meeting with a local Wynnum group that is doing great things for people living with dementia. The Dementia Awareness Advocacy Team is a wonderful group of people that are striving for a more dementia-friendly community. It advocates for people living with dementia and their care partners. It aims to raise awareness of dementia and reduce the stigma and stereotyping of this condition. The team provides dementia awareness training that has benefited many local businesses, including my own office. This training gives people a thorough understanding of what dementia is and how to relate to people living with dementia. It is a fantastic initiative, and I thank them for their great work. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased to see $5.3 million in the budget for dementia innovation, which will benefit people living with dementia. I thank the minister again for his visit and for speaking with my local constituents about their experiences with aged-care and mental health support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  At the heart of my electorate of Paterson lies the historic city of Maitland. Once upon a time, when the rivers were highways, Maitland was an inland metropolis. In fact, for a time, Maitland was Australia's second largest city. As the decades passed, Maitland evolved. It was an agricultural haven with its alluvial soils. It was the hub of early industries. It boasted grand buildings, bustling streets and a mighty river that was critical to it all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1955—as it had many times before and as it has since—that river turned on our people of Maitland. Torrential rain in the upper Hunter made its way into the river system. It's estimated the flood volume of the Maitland 1955 flood was four times that of Sydney Harbour. Thousands of homes were lost. Many lives were lost. Indeed, for many years on our telegraph poles we sported, high above the eye line of a young girl, the 1955 flood level. It was a constant reminder to us all of just how mighty that event was, and it burned into the psyche of many people who lived in our area. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The flood also swept away much of our city's history also. I believe Maitland is a city that deserves to remember its history. It was once home to Caroline Chisholm, whose work with convict women afforded her a place on our former paper $5 note. It's the birth place of legendary boxer Les Darcy. William Arnott, who brought us the famed Arnott's Biscuits, worked in Morpeth for 15 years as a baker. Thespians John Bell and Ruth Cracknell, both of whom have been given by the National Trust that wonderful title of living treasures, were born in Maitland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on, but my point is a city with such a rich and vibrant history deserves to have a place to recognise and celebrate that history now. It deserves to treasure its artefacts, and I'm delighted this soon may be a reality. There is a massive fundraiser underway to purchase a suitable property and create a permanent home for the Maitland Regional Museum. The vision, according to the museum, is to create a cultural hub. This initiative was launched last Friday night at the Maitland Regional Museum's fundraising dinner which was, I might add, held in beautiful Mansfield House. I am proud to say history will note that I am among the foundation supporters of Maitland Regional Museum's push to find a permanent home, and I urge everyone to get behind that initiative.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMillan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  Neerim District Health Service is a small rural hospital and aged-care service in West Gippsland. I was delighted recently to visit the Neerim District Health Service, meet with CEO Cate Graham and her team for a tour of the facilities and hear of their future plans for the facilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neerim District Health Service began as one of Australia's original bush nursing hospitals and is this year celebrating its 90th anniversary. Thirty years ago Neerim District Health Service was one of three dozen similar hospitals in country Victoria; today, it is one of our last four surviving original country community hospitals in Victoria. Those remaining have evolved to survive, but they all still have the same underlying Australian spirit of ensuring equality of access to care for Australian families, wherever they live, whatever their age, whatever their economic and social status. It is community-driven health care that many have forgotten, but it should still be celebrated and supported as government recognises that people need to be cared for where they live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, the Neerim District Health Service earlier this year was provided with a grant to upgrade aspects of the facilities. In comparison with some other grants, it may have appeared small and gone unnoticed. However, the dollar-for-dollar spend enables the health service to spend $300,000 on an upgrade which will attract new patients and residents and add aesthetic value for them during their time at the facility. These upgrades will provide aged-care residents with a new outdoor area, enhancements to the communal and social areas and a renovated kitchen that will be home-like, enabling residents to feel more at home. It was great to visit the hospital and hear how excited they are about the upcoming works and how passionate they are about providing health services to their local community. This is the reason that the Neerim health service has survived for 90 years: the fact that it is supported by a community that recognises the importance of the district's key health service provider, a major employer and important contributor to the local community and one of the district's central social links. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The service has revitalised itself in recent years. A new board of management and its clinical staff are determined to build its reputation as a small, skilled health service providing necessary local health services and specialised health services for a broader catchment. Neerim District Health Service's underpinning principle is that all Australians should have access to quality health services in the district where they live. I look forward to working with Cate, her team and the Neerim district community in order to assist them in continuing to deliver their important health services to the district well into the future. It is well known that I'm not very happy with the way health care has been provided by the last two governments, including this one. I believe there should be major changes made, especially to how we allocate beds and how we allocate the capital funds. Whoever takes the government reins at the next election, there needs to be change in this area. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  Colleagues, today I acknowledge, honour and thank the much loved former MP Lou Lieberman AM for his service to our nation, our state, our electorate of Indi and the community of Albury-Wodonga. Mr Lieberman served in the federal parliament as the member for Indi between March 1993 and October 2001. He was the member for Benambra in the Victorian parliament between March 1976 and August 1992. Mr Lieberman was the second member for Indi to have been the state member for Benambra, after Sir Isaac Isaacs. Whilst in the Victorian parliament he served as Assistant Minister for Health, Minister for Planning, Minister for Mines, Minister for Minerals and Energy and Minister for Local Government. During three terms in the federal parliament, Mr Lieberman chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Standing Committee on Publications. He was the parliamentary adviser to the United Nations General Assembly on 11 September 2001.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first speech to the federal parliament on 6 May 1993, Mr Lieberman said that regional development in Australia was the nation's 'most unrecognised issue'. I quote from his speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… unfortunately there has not been a national policy on it … Given the right regional policies, there are many parts of Australia like Indi that could do an enormous thing for Australia and create jobs … Regional Australian policies, in my view, should be absolute priority for all governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to Mr Lieberman's recognition of regional development, and I hope it will not be another 25 years before we can see action on regional Australia policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Lieberman is now in ill health and he has recently resigned as chair and member of Albury-Wodonga Health. In his time he has worked extensively in my community. He's been a director of the Hume Building Society. He has been on Albury's Mercy Health Service. He has served on the council of La Trobe University and recently chaired the Albury-Wodonga health service. I want to add in a little thankyou to Mr Lieberman, because when I was thinking of standing to be the member for Indi, I asked his advice. He said, 'Cathy, I wish you well but I have to say I will never support you, I'm a true-blue Liberal and I will always be that way.' He is a man of great loyalty—loyalty to his nation, to his community, to Indi. I wish Lou Lieberman a speedy recovery, a continued happy retirement with Marge and his extended family. On behalf of my electorate, I thank him for his community service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  Recently I spoke in the House about personal income tax cuts and company tax cuts. I spoke about a country that used to reward prosperity. Australia used to be a place where you could get ahead if you worked hard. I am evidence of that. I worked hard in my transport operations. I succeeded. I paid my tax. It is the dream of every Australian to work hard and aspire, to give it everything. But it is becoming increasingly evident that not everyone in this place believes in that. Labor doesn't believe in people who work hard, it would appear. Labor doesn't believe in people getting ahead. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BUCHHOLZ:</span>
                  </a>  I hear from the other side the word 'rubbish'. We put up a tax reform bill, and the member on the other side who just mentioned 'rubbish' voted against it. Labor voted against hardworking Australians getting ahead. If they get into government, they are going to introduce tax reform that punishes every person earning over $75,000. That tax bracket is the new elite, the new wealthy, for Labor. They are the people that are coming over. </span>

                  </a>  Good. And I would encourage you to table those numbers because I'm going to table these documents. The document I have in front of me is the OECD corporate tax rates. In front of Australia are Hungary, with under 10 per cent; and Ireland, 12 per cent. The Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia and the United States all have lower tax rates than us. Estonia, Finland, Iceland, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland and Turkey all have lower tax rates than us. Denmark, Sweden, Israel, Norway, Austria, Chile and the Netherlands all have lower rates than Australia. The United States, Luxembourg, Canada, Korea, Italy, New Zealand and Greece all are lower than us. Next are Germany, Mexico, and—boom!—then we get Australia. Guess who's behind us? Portugal and France. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we don't move in this space we will lose our international competitiveness. It is absurd to think that companies are going to come to Australia and make long-term investments of 20 years unless we make ourselves competitive. Those on the other side should be condemned because they are hamstringing this nation and crippling this country's growth. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  Last February, I raised matters in the House about the quality and rollout of the NBN in the electorate of Lilley. Since then, there has been no significant improvement. Since coming to government in 2013, Mr Turnbull and the Liberals have done just about everything possible to destroy the NBN. They’ve taken a world-class fibre-to-the-home network, which should have been completed by 2016, and turned it into 'fraudband'. Entire communities have been delivered a substandard service with low speeds and unpredictable connectivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor created the NBN to bring Australia into the 21st century and to make us competitive as an advanced nation. But this government has now put us decades behind. Around 20,000 fortunate households in Lilley have received Labor's first-class broadband. They've received fibre. But, across the rest of the area, there are approximately 40,000 premises that are receiving 'fraudband', mostly the old HFC network. Around 20,000 households in places such as Chermside, Chermside West, Geebung, Kedron, Northgate, Nundah and Wavell Heights have received absolutely nothing. Now they're falling even further behind, because the government has announced further delays because there are substantial problems with the HFC network. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who have been connected to the inferior HFC network, the problem is that speeds and services that were promised have not arrived, and people have been left in limbo. Some people have no service whatsoever. Some people have services that drop out. This is particularly the case in the bayside suburbs in my electorate. The standard HFC network has been more degraded in the bayside suburbs, leading to cost blowouts, long wait times and very, very poor service. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other problems faced across the electorate include faulty installations and missed appointments. Worse still, when trying to seek a resolution of the issue, people are experiencing blame-shifting between the NBN and telecommunications retailers. The NBN is too important for these problems to continue. That is why this week Labor have announced our NBN service guarantee to deliver a better experience for NBN customers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN service guarantee aims to address the problems with installations, fixing faults and missed appointments. Labor will set new standards for installations, repairing faults and missed technician appointments. We'll impose financial penalties on the NBN when these standards are not met and will impose strong penalties to protect small business from excessive downtime. Significantly for people in my community, these penalties will also result in compensation for wronged NBN customers, and the ACCC will have oversight of the guarantee to ensure its correct implementation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rolling rollout disaster of the NBN is a huge problem for people living in the northern suburbs of Brisbane and right across the country—for people who are operating businesses from home, for schoolkids who are trying to do their assignments and for families who are trying to do both these things at once or more. It short, it's been a disaster and it needs to be fixed.</span>

I had the pleasure of sponsoring this award category, which recognises outstanding community organisations, not-for-profits and charities that provide a significant social contribution to the Stirling community. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had the opportunity to visit the centre and congratulate the staff personally on their award and to see firsthand just how beneficial their services are. I would like to acknowledge the other finalists, the Edmund Rice Centre of WA and the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre, which are both fantastic not-for-profit organisations that support the Stirling community as well. During my time as the member for Stirling, I've had the privilege of working with each of those organisations, whose staff go above and beyond their regular business duties for the benefit of others. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Black Swan Health was established in 2014 and offers tailored medical, mental health and disability services to hundreds of Western Australians each day to achieve the best health outcomes for all of them. Emerging from changes in the funding and service delivery model for primary health care over 2015-16, Black Swan Health acquired all service delivery programs previously provided by the Panorama Health Network and One Healthy Community. In late 2015 they were also awarded the Healthy Lifestyle program contract by WA Health, in recognition of their success in delivering exceptional health programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the organisation's many services include their Partners in Recovery program, which delivers support for people with severe, persistent mental illness with unmet needs, their carers and their families.  Black Swan Health also deliver headspace clinics and continue to embrace the needs of young Australians with the development of the free app based service called YAppEE. This service assists young people with mental illness to remain employed in those times when the illness makes it more challenging for them to feel motivated at work. Through the app, young people undertake daily check-ins with a mental health professional and receive a timely response, helping them to deal with the issue as soon as it arises. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Stirling Business Awards are just one of the many accolades won by Black Swan Health over the past two years. In 2017 they won two categories at the WA Disability Support Awards, including Excellence in Advocacy and Rights Promotion, as well as awards at the Fremantle Business Awards and the North West Metro Business Awards. With almost 80,000 occasions of service in the last financial year, Black Swan Health has made a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of the community of Perth, and that is expected to grow significantly in coming years. I'd like to thank executive director Terina Grace and her staff for their many achievements and wish the organisation every success for the future.</span>

He's a 73-year-old man who's got a pacemaker because of his heart problems. He's an ex-policeman and someone who makes a great contribution to our community. As well as all of those things, he's someone who has grave concerns about the NBN. He connected to the NBN last year. Before that he'd always been a Telstra customer. But he made the arrangements to move over to the NBN. Ever since then his phone and internet have been dropping out. One of the problems with the NBN is the unreliability of landline connections for people who have NBN connections. As I said, Mr Bones has a pacemaker, and he's worried about his own health. He lives on his own and he relies on his phone to communicate with his friends and family, and to have access to emergency numbers if needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Bones is also worried about reliability issues with his home communications because, as I said, he's a retired policeman who is really engaged with the community. He gives his time to the families of other retired police men and women, and retired service men and women, and when someone passes away—a retired service man or woman or police man or woman—he provides support to the families. He helps with funeral arrangements. His phone being diverted to MessageBank because of the unreliability caused by his connection to the NBN has meant that he missed an important call to attend an ex police officer's funeral and he was unable to assist that family. He's been very stressed about being put in this situation. He's been in touch with my office on a number of occasions to talk to us about the concerns that he has in respect of the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had so many worries and concerns raised with us about the NBN. There are the telephone and landline issues, obviously. I have heard from an academic who does a lot of his work online and is just incredibly frustrated by the reliability issues. It's time to establish an NBN service guarantee. Labor have committed to delivering a better experience for NBN consumers, with an NBN service guarantee that will set regulated time frames and wholesale service standards for fault rectification, for installations, for missed appointments. There will be penalties that apply if service standards are not met. To properly safeguard consumers, penalties will increase in response to excessive downtime, with appropriate compensation caps to apply. If NBN Co don't meet these standards, they'll be liable, and the impacted consumer will be fairly compensated. It's that simple. A Shorten Labor government would also establish stronger penalties to protect small businesses on the NBN, because we understand the stress and financial harm caused by the loss of telephone or internet services. It's time for Australians to have broadband that they can rely on, and Labor will deliver that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  Not everyone lives within 10 minutes ambulance ride of a hospital, but medical emergencies can strike anyone at any time. For the almost 30 per cent of Australians who live outside of capital cities, responders like CQ Rescue helicopter service are a lifeline in times of need. This service provides rapid response critical care and airlifting services every minute of the day. CQ Rescue has already completed more than 300 missions this year. In the past week, missions have included emergency flights to mining towns such as Moranbah and Clermont, as well as to Collinsville, to airlift a person injured in a car accident, and to the Whitsundays, to retrieve a tourist who had suffered a fall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't imagine living without the CQ Rescue service today, but it only began in the mid-1990s. In 1992, Mount Isa Mines donated the use of its helicopter for medical emergencies, and it was used 190 times in three years. But a multi-vehicle traffic accident near Lake Elphinstone, where patients were transferred to Mackay Base Hospital, highlighted the need for a dedicated helicopter service. The service created from that first meeting has gone on to fly over 8,000 missions, saving lives and providing help when it is most needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With operational costs of more than $8.6 million a year, the CQ Rescue service needs to raise $5 million on its own every year, and it does that mostly from the local community. During its history of more than 20 years, the service has relied heavily on sponsorships and community donations but also on the dedicated service of many individuals. In 2013, eight crew members past and present were awarded the National Emergency Medal, for their work during a natural disaster. In 2014, volunteer coordinator the late Bob Sim, a personal friend of mine, received an Order of Australia medal, for his service to the community. In 2015, founding board member Dr Peter Bastable received the Mackay Regional Council Australia Day Citizen of the Year award, for his 25 years of meritorious service to this organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago, the Deputy Prime Minister and I visited the service headquarters of CQ Rescue and met with CEO Ian Rowan. Ian has spent more than 20 years in the military, emergency management and public safety realm. He heads a team of 10 administrative staff and 16 helicopter crew and engineers. Many have come out of a military background and are continuing their service to the nation and community via CQ rescue. We spent some time discussing the service requirements of CQ rescue and its plans for future expansion. The Deputy Prime Minister was impressed by the professionalism of the team and the community's strong support for CQ rescue. It's an essential part of the community in Central and North Queensland, and I'm going to do whatever I can to support it in the future.</span>

                  </a>(<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  Nestled in the leafy and quiet streets of Northcote in my electorate of Batman, soon to be called Cooper, is a jewel of community hubs. I refer to Jika Jika Community Centre. On arriving at this gem of a place you are welcomed by a lovely courtyard colourfully painted by community members. They tell you that at Jika Jika you can develop friendships, find support, exchange ideas, learn new skills and become more involved in the community. The effervescent and thoughtful Gina Wittingslow runs the centre with care and concern for her community. Her deep commitment is reflected in the programs, showing her understanding of what the people around her need: art and recreation classes, language classes, choirs, basic computer skills and, for the more advanced or newly minted microbusiness folk, MYOB courses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jika Jika offers inclusion and friendship through dance classes, and there is one for everyone. From ballet for the babies to tap and bop for the energetic, there is a dance for all abilities and those with special needs. Playgroup, child care and young family programs are plentiful, meeting so many needs and helping new mums and not so new mums with all the challenges faced by growing families. There are music lessons that range from gypsy and world music orchestra to violin lessons, Caribbean drumming and Celtic jam sessions. There is indeed something for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The beauty of neighbourhood houses like Jika Jika lies in the fact that they bring the community together, who then determine what is important to them and what their needs are and set about delivering them. The impacts are far reaching and include reducing isolation, developing much-needed skills and keeping communities robust. I am so lucky, because my seat is home to a network of neighbourhood houses. They have at their core a social justice framework underpinned by community development principles, listed as community ownership, community participation, empowerment, access and equity, lifelong learning, inclusion, networking, advocacy, self-help and social action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neighbourhood houses are true grassroots organisations that rely on the community and hard-working staff to deliver their programs—like those at the Reservoir Neighbourhood House, who know only too well that inclusion and dealing with social isolation actually saves lives. Reservoir Neighbourhood House has always provided wonderfully inclusive programs like support projects for parents caring for children or young people with a disability or children with Asperger's. They offer counselling and help for people with depression or anxiety, and for people on Centrelink and on low incomes in partnership with another great organisation in Batman—Diverse—they offer a vital free tax-advice service. Unlike so many community organisations, Reservoir Neighbourhood House provides cheap and nourishing lunches along with cooking classes and free bread days in a community pantry. I congratulate Angie and her wonderful staff for keeping the house alive and thriving with minimal resources. It's organisations like our neighbourhood houses that desperately need our support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge all the worthy O'Connor recipients of Queen's Birthday honours, which were announced on Western Australia Day. I'd like to give particular acknowledgement to my friend Peter Aspinall OAM, who has been recognised for his exceptional service to veterans and their families. After a long and prestigious military career, which included service in Vietnam, notably as an artilleryman with the 6th Battalion in the Battle of Long Tan, Peter returned to Albany and became active in the Returned and Services League. Peter was for many years President of the RSL Albany sub-branch and has served on the board of RSL WA since 2008. He is now President of RSL WA but still lives in Albany. Together with Albany's Geoff Hand and Laurie Fraser, Peter was instrumental in developing the concept of both the National Anzac Centre and the 2014 Albany Centenary of Anzac commemorations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first met Peter in 2011, when he was chair of the Albany Centenary of Anzac Alliance. Geoff, Laurie and Peter shared a vision to re-enact the first convoy of Australian and New Zealand troops departing for Egypt to train for the campaign at Gallipoli. Their incredible vision came to fruition on 1 November 2014 with a nationally recognised event commemorating the departure of more than 41 warships carrying over 30,000 troops and 8,000 horses. Six warships and a submarine were involved in the re-enactment, with over 40,000 spectators from all over Australia attending the four days of commemorations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These commemorations included a massive all-schools and armed forces march and ceremony at the Anzac Peace Park, addressed by Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove; a moving dawn service; a beach concert overlooking 30,000 poppies in the sand at Middleton Beach; the presentation of the Legion of Honour by the French ambassador to two of Albany's most recognised war veterans, the Maxton brothers, who flew with Bomber Command over Europe in World War II; and the opening of the National Anzac Centre by then Prime Minister Tony Abbott and then New Zealand Prime Minister John Key.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Anzac Centre is an amazing legacy of Peter's hard work. It takes visitors on an emotional interactive journey, assuming the identity of one of 32 actual service men and women on their journey from Australia to the battlefields of World War I and their ultimate fate. In its first year of operation, more than 90,000 locals and tourists took this poignant journey into Australia's Anzac heritage, and the National Anzac Centre will remain one of Albany's most visited attractions for many generations to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my privilege to be asked by another legendary WA veteran, Graham Edwards, former member for Cowan, in his capacity as the then president of RSL WA to be co-sponsor and referee in support of Peter's nomination for this honour. It gives me great pleasure to close by thanking Peter for his incredible contribution to veterans and our nation's heritage and to congratulate him on being awarded this well-deserved Order of Australia medal.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MIKE KELLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  It is a great privilege for me to report on the meeting I had on 15 June with my wonderful local advocates from the JDRF who are fighting the great battle in the cause of juvenile diabetes research—wonderful local people like Mel and her son Lawrence, who has been public as a four-year-old boy who is leading the charge on fundraising in this cause, and Rhianna and her beautiful daughter Cassie. I almost felt like a godfather to Cassie, as I watched her grow up and saw her fighting her struggles with diabetes type 1. There is a lot of work to do to make sure the community understands there is a big difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This is not a lifestyle issue; this is a genetic issue. We have a lot of work to do to continue our battles. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Eden-Monaro, we have 9.9 per cent of National Diabetes Services Scheme registrants—a higher rate than the national rate. Overall, 122,300 Australians are fighting the type 1 diabetes battle every day. We have made progress. Life expectancy was limited, with people dying in their 40s, but now we are pushing that out into the 60s with the effort that has gone on. It has been a great, bipartisan effort right across the board, going back to when we were in government, in getting the clinical trial network funded and changes to eligibility for federal government carers allowance. Then, of course, there was the funding for insulin pumps and the subsidies from 2008 carrying forward to the current government's support for the clinical research networks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are only in the early stages of a lot of this battle, and it is important that when the clinical research network funding expires in June 2019 next year we move into phase 3 of that project. Already, we've seen great benefits from it: 1,500 people with type 1 diabetes are accessing new therapies and enhanced care. There are 1,400 families engaged in this world-leading project on prevention. We are getting benchmarking of clinical outcomes for over 10,000 patients out of phases 1 and 2 of the clinical research network. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important we move on to the third stage of this network. It probably will require about $50 million of funding, but it is kicking goals. It is a terrible disease which has really crimped the lifestyle of not only the kids who are affected by this but the families who struggle through it. We have seen, not only in relation to the technology around the insulin pump for kids but now in the development of apps that allow teachers and other carers to remotely monitor the levels of these kids, a bit of liberation in the way the kids are able to go to school and be looked after by other people. I thank these advocates, and we need to push for the next stage.</span>

It was a great presentation that was very well attended. St Christopher's is a very strong club in our community and it has been in existence for some 35 years. On the day, I presented Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards to Matthew Fitzgerald, Daniel Louka, Ryan Klem, Thomas Forrester, Thomas Tiberti and Raoul Konia, all of whom had remarkable achievements. There was a hat-trick in there and several centurions. There were fantastic achievements from the kids at St Christopher's Cricket Club. I'd like to thank the club's President, John Clay, Vice-President Paul Collins, Secretary Andrew Divan and Treasurer John Grealy for everything that they do to create such a special club in our community. I'd also like to thank Panania Diggers—Gary Murray and everyone at Panania Diggers—for their ongoing support of not just St Christopher's Cricket but so many sporting clubs in our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 12 June, I attended the Oatley Lions Club board meeting. There was a lot of planning going on for this year's spring event—the Oatley Village Festival. It's a big event in our community every year, and, for some 20 years, Bryan Pirie has been organising it along with his fellow Lions. Oatley Lions is a very important group in our community. Many thousands of people attend the annual festival, and the club has raised more than $170,000 in the last five years for local and international community projects. This year the festival will be held on 20 October, and the club is expecting over 180 food, craft and variety stalls and lots of local performers as well. Thanks to Bryan Pirie for all his efforts, and congratulations to the new club President, John Morgan, the Vice-President, Richard Sheahan, and Secretary, John Perkins, for all the work that they do at Oatley Lions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 June, I attended the Oatley Probus Club. It was great to catch up with the members, President Annie Organ, Secretary Lesley Mannion and the many other volunteers who are involved in this Probus club. Right across the Banks electorate, we have a very active Probus community—very active indeed. Probus is all about friendship, fellowship and fun, and all of those things were in evidence on this day at Oatley Probus. The group has a monthly meeting with guest speakers and lots of outings. There's a regular walking group; there are theatre parties and a lot more. Thanks to everyone at Oatley Probus for their efforts in our community, and thank you also to the broader Probus community in our area.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  Today I rise to pay tribute to two outstanding local residents whom I have the privilege to represent as the member for Greenway. They've been awarded Queen's Birthday honours this year. Ken and Marj Freeman of Lalor Park, who live down the road from where I grew up, have been awarded Order of Australia medals for their service to the community of Blacktown. Ken and Marj are long-term locals. They moved to the Blacktown area in 1966, and, since that time, they have been active members of our local community. I think it's accurate to say that Ken and Marj live and breathe Blacktown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their local community involvement began in 1966, the year <span style="font-style:italic;">Play School</span> first aired on Australian television, with a quest and, ultimately, a campaign to install street lighting on what was then a semirural street. My house at this time, of course, was also in a virtually semirural area. I think it was chicken farms, and now, of course, it's all houses. Their involvement with the Blacktown community since that time spans many decades with service to countless community organisations. Their work has included service to Blacktown Meals on Wheels from as far back as 1970 and volunteer efforts with the Probus Club of Blacktown City, which are still going on today. This is in addition to an ongoing involvement with the fantastic Blacktown Relay For Life, the Cancer Council and the 'Simply Voices' Blacktown Seniors Choir, who are absolutely amazing. Their involvement with the 'Simply Voices' choir is in visiting local nursing homes to bring joy and happiness to others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marj is also a survivor of breast cancer, and I pay tribute to her for that. She was first diagnosed at the age of 38, and the fact that she is still going strong is a testament to her determination and also to Ken's support. They've been determined, of course, to continue helping others alongside their own personal trials, and that's a true testament to their great character. It's so fitting that one of our highest national honours is bestowed upon those who strive always to serve their local community with such dedication and without fanfare. They've never sought the spotlight, and I think we can all say that, as we observe the qualities in our local residents who receive these honours, that would have to be one of the most consistent values. Quite simply, they do it because they love to help people and they are simply lovely people themselves. I'm so proud to acknowledge the service of Ken and Marj in the Chamber today. I thank them most sincerely on behalf of all of the Blacktown community for helping us to thrive and prosper. I am very certain they will continue to make an impact on the lives of those around them, particularly older Australians in our area. Congratulations, Ken and Marj, on being awarded Order of Australia medals in recognition of your dedicated, ongoing service to the Blacktown community. I look forward to your involvement for many years to come. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CREWTHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I greatly appreciate that acknowledgement. Firstly I want to speak today about Jubilee Park in my electorate in Frankston. Last week the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government, the Hon. Dr John McVeigh and I met with the Mayor of Frankston City Council, Councillor Colin Hampton, to talk about the project at Jubilee Park. Minister McVeigh has been very involved with the Dunkley electorate, as many of my projects, whether they are under the Stronger Communities Program, the Community Development Program, election commitments or something else, fall within his portfolio. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My ongoing advocacy for grassroots sports facilities in Dunkley is reflected in the many of the meetings I have had with ministers, and having the mayor join us accelerated our discussions about how we can continue to support our local basketballers, netballers, indoor cricketers and footballers at Jubilee Park and also through other sporting projects across the electorate, whether they be expansion works, change room rebuilds to enable more female participation in sport, and more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting your mention of Zac in my electorate, he is a young person who is aspiring to go into politics, but sporting facilities in electorates also help young people generally to engage in the community. This prevents disengagement, whether they are trying to engage in education, employment, community activities and more. But it is very important across the electorate for young people. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the proposed plans of Jubilee Park, funded under $350,000 I committed in June 2016, present some amazing opportunities for a number of different sporting clubs and young people in my community. I have seen the designs for the Jubilee Park Master Plan, which is looking fantastic, and acknowledge that our funded plan has now resulted in $7.1 million being committed by council. The plans account for facilities that will benefit many local sporting codes, from netball to basketball, indoor cricket and football, as well as the Frankston RSL. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to have advocated on behalf of the community for this project. This project will benefit hugely from $5.2 million of budgeted funding that I have been working with the minister and his department to keep in our region following our proposal from council for this project. I'm also fighting for extra funds to contribute to the overall $31 million Jubilee Park Master Plan project. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our electorate needs these facilities, and our players deserve them. This project will also be assisted by additional car parks around the facility as well as the $228 million in the recent budget I've secured towards the extension of the metro rail from Frankston to Baxter, which will involve a station servicing Karingal that will be very near Jubilee Park and will provide a service to this wonderful facility. I have consulted with many community groups, canvassed the community and met with council and stakeholder groups. I am working closely with Minister McVeigh and thank him for his support so far not only for Jubilee Park but for facilities across my electorate. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I want to take the opportunity to speak out on behalf of close to 100,000 aged pensioners in the Illawarra, the South Coast, the Shoalhaven and the Southern Highlands areas in which I live, represent and am fighting for. Since May 2014 they have been victims of quite a silent but effective war on their livelihoods by this government. The attacks, indirect, on their livelihoods and wellbeing—freezing Medicare rebates, cutting hospital spending and attacks on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—are bad enough. When you look at the cuts to indexation proposed in the 2014 budget and continued since then, the attack on deeming rates, which have not kept pace with the changes in the broader market and are affecting part-pensioners, and the plan to axe the $14-a-fortnight energy supplement as power prices go up and up and up, these initiatives are bad enough. But the big one that has people hopping mad is the plan by this government to make Australia have the highest retirement age of any of the countries that we like to compare ourselves to—higher than the United States, higher than Canada and higher than Great Britain. They want to make 70 the retirement age in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to cite a good citizen from the Illawarra: one Bobby Turner. He went to sea at the age of 14 and knows what hard work is. And he nailed it. He said, 'Only a bloke who has worked as a merchant banker for his entire life thinks that you can work to the age of 70 and not have your body break down on you.' Bobby knows what it's like to work with his hands and his back his entire life, and he's sending a message to the Prime Minister that this plan is just not on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been contacted from residents right throughout my electorate. David from Dapto has worked with his hands, physically, all his life. He's sore and tired at the age of 54. Samantha from Berrima believes that many jobs have workloads which put too much stress on our bodies and that 'no-one wants to employ older people' these days anyway. And David from Horsley said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Some jobs are too hard to go to 70, e.g. bricklayer, teacher, policeman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd add nursing to that list and many, many others. So we're calling on the government to think again and reverse this reckless plan. We are a better country than this. People who've worked with their bodies all their lives know that some of us can work to the age of 70, but many, many of us cannot. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  The City of Greater Shepparton has been embarking on a revitalisation of its CBD. The council has seen the need for older infrastructure and streetscapes to be reworked and revitalised so that customers can come to the business centres and help some of our business owners. The first stage of this revitalisation was the upgrade of Vaughan Street. Vaughan Street is now a much busier and more vibrant business centre, having taken advantage of the new and improved access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next stage of the council plan is the Maude Street bus interchange upgrade. This Shepparton bus interchange upgrade is going to take the interchange from where it is, push it slightly further down Maude Street and create new infrastructure—new amenities and new toilet blocks—and better access to the train station and shops. The buses are a big part of transport for many people throughout the area, and this revitalisation is certainly going to put Shepparton into a much better phase. The project is going to have significant benefits for those who use the buses, especially those on lower incomes, by providing access to employment and stimulating other investment, which is crucial to the lower end of Maude Street. It will certainly be beneficial to new migrants. When they first arrive in Australia, many of them don't have access to motor vehicles and they use the buses exclusively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment in this project is around the $5 million mark, and the Greater Shepparton City Council has an application in front of Minister McVeigh right now for the Building Better Regions Fund. We are very keenly waiting to see if this application will be successful. The first stage will be an eight-bay bus interchange to help with more friendly transport, and direct access to the CBD and the train stations, as I just said. There will also be additional CCTV monitoring, which will hopefully make the area a lot safer than it would otherwise have been. There will be demolition of the existing structures and amenities during this current stage, but once it moves further on there's going to be further works around the whole CBD of Shepparton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's acknowledged that the area is tired. It's acknowledged that we have too many vacancies. It's acknowledged that there's too much development going on on the outskirts of town. Sometimes Australian cities want to follow the American lead as opposed to more of a European look. I think we've got to really look after our CBDs. If we can get funds like the Building Better Regions Fund to invest in regional cities like Shepparton, it will be a great thing for Australia's future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  When this government attacks TAFE, the pain is felt disproportionately in the Hawkesbury. Twenty-seven per cent of people in the Hawkesbury have a TAFE qualification—that's almost double the rate of Greater Sydney. TAFE is part of who we are. Richmond TAFE, including its horticulture, animal and equine courses, is a cornerstone of the Hawkesbury. Many of our children aspire to master their vocation, to be self-employed, to employ other up-and-coming masters of their trades and to train up apprentices. TAFE forms a backbone of our local economy and its importance should not be under-estimated. But the Turnbull government really couldn't care less. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' record on vocational education is abysmal, with cuts of more than $3 billion from skills and apprenticeships. The contrast between Labor and Liberals when it comes to TAFE could not be starker. They wasted $24.1 million on a disastrous and now abandoned five-year apprenticeship IT system upgrade, and they are now required to spend another million-plus just to maintain the current capability of the original 1999 system. Apprenticeships have continued to decline. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor care about TAFE. We want to invest in it. We want to build it up. We value the role it plays in our communities. We'll scrap up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students learning trades that Australia desperately needs. We'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities. We'll guarantee that at least two out of every three Commonwealth training dollars go to TAFE and make sure one in 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices. We'll provide 10,000 pre-apprentice programs for young people who want to learn a trade, and we'll provide 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers to retrain. We choose not to give money to the bankers and big businesses at the top end of town. We choose to invest in TAFE, to invest in education, to invest in skills and training. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently joined Richmond High School to raise funds and awareness for Red Nose Day, which aims to eradicate sudden infant death syndrome. The school started fundraising for Red Nose Day in 1998, 30 years ago. Since 1997, Richmond students and staff have been making formations on the school oval, with the New South Wales Police PolAir flying over and taking a photo of it. There's been a giant spider, an elephant and a kangaroo, all with big red noses. As in previous years, I joined students as they arranged themselves into the outline of this year's picture—a baby with a giant red nose. Congratulations to the SRC and school captain Noah Riley, who sent me the invitation to be involved. A special mention goes to Pat Pilgrim, who's been in this from the start. Over the years they've raised nearly $500,000. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Nearly 400 volunteer lifesavers from the 15 clubs across the Central Coast got together recently to celebrate another successful season at the Surf Life Saving Central Coast Awards of Excellence night. This season saw 513 lives saved, 17,970 preventive actions and 1,775 first aid cases, all by local volunteer surf lifesavers, over 96,300 patrol hours, so there was plenty to celebrate. With more than 8,000 volunteer members, our surf clubs do a fantastic job in helping to keep our beaches safe. I'd like to thank every member of a local surf lifesaving club for volunteering their time for the benefit of our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge some particularly exceptional volunteers from my electorate of Robertson. Open Athlete of the Year and Young Athlete of the Year was Jemma Smith from Umina Surf Life Saving Club. Dave Thompson from Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club won Official of the Year. Assessor of the Year was Ashley Capps from Copacabana Surf Life Saving Club, and Facilitator of the Year was Ramzy Fawzy from Wamberal Surf Life Saving Club. Oscar Crowe from MacMasters Beach Surf Life Saving Club was awarded a Newcastle Permanent Junior Lifesaver of the Year award. Rookie of the Year went to Zara Smithers from Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club, and Matt Calbert from Ocean Beach Surf Lifesaving Club won Young Lifesaver of the Year. North Avoca Surf Life Saving Club took out two major awards at the ceremony: Matt Slattery, the club president, won the prestigious title of Lifesaver of the Year, and Darren Hutton was named Patrol Captain of the Year. Both Matt and Dean were acknowledged for their outstanding commitment to their club and their community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My own club, Terrigal Surf Life Saving Club, won a number of awards, and I was really proud to see the club named Overall Surf Sports Pointscore winners. Paul Lemmon won Masters Athlete of the Year, Tim Pittolo was awarded Trainer of the Year and the outstanding Cathy Cole was named Volunteer of the Year for her wonderful presentation about our female surf lifesavers during World War II. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Umina Surf Life Saving Club had an incredibly successful season and was recognised for this on the night, taking out the top honour of Club of the Year. MacMasters Beach Surf Life Saving Club and Ocean Beach Surf Life Saving Club won second and third, respectively, which was an outstanding achievement. To everyone at Umina: congratulations. To President Bill Cook and the whole team, thank you for all you do for our community. Club of the Year wasn't the only award Umina took home. Jarryd Edmonds was named rescue craft operator of the year, Trevor Gee was named Coach of the Year and the club won Team of the Year with the under-19 female surf team—congratulations to Jemma Smith, Mollie Murphy, Jasmine Darwin, Jazmyn Rodwell, Rachel Wood and Mimosa Henderson. The president of Surf Life Saving Central Coast, Stuart Harvey, has told me that the awards night culminates the season for its 15 surf lifesaving clubs and it's a chance to recognise all volunteer members. I place on record my thanks to the surf lifesaving movement, Chris Parker, Stuart Harvey and each and every member of the local surf clubs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">):</span>  I have the extraordinary privilege of representing the electorate of Lalor in the people's house. It is going on five years since I was elected to this place to represent the community I was born in, the community I was raised in and the community where I raised my family. It's a diverse and growing community, as I've said here often. We're now at 88 babies being born every week. We're currently at a population of over 250,000 people, with projections for the City of Wyndham's population to increase to 435,000 by the year 2036. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people in my community are people who are attracted to our affordable housing—people who come to start their lives. We have what we call the old city, if you like, and then we have the growth that is attracting people from around the world. That means people in my community work incredibly hard at building their communities, small and large. It means that our schools work incredibly hard at developing culture, as well as developing academic capability and developing creativity in our students. It means that in our schools we work every day on building great citizenship, building great communities and building a great society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was thrilled in the break we've just had to attend Tarneit Senior College to meet some young people there who are going into the Victoria Youth Parliament. The Tarneit Senior College team of Agnes, Jumess, Khaled, Arpan, Raiane and Aisha have been hard at work drafting their bill to promote rooftop gardens on inner city buildings. It was a pleasure to meet with them. Next week, they will join 20 teams from across Victoria to debate their bill and others in the chambers of the Victorian parliament. It will be a pleasant change to become an observer in the parliament next week and to go and listen to them as they present their speeches and learn so much about our democracy in the process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who worked as a teacher in the electorate for over 20 years, I'm incredibly proud to see these young people engaging in the way they are. But the proudest moment was when the formalities were finished and the discussion was done and I had a chance to chat quietly to those students on their own. They wanted to talk to me about how proud they are of their community and how overwhelmed they felt over the January period when we were verballed by the state opposition, verballed by our Prime Minister and verballed by senior ministers, because our community was in the news for some other young people's terrible behaviour. These students wanted to say to me how much it means to them to be a member of that community and how proud they are of their efforts. One person said to me that when she's at family gatherings in other parts of the city and they're talking about their lives and aspirations and the things they're doing at school and cousins say to her: 'So where are you going to school?' and she says, 'Tarneit,' people get a look on their face. She said, 'It just makes me more determined to make this the best place to live.' That's what I'm proud of about my community—their fighting spirit. I applaud their fighting spirit, particularly when I think about what this government has managed to do to my community over the five years that it has been in power, when I think about what's gone missing from our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about the failings of this government when it comes to young people in communities like mine, I think of the students that I met two weeks ago who will, hopefully, be off to university next year, and I think about the $2.2 billion cuts to universities across this country and what they mean locally. I think about the $270 million cut from TAFE, on top of the $3 billion already cut from TAFE, and I think about these young people and their opportunities. This is what I think about when I think about aspiration. Aspiration, for me, means that those young people can aspire to be the best they can be, by getting themselves an education, and can aspire to live in a society that is fair, to live in our great egalitarian Australian dream. I think of those young people and the $17 billion that is being cut from schools and what that means to Tarneit Senior College, going forward over the next two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think about what this government has failed to address, which is the housing affordability crisis. My area is known as being an affordable place, but the average price of a house in Wyndham Vale is now $450,000. That may not seem a lot to those who live on the North Shore of Sydney, but $450,000—in what is supposed to be the most affordable suburb in Melbourne—is beyond young people's reach. Young people in my community deserve better. Young people in my community deserve a government that will address housing affordability, that will take brave decisions like the Labor Party has in terms of the way it will address that. It will address that by making things more equitable, by allowing young people to be in a position to afford a house because they'll be able to accrue their penalty rates again, because they will be able to get the education that they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also a community with thousands and thousands of families—young families. With 88 babies born a week, you can imagine how many young families we have. This coming Monday, the government will make it harder for the most vulnerable families in my community to access early education, and 4,337 families in my community are set to be adversely affected. That's almost one in four families. The complex set of rules that families will need to satisfy to qualify for government assistance will knock thousands of low-income families out of the system and their children out of early education. It will widen the inequity. It will mean some children will be more school ready than others because of the family they were born into, because of the arrangements of that family, because of people's ability to get full-time and permanent work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The activity test that this government will introduce views early education as childminding, and the Liberals seem to think that, if you aren't working in a full-time capacity, your child shouldn't have access to early education. In the federal electorate of Lalor, nearly 10 per cent of people work between one and 15 hours. That's not by choice. That demonstrates a significant shift towards casualised employment. It further demonstrates that this government is seriously out of touch when it comes to its new unfair childcare package and its unfair hurdles, keeping kids out of early education. These economic geniuses have said that they are going to put downward pressure on childcare fees. Well, that's been absolutely blown out of the water this week. You can't reduce funding to give people 12 hours of access and not understand that there's going to be a structural shift in the way the centres do their service provision. There's going to be a cost if people are sending their child for only six hours a day rather than eight hours a day. It impacts on the business structures of those centres and, as a result, they are needing to put their prices up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some other areas of critical importance that impact on young people in my electorate and on families in my electorate. We had many speakers in here today, during our three-minute constituency statements, talking about the impact this government is having on older Australians, but I want to focus on a couple of other things. I want to talk about the digital divide that my community suffers enormously from. I want to talk about the fact that this government doesn't have a plan, in fact has introduced a 'fraudband' and then not made the NBN accountable for their service provision. That has impacted families all over my community. We are tired of the ever-widening digital divide; people in the outer areas and in new areas are waiting up to two years for any kind of internet connection. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to address the conversation that we've been having in this place this week. Those opposite are claiming we are the highest-taxing country in the world. Let's put some facts on the table. Our overall tax take is the lowest in the OECD. Our corporate headline tax may say 30 per cent, but our average corporate payment of tax, the actual rate, is between 17 and 24 per cent. They want to reduce the headline rate to 27 per cent. Most companies in this country are paying no more than 24 per cent. That's the fact that my community needs to understand. They also need to understand that, when it comes to their personal income tax, one per cent of the people in my community earn over $280,000, and they'll get a better deal under Labor.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  I want to use the opportunity of the grievance debate today to acknowledge the lives of four remarkable Australians who we have lost recently. A few weeks ago, Australia lost one of its greatest benefactors, Susan Wakil, a woman whose generosity and philanthropy are overshadowed only by her love for Australia and its people, and her husband of over 60 years, Isaac. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was honoured to meet Susan and Isaac last year after they were appointed Officers of the Order of Australia for their extraordinary charitable efforts. Although not of robust health, Susan was hospitable, attentive and charming. Arriving in Australia from Romania at the age of 15 with her aunt, Susan had already faced and overcome more than most do in a lifetime. Her father had been imprisoned in a Siberian gulag and her mother had passed away from illness. In Australia, the young Susan was heralded by her educators at Sydney's Holy Cross College as a tenacious student whose learning ability and achievements belied her non-English speaking background.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan was a lifelong student of how to live a decent and meaningful life, deliberately seeking out teachings beyond her own Jewish faith to guide her. She was courteous and well mannered, admired by fellow students and educators for her uncanny ability to find pleasure in hard work. Susan saw her match in Isaac, and together the pair formed an exceptional, inseparable partnership that would last a lifetime. They quickly became wildly successful garment manufacturers, thanks to their work ethic and clever minimalist production of clothing staples. Savvy business people, Susan and Isaac reinvested much of their profit into property throughout Sydney's more dilapidated central suburbs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Embodying their core belief that individuals have an obligation to use their opportunities, Susan and Isaac committed their wealth to fostering health, the arts and culture, and developing Australia's future leaders. The scale of their philanthropy reached unprecedented levels following the transformation of their business and property portfolio into the charitable Susan and Isaac Wakil Foundation. They Wakils made the largest ever donation to Sydney University, funding $47 million for the construction of the Susan Wakil Health Building, along with 12 annual nursing scholarships in perpetuity. They also made the largest donation ever to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, with $20 million to construct a new modern art wing. Their support of Opera Australia, Vision Australia's Black and White Committee and the Sydney Jewish Museum has allowed these organisations to thrive in their work and benefit so many Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wanting to empower younger generations with the skills and values necessary to make an effective contribution to society, Susan and Isaac funded a fellowship for passionate student leaders. I'm proud and honoured to support this fellowship and, as an official mentor to one of the future leaders, I'm delighted to have a Susan Wakil fellow, Jeremy Estrin, interning in my parliamentary office. Susan's legacy lives on through the fellowship, as it does through the many other charitable activities that bear Susan's name, and in the hearts and minds of those touched by her generosity. We all enter this world hoping that through our efforts we can leave it a better place. Through Susan's efforts there's no doubt that she achieved this. My thoughts are with Susan's husband Isaac at this time. May her name continue to inspire and her memory be a blessing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was absent during the condolences motions for Sir John Carrick and Jocelyn Newman, and I wanted to take this opportunity to offer some personal reflections on both of them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John Carrick's career in this place and his service to the Liberal Party are well known. He was its, almost, founding general secretary in New South Wales, a Leader of the Government in the Senate and a minister in a range of portfolios during the Fraser government, most particularly in the space of education. Sir John Carrick made an enormous contribution to Australia, to the Liberal Party and to thinking about education policy in this country. But even before he came here, he made an extraordinary contribution as a serviceman in Australia, as so many did. He was originally a serviceman in Sparrow Force. He was then captured and taken prisoner in Changi. He survived the horrors of the Burma Railway, as did my grandfather and one of the heroes opposite, Tom Uren. Both Sir John Carrick and Tom Uren formed a very strong friendship although they were quite ideologically and philosophically different people. They travelled together to Thailand to visit the Burma Railway where they had been servicemen with so many of their colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first met Sir John in the 1990s through our mutual involvement in Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. Sir John was one of a number of former Fraser ministers involved in that organisation who hoped to keep the crown. I saw him regularly at those events, but the first real conversation of any great depth we had was in relation to a book that I was working on, which was the missing biography in the Australian Prime Minister biography set. There is no biography of Sir William McMahon, and I thought it was important to try to rectify that, so I contacted Sir John and asked if I might have an interview with him about Bill McMahon and his leadership. In summer 2007 I went to Sir John's home in Burwood. There he was in a very faded white shirt. It was almost see-through. It was only subsequent to his death that I learnt that he never wore new clothes. He would always buy clothes in second-hand stores, and it was very apparent that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John really wasn't interested in talking about Bill McMahon. In fact, he wasn't really interested in being interviewed at all. Instead, he wanted to speak to me, as the person charged with the responsibility of carrying the party's traditions in my role as executive director of the Menzies Research Centre, about what I was doing to try to build a stronger Liberal Party. In his view, a strong political party meant that we have a strong Australia, because political parties choose parliamentarians to serve in this place, from parliamentarians a cabinet is chosen and the cabinet appoints people to the High Court and to the Reserve Bank. You can't have a strong Australia if you don't have the fundamentals of strong political organisations. He challenged me over six hours in his place—it was a tour de force: what was I doing to make these things better? It was inspiring. He probably would have gone on even longer but for the fact that his wife and daughter returned home and interrupted our conversation, giving me some relief. But I'll never forget that day. Sir John and I maintained a strong correspondence, and we would see each other from time to time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Menzies Research Centre, one of the books that we published was a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety and Choice</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Good Schools for All Australians</span>, a history, effectively, of the state aid debate. John had been active in that debate as a party official. He saw the sectarian divide that existed in Australia as useless. He kept trying to tell Robert Menzies to hop the fence and talk to the nuns: 'You'll find that they are very similar to us.' He had a profound impact on John Howard and the thinking of the Liberal Party more broadly about the importance of the need to provide funding for non-government schools. It was great that, in his early 90s, he came to the Northern Beaches Christian School and launched this book. The twinkle in his eye as he spoke to the young students was absolutely fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My memory of Sir John is warm and long, and I was very saddened by his passing. I was particularly saddened because, when we had the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore, I mentioned him in a speech. I sent a copy of the speech to him and said, 'We must catch up.' We'd exchanged correspondence and tried to find a time to catch up, but it was not to be. I regret that I didn't have a final conversation with John.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second person who we lost who made a real contribution to this place is Jocelyn Newman. Jocelyn Newman came from a political family. Her husband, Kevin, had been the member for Bass, winning the famous Bass by-election, and her son, Campbell, was Lord Mayor of Brisbane and later Premier of Queensland. Both men had served in the Defence Force, and Jocelyn had a deep interest in Defence matters. Indeed, I think Jocelyn was always disappointed that she didn't get to serve as defence minister in the Howard government; although she had been, at various times in the coalition's period in the wilderness, shadow defence minister. I got to know Jocelyn, again, through my work at the Menzies Research Centre, and she helped us launch a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">So Many Firsts: Liberal Women from Enid Lyons to the Turnbull Era</span>. She talked about some of the struggles and the challenges that she'd faced being a woman in the Liberal Party and a woman in parliament. She is rightly remembered for the extraordinary work that she did in relation to welfare reform, particularly the overhaul of the old Commonwealth Employment Service and the establishment of Centrelink and the Job Network, which she created with, among other people, Tony Abbott and David Kemp. I think she was a really special lady. She had a great sense of humour, and, in later years before she got ill, she used to do holidays on container ships, where her company was the crew, and they would cook amazing Filipino food and so on. It was a very practical approach that Jocelyn had to life. It was a very practical approach she had to holidaying as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final person I want to very quickly mention is Stuart Devlin, who hasn't been greatly eulogised in this place. Stuart Devlin passed away recently, and my constituent, Valentino Musico, a playwright and lawyer, remarked that no-one had said much about Stuart. Stuart is the person who designed the coins that came in as part of our decimal currency. Not only did he design the coins in our country but he designed coins in a whole range of countries. His passing should be more noted than it has been.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Stuart's family and to the families of the other people I have mentioned, may their loved one's memory be a blessing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I rise today to share with the House an issue that's of great importance to me and, in doing so, to acknowledge that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport has announced an inquiry last week into biotoxin related illness and chronic inflammatory response syndrome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around one in four people have a genotype that does not allow the body to properly expel biotoxins from concentrated exposure to mould spores from their body. Instead of the body processing the toxins and removing them, for these one in four people, long-term exposure to mould can, in some cases, lead to severe health challenges as these toxins build up in the body, often resulting in a condition known as chronic inflammatory response syndrome, or CIRS. The condition can result in a chaotic and ineffective inflammatory response that creates dysfunction across many bodily systems. Symptoms include nose and throat irritation, fever, cough, headache, nausea, exacerbation of asthma, allergic rhinitis and brain fog. Other symptoms are far worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since sharing my own story last year, having been diagnosed after a tree crashed through my house during a superstorm in April 2015, I've actually heard from hundreds of people from across the nation who have shared with me their own personal struggles and experiences as they have dealt with chronic biotoxin illness or chronic inflammatory response syndrome, as it's more commonly known. I've heard stories like that of Mark McDuffie, who was diagnosed with CIRS after five years of health challenges, including a heart attack, a spinal blockage, paralysis, extreme fatigue, memory and cognition problems and a dysfunctional endocrine system. Mark, an executive at a large organisation, said that his ill health started when he moved into a home that, unbeknown to him, was severely water damaged. He described the experience as his body essentially shutting down and his immune system beginning to attack his own body. Once finally being diagnosed with CIRS caused by this toxic mould poisoning, Mark said he's been able to manage his symptoms with the support of his family and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard from other people, like Judith Medway from West Gosford in my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast. Judith told me it took her about five years to fully recover from her experience with toxic mould exposure after leasing a shopfront with a severe issue with mould. During this time, she suffered extreme fatigue, sinus issues, vertigo and inflammation. Judith told me she thinks that there needs to be more public awareness of the risks of mould exposure but also more public awareness around the issue of correcting the problem. She said that, for her, legislation and regulation to enforce the standards of healthy airspaces and working and residential environments would be a great step forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David and Tanya from Terrigal also shared their story. After buying a property in Terrigal, a two-year-old home, in 2007, they started noticing leaks in the house. They fixed a small leak but in doing so discovered a serious issue with water damage and mould in their home. Tanya tells me that she developed chronic asthma, sinus issues, unexplained body aches and fatigue, and that David developed a chronic cough, allergic rhinitis and unexplained migraines. David and Tanya tell me they believe the issue stemmed from the way in which the property was built, and they suggested building codes should be addressed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hayley McGee from the Southern Highlands in New South Wales wrote to me with her story of her 10-year-old daughter, Mariah, who, after being exposed to mould in her classroom, became severely unwell. Hayley said that Mariah became so unwell she couldn't attend school. She suffered from chronic weight-loss, fatigue, muscle cramps and severe inflammation. At first, like in many of these cases, it was difficult for doctors to diagnose Mariah, but, after finding a specialist based in Queensland, Mariah was diagnosed with CIRS and she has been receiving treatment in Queensland. Her story was told recently by <span style="font-style:italic;">A Current Affair</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard the story of Carly in Melbourne, after she shared her experience with 9news.com.au. When Carly first moved into a new apartment in Melbourne, she was a healthy PE teacher. After moving into the apartment, Carly said she started getting what she thought were severe break-outs and skin irritations, which turned out to be painful skin lesions. Carly began suffering from brain fog, fatigue and memory loss. It wasn't until much later that Carly, with the help of her doctor, discovered that her symptoms would ease when she was away from the apartment. It was Carly's GP who suggested she get her apartment tested for mould. Carly said she then discovered there was a large amount of mould growing in the air-conditioning unit which, when turned on, meant that the mould spores were spread around the apartment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Annalee from the Northern Territory shared her experience with me. She became unwell after moving into a home with visible mould. She told me that of concern to her is the fact that many people don't know about the health impacts of mould. Bronwyn in Hornsby told me of her challenges moving into a rental property after selling a house 18 months ago. She said the rental property has severe black mould in the bedroom and said that her challenge is trying to get the damage repaired. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mould related illness and CIRS GP specialist Dr Sandeep Gupta estimates there are currently a minimum of around 1,580 Australians who have been diagnosed with CIRS. He said that the problem is likely to go a lot further, with a quarter of the population being susceptible, potentially, to this condition. He said that at least 50 per cent of patients with established biotoxin illness can be incapacitated for work or study and could therefore be reliant on government benefits. He further estimated that the cost of this to the government could be close to $20 million a year for those who are currently diagnosed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I'm so glad that the government has taken steps towards addressing this issue, with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport commencing an inquiry into biotoxin related illness in Australia. This was announced by the committee chair, the member for North Sydney. The inquiry will examine the prevalence, geographic distribution, diagnosis and treatment of biotoxin related illness such as CIRS, as well as looking at available research regarding illness stemming from exposure to water damaged buildings. The committee has released the terms of reference on the website, and I am pleased to see this inquiry underway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of this committee I'm really looking forward to hearing from people who may appear before the inquiry and listening to witnesses across the country on this issue over the next few months. My personal view is that this is a very important inquiry for hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians. In fact, since the announcement last week, hundreds of people have contacted my office to say what this means to them. On the Facebook group set up for people suffering with CIRS and mould related illnesses, I've seen countless comments from people across the nation, saying that they finally feel that their voice is being heard. There are more than 3,000 members of the Toxic Mould Support Australia Facebook group. Kate, on this Facebook group, said, 'Fantastic, it needs to be taken seriously.' Beck said, 'Thank you for actually listening.' Tracy said, 'When I saw a GP about toxic mould she had no idea what I was talking about. More awareness is needed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's my view that more awareness into this condition is certainly needed. Once again, I commend the standing committee for their inquiry that will be underway and encourage people who may wish to make submissions to go to the website and to follow the process outlined there. Submissions close on 2 August.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  I'm a proud Western Australian. I've lived there most of my adult life. So I'd like to take this opportunity to remind this government that WA does not stand for 'wait awhile'. I know we're far away and it's easy to miss us on the map of Australia, considering we are only the largest state! But I do find it extraordinary that there are no fewer than six coalition cabinet ministers—six—from Western Australia, including the deputy leader of the Liberal Party. Yet, the Turnbull government has demonstrated a care factor for WA that amounts to a big fat zero—zero, nada, zilch, nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, they care so little for Western Australia that they aren't even running candidates in the Perth and Fremantle by-elections. 'It's too hard,' they say. 'It's too expensive,' they say. 'It's unwinnable,' they say. Well, Western Australians—not just in Perth and Freo—will not forget this. They will not forget that this government was too lazy, too scared and too dismissive of Western Australia that they didn't even think it was worth running candidates in Perth and Fremantle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that I rarely get angry; it's hard to believe but it's true. I rarely get angry, and in this place I do try to retain what little calm and composure I have left in my age, but I am angry about this. Like many Western Australians, I am seriously angry about this. The Prime Minister has actually spent more time in the United States of America than he has in the western state of Australia. I’ll just say that word once again—Australia. That's where we are. I suppose he thinks that we Western Australians should be grateful that he didn't just wave hello to us from 14,000 feet in the air.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the 2016 election campaign, he made just two visits to Western Australia, one of which lasted just 14 hours. He came to my electorate of Cowan just once during that election campaign, when he took the opportunity to stroll through the local shopping centre. He took some happy snaps and some selfies, and then he disappeared into the sunset as he waved, 'Bye bye,' never to be seen again. But that's okay. We won't hold that against him. I won't hold that against him, because Western Australians actually have an alternative. They have an alternative in Bill Shorten and the Labor Party, who actually care about WA.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr ALY:</span>
                  </a>  To prove that, because I hear these interjections, in the last nine months alone, Bill Shorten has visited Western Australia no fewer than six times, as recently as last month. He's been to Perth, Fremantle, Burt, Brand, Pearce, Swan, Stirling, Hasluck, Moore and Cowan. He's been talking to the people of WA in town halls, in the streets, in the shopping centres, at hospitals, at schools, in parks and in train stations—I'm tired just reading this! And he's been talking to them about how a Labor government would deliver for Western Australia—for them. These visits weren't just your fly-by-night drop-ins on his way to more-important business. They weren't. He's done two town hall meetings in Cowan, listening to the people and answering questions, because Bill Shorten cares enough to know that the people of Cowan deserve more than just a selfie and a smile.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last town hall meeting, we had over 350 people attend and raise their concerns about local issues, about national issues and concerns about our GST share. While the government is busy playing catch-up, Labor has already promised to introduce a Fair Share WA Fund that brings GST up to the equivalent of 70c in the dollar. Bill Shorten even took a selfie with a quokka in Western Australia. I believe that that qualifies him as an honorary Western Australian, because you all know that, if you come to WA and you take a selfie with a quokka, that's pretty much like a WA passport! We shall grant him that honorary WA status. More than just the selfie with the quokka, there is a true demonstration of caring for the Western Australian people. He is taking time out of a very busy schedule to come to Western Australia, not just once or twice, and not just for two hours or 14 hours here and there on your way through, because we know that to get to Europe from the eastern states you have to fly over Western Australia; he is actually taking the time to sit down, talk to the people of Western Australia, listen to their concerns, grievances and needs, and deliver on those concerns, grievances and needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just extraordinary that we have six frontbench cabinet ministers from Western Australia. I think that's pretty much a record. But what have they delivered for Western Australia? In parts of my electorate, like the suburb of Greenwood, they can't access the NBN. They're trying to study for school and university and run small businesses from home without any internet connection. What have those ministers done for Western Australia? What have they done in terms of delivering infrastructure for Western Australia? What have they done to ensure that those outer suburbs, like those in my electorate of Cowan, get the infrastructure they need to sustain them into the future as they grow at exponential rates—the roads, the rail, the public transport, the schools that they need to sustain the growth of those outer suburbs around Perth, particularly in the northern suburbs and particularly in my electorate of Cowan?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Western Australians are left playing a game of Where's Wally? with this Prime Minister. He rarely shows up in Western Australia, and when he does he's simply passing through. He has a bit of afternoon tea, takes a few selfies, then he gets on a train and rides off into the sunset, back to the never-never. But with Bill Shorten—</span>

                  </a>  But, with the Leader of the Opposition, Western Australians can see themselves having an alternative leader and an alternative government that actually do care about them, that take the time to come and visit them and listen to them. Having to play Where's Wally? with this Prime Minister means that Western Australians have a very clear choice. They have a very clear choice in the upcoming by-elections, partly because the Liberal Party have refused to run any candidates because they are running scared. Western Australians have a very, very clear choice at the next federal election.</span>

                  </a>  The member opposite keeps interjecting and saying we're not very happy. I will take that interjection because, indeed, Western Australians aren't happy. Western Australians are not happy with the level of representation that they're getting from their six frontbench cabinet ministers as well as other representatives here in this place about their concerns and the things that they need in Western Australia. WA does have a clear choice in these upcoming elections. Their voices will be heard. Their voices will be heard at the next federal election in those polling booths. Either they can vote for an LNP that doesn't even care enough to run candidates in two critical by-elections, that doesn't even care enough to have somebody from that side stand up, or they can vote for a Shorten Labor government—a Labor government that cares, a Labor government that listens and, most importantly, a Labor government that delivers for Western Australia. </span>

So today I'd like to share with the Australian parliament some good news. I've been delighted to secure grants for many organisations in Melbourne through the Stronger Communities Program. I'd like to inform those here about the work that they're doing in my electorate. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community houses and neighbourhood learning centres are the glue that hold together our neighbourhoods and communities. Melbourne is home to many wonderful community houses whose staff and volunteers give their time to run programs, classes and social events, and activities that bring people together. They make a huge contribution to Melbourne, so I was delighted to deliver funding through the Stronger Communities Program for some of these great institutions. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Carlton Neighbourhood Learning Centre was awarded a grant to repair and paint the fence, upgrade a classroom and other works. Thank you to the team there. Belgium Avenue Neighbourhood House manages the underground car park space at the Collingwood public housing estate. To any Melbourne hipsters who are getting sick of laneways, let me tell you: underground parking lots are the future for community theatre and community festivals. Thanks to a stronger communities grant, Belgium Avenue Neighbourhood House will be installing toilets into that magnificent underground space that has already hosted so many amazing events. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">North Melbourne Language and Learning was awarded a grant to build a brand-new covered barbecue area on the North Melbourne estate. This space is up and running and is a great new asset to the North Melbourne community—congratulations to the North Melbourne Language and Learning team. Kensington Neighbourhood House recently used a stronger communities grant that I secured to build a new front deck and ramp that will greatly improve accessibility for people using wheelchairs or pushing prams. Wingate Avenue Community Centre built a new men's shed and completed other works at its Union Road community hub. I'm excited about the new community garden expansion and education materials that will be funded through a grant at Farnham Street Neighbourhood Learning Centre in Flemington. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community childcare centres are also essential assets for our community. They're often under pressure from booming demand and inadequate federal government support. I was delighted to visit the wonderful Richmond Multicultural Children's Centre at Gleadell Street recently, which has received a grant that I secured for a new front fence. Through this program, I have also secured grants for infrastructure and play equipment at Wimble Street Childcare Co-operative in Parkville, Flemington Childcare Co-operative and TRY Australia Showgrounds Children's Centre in Ascot Vale. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Collingwood Toy Library is such an amazing community resource. It's been open for 25 years and lends toys to hundreds of local families. I'm delighted that, thanks to a stronger communities grant, the library has been able to expand its selection to include for the first time toys and board games for six- to 12-year-olds. I had great fun visiting and seeing the new selection and the current toys with my daughter who didn't want to leave. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone has a right to access justice, and it's community legal centres that do the vital work that reduce the barriers to justice that so many in our community still face. So I was very pleased to secure grants for office equipment for Inner Melbourne Community Legal, and Fitzroy Legal Service, as part of their move to new offices. The Aboriginal Family Violence Prevention and Legal Service used a grant for structural works as part of its project to establish a first-of-its-kind Koori Women's Hub in Abbotsford. I've visited the hub, and I congratulate the staff, all the volunteers and the team there for the amazing work they're doing. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am in this place, in large part, because of the importance of tackling climate change and transitioning to renewables. Despite the lack of government leadership at a national level, at the local level communities and community organisations are getting on board with renewables. I'm pleased that, through the Stronger Communities Program, we could secure grants for several organisations in Melbourne so they could install solar panels and implement energy efficiency measures. Grants for solar panels have gone to the 'Wellie,' or Wellington Inc, in Collingwood; the Church of All Nations in Carlton; the Royal Park Tennis Club; and the Abbotsford Convent Foundation. All of these community-run organisations will be able to cut their power bills and cut pollution because of these grants, and that will make them more financially and environmentally sustainable. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cultural arts and music projects have been supported through the Melbourne Stronger Communities Program grants. SEVENTH gallery on Gertrude Street in Fitzroy conducted renovations with stronger communities grant funding. The Chao Feng Chinese Orchestra performs traditional Chinese orchestral music around Melbourne. They've been running for decades as a volunteer organisation with minimal support and doing it on a shoestring, so a grant that has allowed them to purchase new traditional clothes to replace the ageing ones they were using was very welcome. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">3CR is a Melbourne institution. Our airwaves would not be the same without its independent and progressive programming. Before I came to this job, I spent a bit of time there on Saturday mornings co-hosting a legal program myself. I know they do it on a shoestring, so I'm delighted to have secured for them a stronger communities grant for new studio and office equipment. The Boite is a Melbourne institution that has been bringing world music to Melbourne for nearly 40 years. A stronger communities grant has assisted them with communication and office equipment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grants have also gone to organisations doing innovative food and sustainability projects. Food waste and access to fresh food for all are big environmental and social justice issues that local community groups are leading the way to address in Melbourne. North West    Patch is a grassroots community initiative in north and west Melbourne where volunteers are working to create the neighbourhood's very first community garden. This is particularly important in bringing shared garden space to an area where more and more people are living in apartments or higher density units. I secured a grant for planter beds and equipment, and I'm looking forward to watching this initiative flourish. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cultivating Community does great work to support residents in accessing community gardens at public estates and elsewhere around Melbourne. It received a grant for an upgrade to the community kitchen at Fitzroy's Atherton Gardens estate just down the road from my office. The Community Grocer is making a big contribution to our local community. It operates weekly fresh fruit and vegetable markets at public housing estates around Melbourne, including in Carlton, Fitzroy and Flemington. They sell high-quality produce at affordable prices and their popularity each week is testament to this. I have been there and seen the people who line up from the public housing flats to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables, things they would otherwise be unable to afford. The Community Grocer used the grant to secure refrigeration equipment that allows them to run their programs. Lentil as Anything, a Melbourne institution, is much loved and famous for its unique pay-as-you-feel model. Thanks to a grant I secured, it's getting a face lift. I am pleased to have supported, alongside community members, a renovation of their Abbotsford kitchen. The upgrade will allow Lentil as Anything to continue and expand its training for employment programs for refugees, asylum seekers and jobseekers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other organisations, like the Flemington Kensington RSL and Project Respect, have also received grants to renovate their premises. Good Cycles is a fantastic social enterprise that runs not-for-profit bike and training programs. They received a grant for a new training space. This will make a lasting difference. I would like to acknowledge that this was secured through the important work of Matt McCullough, may he rest in peace. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many organisations do great work strengthening our multicultural community and ensuring that everyone belongs in Melbourne. The Eritrean Jeberti community will be setting up a new community office in North Melbourne to support community members. The Albanian Australian Islamic Society has received a grant for a new community library at its mosque in North Carlton. The Australian Muslim Social Services Agency has built a new community classroom, from which it is running education programs in North Melbourne. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Estate Computers received a grant for equipment to ensure that more people at the Carlton public housing estate can access the NBN through wireless connections. U3A Chinese In Yarra, serving older members of the Chinese community, has also bought new equipment for its community room in Fitzroy. The Greek Orthodox Community of Melbourne and Victoria received a grant to install AV technology in its city community centre, and the magnificent Australian Vietnamese Women's Association used the grant funding for a new cultural mural at its Richmond office. Newmarket Phoenix FC has built a new canteen in Flemington. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Grants also went to SisterWorks, the Somali Women's Development Association, the River Nile Learning Centre, the Social Studio, the Melbourne Employment Forum and iEmpower for jobs and education programs that particularly support people from refugee and migrant backgrounds in Melbourne. I'm proud to have secured grants to make our communities stronger in Melbourne.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I know this is a grievance debate. I appreciate the member for Goldstein swapping places with me, enabling me to get my grievance up earlier. I'd like to take the opportunity this morning to talk about the result achieved on Saturday in the Darling Range by-election in the great state of Western Australia by the Liberal Party over the consistency of Labor lies. When I was looking for subjects to speak about in this grievance debate, it was a target-rich environment, so I've got a few issues to talk about today. I'd like to extend my congratulations to member-elect Alyssa Hayden on her win on Saturday night against the anti-WA McGowan government, with a 9.1 per cent swing away from WA Labor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This by-election was a referendum on the McGowan government, and the McGowan government failed. The McGowan government promised before the 2017 election not to raise fees and charges, and once they were elected they increased the bills for hardworking Western Australians by $700 in just 18 months. The first thing they did—part of that $700 increase—was put up retail power prices by 11 per cent, after they'd fought on the basis of not selling Western Power because it would raise power prices. Within two months, they put up power prices by 11 per cent. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been claims by the Premier that this wasn't a judgement of his government; it was a judgement of Barry Urban, the MLA who'd been found not to be truthful about his declarations. To respond to that claim by the Premier, an article in yesterday's <span style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span style="font-style:italic;">est Australian</span> by Paul Murray—a different Paul Murray to the one on Sky—stated:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If Mark McGowan really believes that the Darling Range by-election result was simply a reflection of the Barry Urban affair, <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;&#xD;&#xA;    color:#000000;&#xD;&#xA;  "> then Labor is in way more trouble than people imagine.</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">"Despite the scandal, half the locals seemed oblivious to the by-election, with many uninterested in politics. Some dismissed the lies of Mr Urban as being typical for politicians, while others believed the former MP had resigned because he was a dual citizen."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul Murray has laid it bare in his article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The West Australian</span> and takes away the myth that Mark McGowan has claimed this was nothing to do with him; it was all to do with Barry Urban. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting back to the increases Labor have put in place since they came into government, on top of the $700 increase from last year, they now want WA families to pay another $500 in fees and charges. All the while, Labor rip money out of the WA police budget. Also, those in the Darling Range know all too well about the Labor lies they heard for over 12 months. An MLA who was hand-picked by the Premier lied his way into parliament. At one point he claimed he was the construction manager of a dam—I am sure the member for Mackellar will be interested in this—quite a few years before the dam was even announced. This is the quality of Labor's elected MLA. It doesn't end there, however. During the by-election campaign, WA Labor just couldn't keep their word. The first Labor candidate McGowan hand-picked again was caught lying about her education. I wonder if her degrees had the same fate as the former member's, with the response: 'My mum threw out my degree.' It was just another Labor lie. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken about this before in this place: for 3½ years, as the head of the Labor front the Belmont Community Group, the now member for Belmont had campaigned heavily for a 24/7 police station. I quote from one of her many comments on the issue:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All citizens have the fundamental right to safety and security in their own home and we believe that a 24-hour police station is essential to crime reduction in Belmont.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The now member for Belmont spent three years campaigning for this, and stated it was vital to crime reduction in Belmont, but couldn't even secure the station being opened on the weekend. Stations in Cockburn, Armadale and Ellenbrook are now open for 24 hours, yet there is not a word from the member for Belmont on a 24-hour police station for her own community, which she campaigned for through her community group, which was just a Labor front.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">WA electors know, when Labor promises one thing, to expect exactly the opposite. Sadly the Labor lies are not exclusive to WA Labor but seem to be endemic in Labor at a national level too. It seems that Labor has an addiction to lying about cuts to education, cuts to health and cuts to social services. Under the coalition government, education, health and social services have been supported and fully funded in a real budget—more than those opposite ever have managed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From this government, due to the hard work done by the member for Cook in balancing the books, we now have more funding going into the WA health system and more funding going into WA schools, making them some of the most resourced in the nation. As much as the Leader of the Opposition might want to forget, as education minister he cut $1.2 billion from schools, as states wised up to Labor's secret deals in their flawed education funding model. The coalition government has just got on with fixing up the cuts the Leader of the Opposition made, and we have now introduced real needs based funding, not something that just benefits the member's union backers.</span>

                  </a>  Just yesterday those opposite chose to rip billions out of businesses that have a turnover between $10 million and $50 million, but then had the audacity to claim that they are not antibusiness. Labor think these companies that are in the $10 million to $50 million range are 'the top end of town'. Considering many of the Labor members probably have never had to worry about paying payrolls, they are unlikely to understand turnovers between industries will mean vastly different sizes. And, just because you have a high turnover, it doesn't mean you have a high profit. This is what the Labor people don't understand. When they talk about $50 million companies, they think that is $50 million profit. That is the wisdom of the Labor people who have never run businesses. This will hit 20,000 businesses, employing 1.5 million Australians, with a tax sledgehammer. The fact the Labor Party cannot even bring themselves to guarantee the tax relief already legislated for small businesses with turnovers of up to $10 million tells Australians everything they need to know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are over 100,000 small and medium, often family owned, businesses with turnovers between $2 million and $50 million. Together these businesses employ over three million Australians. The member for Mackellar is here. I've got about 19,000 businesses in my electorate of Swan. I'm sure he has plenty in his electorate, and I'm sure the member for Solomon has plenty of businesses in his electorate. I'm going to enjoy going to enlighten these businesses about the dangers they're going to face and the money they're going to lose because the member for Maribyrnong is going to rip the tax cuts away from them and make them realise that they cannot keep more of the money that they have actually earned. They earned it. It's their money. It doesn't belong to the government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is yet another job-destroying, economy-wrecking higher tax from Labor and confirms yet again the one certainty about Labor—when they run out of money, they will come after yours. The most galling part of Labor's stubborn antibusiness and anti-economy stance is that they used to believe in this stuff. We've heard the Prime Minister relaying all those quotes. They used to believe in it when it was convenient for them, but now all they want to do, as we know, is to harm businesses in Australia, which will harm jobs and harm the economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I do recall in 2012 the then member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, saying that the coalition, upon being elected to government in 2013, would deliver a surplus in their first year and every year thereafter. I would have more luck finding the yowie—in Yowie Park in Kilcoy, actually—than finding a coalition budget surplus, that's for sure. The debt truck has become like a mythical creature. The debt truck is a bit like the yeti, the abominable snowman, or the Loch Ness monster. We are looking for the debt truck everywhere. Where is that debt truck they used to bring out?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first acts of this government—this is why I'm so aggrieved—was to get rid of the debt ceiling, give $9 billion to the Reserve Bank and then deliver debt after debt after debt and deficit after deficit after deficit. Of course, they've doubled the deficit, and the debt has gone through half a trillion dollars. Never ever in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia have we had a government that's so extravagant and so wasteful and that has forced debt and deficit up. That's exactly what's happened. This is all at the same time as they want to give $143 billion away in personal income tax cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a bigger and better and fairer arrangement when it comes to delivering tax cuts for 10 million Australians. Why? Unlike those opposite, I don't have to stand here and say I'm going to give $80 billion to big business and big banks. I've had nearly 200 mobile offices since the last federal election. I'm looking forward to getting to the Rosewood show in the next few days, the last country show of the season. I've been to Ipswich, Kilcoy, Lowood, Toogoolawah, Esk and Marburg, and no-one has come up to me and said, 'Shayne, I reckon you've got to give $17 billion in a tax cut to the big banks. No-one's come up to me and said that at any stage. I've been at the Ipswich show until nine at night, and no-one's done that. The irony of the government is that, at the same time as they're saying they want to put more money—$10 a week, effectively—into the hands of working- and middle-class families, they want to cut $77 a week from Australia's lowest paid workers. That's what they're wanting to do. And, of course, they want to give the Prime Minister a $7,000 tax cut every year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I travel around to places like Karana Downs, the Somerset region and Ipswich, people are telling me that they miss out on taking their kids to sport, to parks and to the movies because they have to work on weekends, and that's why they deserve penalty rates. Labor will support penalty rates. To many people across my electorate, these benefits are really important. They're a positive thing. They make the difference between whether they can pay the rent, pay their mortgage, pay for their kids' school excursions or even pay a power bill. For many of these workers, penalty rates are just the difference. They're not a luxury; they're a necessity. Under Labor, middle-class and working-class Australians will receive bigger tax refunds. In addition, Labor will support penalty rates. We will also support more funding for schools in my electorate of Blair and more funding for hospitals. Under Labor, four out of five taxpayers in Blair will see tax relief almost double that which the coalition government is offering. Over the next four years, working people across Australia, including in my electorate, earning less than $125,000 a year would be $928 a year better off under Labor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government thinks that, as at 1 July 2024, someone on $40,000 a year should be paying the same rate as someone who's on $200,000 a year. That's a very low bar. That's not a progressive income tax system; that's flattening out the income tax system in this country. It's unfair. There will be members opposite who, like me, will find that 78 per cent of hardworking taxpayers in their electorate would be better off under Labor's tax refund for working Australians. In my home state—and your home state, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz—of Queensland, 1.986 million taxpayers will benefit under Labor's plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about Senator Hanson in this area, because originally she came from Ipswich. She joined the Liberal Party and stood for preselection for Oxley back in 1996. She has paraded herself for most of the last 20 years as being someone who has supported battling people in Ipswich and West Moreton. She has supported the coalition 90 per cent of the time in every vote she has cast. One Nation have become a subfaction of the LNP in Queensland. Instinctively they vote with the coalition. They are not for working- and middle-class Australians. They're not for pensioners. They're not for battlers. They won't stand up for Queensland—they want to get a better deal for WA at the expense of Queensland. Senator Hanson has sold out her constituents through a deal with the Turnbull government to sell them a dud deal on income tax plans. Under this government, as I said, debt goes up, but where's the concern for small business, where she came from originally? She proposes a tax plan that allegedly gives $10 a week to working- and middle-class families but provides $80 billion to big businesses, with $17 billion going to the big banks. One Nation have failed people in Ipswich and South-East Queensland. They have simply sold out the values that they claimed that they support. I go and see them as they campaign around my electorate and elsewhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PBO has analysed what the government is proposing to do, and has done, in terms of legislated changes. Certainly stage 3 of the plan—abolishing the 37 per cent tax bracket and increasing the threshold for the 32 per cent tax bracket from $120,000 to $200,000 from 1 July 2024—will overwhelmingly be enjoyed by men. Thirty billion dollars of the $41.6 billion in tax cuts at that stage flows to men. So much for equality of opportunity. There are 59,000 taxpayers in my electorate of Blair who will benefit more under Labor's plans. Only one per cent of people in Blair earn over $180,000 a year, compared to 13 per cent of people in the Prime Minister's electorate of Wentworth. Who is the Prime Minister really looking after? Not the people of Blair. The Grattan Institute analysis has found that, under the Turnbull government's tax cuts, 60 per cent of the annual reductions will go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. That's backed up by NATSEM, the Australia Institute and the ANU's Centre for Social Research and Methods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis after analysis shows that what the coalition government is doing is putting money in the hands of the wealthiest Australians, the biggest banks and the biggest businesses, at the expense of working- and middle-class Australians. Labor proposes to put money in the pockets of 10 million working- and middle-class Australians, and permanently. Every working Australian earning up to $125,000 a year would be better off under Labor than the coalition. And, as I say, 78 per cent of the taxpaying constituents in Blair would be better off under Labor's plan. I'll tell you what they want, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I go round to do my mobile offices at country shows, I hear that they want not to have to complain about the NBN—there is a 204 per cent increase in complaints under the NBN. They want a better NBN, a faster NBN. They want more hospital beds. They want a world-class education system. Instead, what the government's been handing them is a subpar national broadband network. And they're stripping money. Ipswich Hospital and West Moreton Health and Hospital Service are losing $4.61 million under this government, and Ipswich Hospital and the health service have jurisdiction over the Esk Hospital, so the Esk Hospital is losing $80,000 of that $4.61 million. This government is cutting health funding. They claimed that they would match it fifty-fifty. They're not matching it fifty-fifty with the states. Just as they abandoned that commitment to a surplus in their first year of office and every year thereafter, they've abandoned health funding. That's why I'm aggrieved. I'm aggrieved at a government that's failed the taxpayers of my electorate on NBN, health and hospital funding and infrastructure as well. I welcome, as I finish, the $4.75 million in funding that they put in the budget for the Cunningham Highway, but it's five years too late, and I call on the Queensland government to match the funding.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="61378" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I've spoken here previously about the fact that Queenslanders receive the lowest per capita arts funding of all of the states and territories. As I've noted, that's not a recent phenomenon. It's a long-term trend that has existed for many, many years. It's an issue and a challenge that I've been keen to take up, along with my colleagues—the Queensland LNP members and senators, including yourself, Deputy Speaker Buchholz, who've collectively come to be known in recent times as 'Team Queensland'. Without in any way wishing to talk down the fantastic and amazing things currently happening in the arts sector in both Brisbane and Queensland, at the same time, it is really necessary to find opportunities to grow and to continue to support our vibrant arts sector. As I've said before, Brisbane and Queensland have some great things happening in their arts sector. There are hundreds of innovative, creative and vibrant artists who represent our diverse and expanding culture economy, from the four major performing arts companies and independent circus groups to cutting-edge digital offerings and Indigenous arts. The history and culture of arts in Brisbane and right across Queensland are an important part of our identity and our local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year, I provided an update on some recent funding wins that had happened around that time. Today I'm back to report on several additional success stories involving arts organisations in Queensland, including Queensland Ballet, Queensland Performing Arts Centre, the Gallery of Modern Art and QUT. Two weeks ago, I visited Queensland Ballet to make the very, very important announcement that this government has granted Queensland Ballet $3½ million over three years to help them transform the Thomas Dixon Centre that houses Queensland Ballet. That centre is the core. It's the home of Queensland Ballet, and this significant grant is critical to securing and growing Queensland Ballet's future. They are led by Li Cunxin, who is a force of nature and a huge advocate and ambassador for the arts scene in Brisbane and Queensland. Queensland Ballet has directly contributed to the economic and employment growth in Brisbane and around Queensland, and this funding will ensure that they can continue their excellent work. A new 350- to 400-seat theatre will enable both major and smaller independent artists to showcase their work and their talents. The centre will also feature state-of-the-art new technologies so that Queensland Ballet can better collaborate with other Brisbane arts organisations. It's that sort of collaboration which we really want to see and encourage to make sure that there are always exciting new things happening in our arts sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also pleased to announce recently that QPAC, the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, has been granted $420,000 to deliver <span style="font-style:italic;">Armistice</span>, a theatrical performance reflecting on Australia's wartime history. It opens in November this year, and that's a very important time because we'll be commemorating the Centenary of World War I. This performance, <span style="font-style:italic;">Armistice</span>, will explore the sacrifice of wartime and how this experience has contributed to shaping Australia's national identity. This collaborative project will bring our history to life through materials from the Australian War Memorial and the National Film and Sound Archive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased and proud to support this family-friendly and veterans-friendly event which will give the Brisbane community an extra opportunity to celebrate Australia's service men and women and the sacrifices that they've made. Just as an aside, on the topic of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Armistice</span> performance, QPAC has recently told me that they've identified a potential performance venue, called Hangar No. 7, at the old Eagle Farm airport. Hangar No. 7 was used by Allied forces in World War II to defend our shores, and it holds special significance to the people of Brisbane and for our wartime heritage. I'd certainly support exploring ways to try to hold some of their performances there. While the exact venue's yet to be chosen and determined, I'm very confident that this performance will be a great one and that Brisbane residents will join me in supporting <span style="font-style:italic;">Armistice</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another recent win for the Queensland arts industry is the acquisition of a south-west Queensland Indigenous shield. Through the National Cultural Heritage Account, the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art will be assisted to represent a unique element of Queensland's Indigenous history. The gallery told me that it is very excited for this Indigenous shield's arrival, as it's the only known shield of its kind still around, and it offers valuable display and research opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shield travels from Melbourne to its new home in Brisbane, a new exhibition will simultaneously be travelling to rural and regional Queensland. Thanks to a Visions of Australia grant, Museums and Galleries Queensland will tour an exciting sculptural exhibition called <span style="font-style:italic;">Safe Space</span>. Based in Brisbane, as one of the state's peak professional bodies, Museums and Galleries Queensland strives to protect and help prosper the state's cultural future. This travelling exhibition will showcase the work of 12 emerging mid-career and established Australian artists, taking it out to the regions of Queensland that all too often miss out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As that exhibition travels through regional Queensland, the Queensland University of Technology and the Festival of Contemporary Dance, Brisbane will be taking our creative artists to the world. QUT has been awarded $33,000 by the international cultural diplomacy fund, I'm very pleased to say. That grant will enable this leading Brisbane university to promote Brisbane student artists to an international education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also recently seen the inaugural Festival of Contemporary Dance, which received $7,000 from the international cultural diplomacy fund. Through this funding, the festival has used contemporary dance to build a bridge between Queensland's innovative creatives and the rest of the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's some great news there, and all of these really are fantastic pieces of news for Brisbane's and Queensland's arts community. At the same time, my colleagues in Team Queensland and I want to stay focused on the issue of Queensland receiving less than its fair share per capita of funding. The reason that's sometimes given for this entrenched imbalance is that not enough applications are received from Queensland's arts sector—a question of quantity, if not quality allegedly. That may or may not be true and we're certainly very happy to test that. Yet, simply put, this trend, if it continues, risks becoming self-enforcing. It will perpetuate itself if it sends Queensland's artistic talent and the managerial artistic industry talent that hangs off it to other, possibly better-funded states. This unfair cycle has to be broken. It has to end to ensure that Brisbane's and Queensland's thriving and vibrant arts, music and dance industries can continue to grow and evolve and do the very exciting things for which they're famous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to ensure that creatives across Australia, including those in Brisbane and Queensland, can have fair access to funding, I believe they really have to have access to professional mentoring. With this in mind, I'm pleased to report to this chamber that additional investments are now being made in improving mentoring workshops for creative and not-for-profit arts organisations. The mentoring is designed to help provide these Australians, including Queenslanders, with coaching that enables them to develop and be supported as they write more applications and higher quality applications. The aim is that, at the end of the day, young artists, developing artists and independent artists can gain the extra skills and help they need to make more applications and better quality applications to overcome, potentially, this reason that we're being given about not enough applications being made. We want to see equal funding, and we want to see more access to more funding because it means more jobs and more opportunities for our aspiring young, independent and emerging artists. This has a flow-on effect on all of our local economies across Brisbane and Queensland, and it's important, obviously, for the prosperity and vibrancy of Brisbane's arts sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Brisbane's arts sector has to be supported by fair federal funding. There's much more to do, which is why my colleagues and I in 'Team Queensland' will continue to fight for this cause. We know that Queenslanders aren't quitters, but it is hard to continue growing that sector without fair funding. Changing this imbalance will ensure that Queensland's and Brisbane's creatives will have equal opportunities, as will the production teams that will help support their efforts. So I'm pleased to see the positive benefits of our advocacy so far, and we're pleased to see the impacts of that on Queensland's growing arts scene. But this is just the beginning. There is more to do to turn around a long-term funding trend. Through more hard work and support, Queensland will be on track to receive its fair share and to build the thriving arts community that will serve us in years to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249908" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'TOOLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I stand here today to say to the Turnbull government that enough is enough. The Prime Minister stands in this place every day talking about how the Turnbull government is a government of aspiration. I say to the Prime Minister that the people of Herbert have had enough of your empty words because all that my community has to aspire to is this government's endless job cuts. And they've had enough. Unemployment in Townsville has almost doubled under the Abbott-Turnbull governments. Nationally, Townsville has achieved two things under LNP governments: we were the jobless capital; and now we are the insolvency capital. I ask: where is the aspiration in those statistics?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me share some facts that will shed light on the situation. Around 3,000 manufacturing jobs in Townsville have been lost since Labor left office in 2013, and 120 jobs were lost at the Australian tax office in Townsville. Also from Townsville: 50 Defence jobs lost, 40 Royal Australian Air Force jobs lost from 38 Squadron, 19 CSIRO jobs slashed, 30 regional Queensland Customs jobs chopped and an estimated 400 Telstra jobs to go. It's very hard to find any aspiration in those statistics. But this government's slashing, cutting, slicing and dicing of jobs does not stop there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Herbert is a community that is already doing it extremely tough thanks to this top-hat, out-of-touch Turnbull government. The list goes on—$9 million cut from Townsville Hospital and Health Service—more job cuts; $14.8 million cut from Townsville schools—more teaching and admin jobs cut from our schools; $38 million from Central Queensland University—more job cuts; and $36 million from James Cook University—more job cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">James Cook University is also a victim of the LNP government's history of cuts, and, consequently, jobs are being cut right now. James Cook University is axing a number of creative arts courses, and that will include 17 staff jobs at the Townsville campus, 14 at the Cairns campus, and there is an additional job cut that could be at either campus. What do Townsville students think about this? Third-year Bachelor of Creative Arts and Media student Jason Hill is angry as his degree is likely to be on the chopping block. This is what Jason had to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Creative industries is only growing, especially with everything going digital there's a demand in the field and it's constantly evolving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For one of the primary universities in North Queensland to cut their support for something like that could potentially be the death of creative arts in North Queensland</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's sad to hear that the lecturers jobs are at risk, especially in Townsville where the job market is hard enough already</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Jason, I say, 'You are spot on, 100 per cent.' The job market in Townsville is tough, so why is the Turnbull government making it even tougher?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there are the cuts to kindergarten and early learning, which will negatively impact on 2,484 families in Herbert. That's even more job cuts. The Riverview Play Centre in Townsville has also been impacted by the Turnbull government. The Turnbull government is cutting $80,000 to Riverview Play Centre, which means that the centre will be forced to close by December this year. This early learning centre has been running in my community for 26 years and now, under the Turnbull government, it is at serious risk of closing. That will affect 78 families, 110 children and nine staff, whose jobs will be cut, purely because the Turnbull government would rather fund an $80 billion tax cut to big business and the banks than fund access to early learning education for 110 children in Townsville—and that supports jobs in my community as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the cuts to the ABC. Townsville has already lost our local afternoon drive show content, and now this government is planning to make even further cuts to the ABC. That is not to mention the $40.7 million cut to dental and allied health, which means more cuts to health. We have already witnessed significant cuts to health that have affected veterans' access to health services. The question is: what do these cuts to dental and allied health services mean for our veterans? The short answer is: we don't know, and neither does the Turnbull government. That is why I am calling on the Turnbull government to guarantee that this cut will not reduce access for veterans, particularly in light of the repatriation medical fee schedule indexation freeze, which is already impacting on veterans in my community. This government is also responsible for the shocking state of the country's aged-care system. Every single LNP budget has included cuts to aged care. What do these cuts mean? They mean massive job cuts for people in Townsville. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is like the Freddy Krueger of jobs for Townsville. Townsville's citizens would be forgiven for thinking that we are the cast in a horror film. If you are a worker, a pensioner or a veteran you'd better watch out, because the Turnbull government is coming to slash your job. The only way out for this 'Nightmare on Elm Street'—or Nathan Street in the Townsville context—is to vote this top-end-of-town, out-of-touch government out of office at the next election. When workers in Townsville are doing it tough, does the Turnbull government offer a helping hand? No. This out-of-touch government gives Mr Turnbull and people in high-income-earning brackets a $7,000 tax handout. The Turnbull government is focusing on filling the pockets of the top end of town whilst ripping money out of workers' back pockets. Prime Minister Turnbull would rather give himself $7,000 than pass legislation to protect the penalty rates of more than 3,000 workers in my electorate of Herbert. Yet, he still waxes lyrical about being a government of aspiration. The people in my community think that is a joke. There is nothing in the budget for Townsville. Ripping money out of the pockets of 3,000 workers, on top of the last 13,000 workers that he robbed of penalty rates, is not going down very well in my community. To add insult to injury, the Prime Minister is giving another $80 billion to big business and the banks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor does have a fairer budget and a fairer future plan for Townsville. Labor understands Townsville, and only Labor will deliver for Townsville. Labor will help workers, families, pensioners and veterans. We won't be giving big business and the banks an $80 billion tax handout, because we have our priorities straight. We understand that workers actually need something to aspire to. Labor has committed to funding $100 million for Townsville's long-term water security, alleviating the pumping costs for the local council. Labor has committed to funding $200 million towards hydro power on the Burdekin Falls Dam, which will alleviate Townsville's energy costs. Labor has committed to funding $75 million to the port expansion project. That will ensure that our fuel does not sail by to Brisbane, only to be trucked back to Townsville. Labor will fund our universities, we will fund TAFE and we will fund schools, ensuring that education and training are a priority and not a second thought. We will fund the Townsville Hospital and Health Service, ensuring that residents get the best possible local healthcare services. This is critical for the Townsville Hospital and Health Service as it is the only tertiary health service in Queensland outside of the south-east corner. Labor will protect penalty rates because we believe that workers deserve to get a monetary reward when working on weekends and public holidays and missing out on time with their families. We will back small businesses, families, pensioners and veterans, because Labor is the party of a fair go for all citizens, not just the few.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  When prominent citizens of our region pass away, it's important that their achievements and contributions are recorded. I wish to take the opportunity to do this today. Bruce Bolam passed away unexpectedly at the age of 77 earlier in the term of this parliament. It is fitting that his contribution to Australia and the city of Bathurst appears in our nation's <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. Bruce was a towering figure in Bathurst and central western New South Wales. He was a well-known businessman, former mayor of Bathurst, philanthropist and family man. He was born in Far North Queensland in 1939. Bruce, his wife, Rose, and their three young children, Megan, Melissa and Andrew, came to Bathurst in 1974 for a holiday and never left. They spent their first winter living in the old caravan park before Bruce went on to become one of the region's most successful business people. He was a true entrepreneur who was not afraid to take risks. Through his many business ventures he built wealth, prosperity and opportunity, not to mention employment for many, many country people. Over the course of his career Bruce ran several successful businesses, including a security business that expanded from one branch to 30 and became the largest privately owned security business in the country. He also owned and operated the motel and caravan park on the highway at the entrance to Bathurst. In fact, the iconic gold-panner that still greets visitors as they enter the city today was his idea. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of his successful career he helped, through many acts of kindness, a huge number of people who were in difficulty. The public never knew about them. His love of Bathurst saw him actively and successfully engage in public service through his role as mayor, an office he held for four years. While he only spent four years as mayor of Bathurst, in the 1980s, he never stopped striving to see Bathurst grow and develop. He later moved into property development. His developments literally changed the streetscape of Bathurst for the better. I spoke to Bruce and his business partner, Dave Pennells, about how proud they were that their developments were not only modernising the streetscape but also maintaining the heritage value of Bathurst. It's a legacy that will last for decades. His creativity was also evident in his love of gardening, which culminated in the grand championship of the Australia-wide national garden awards in 2001 for his home, Blair Athol. In 2014 Bruce was fittingly awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for services to the Bathurst community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although I didn't know Bruce for long, I greatly enjoyed his company, and I highly valued his views on local and national politics. He had a keen sense of humour and was a real gentleman. I was proud to count him as a friend. He is greatly and deeply missed by his wife, Rose, and his children Megan, Melissa and Andrew. He is greatly missed in Bathurst as well. However, his vision lives on. Construction on his projects continues to this day. At his funeral, Bruce was described as a dedicated and true Bathurstian. He was. He was a true friend to many, a true visionary and a great regional Australian. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cecil Hayes was a self-made man. He was the son of a blacksmith. He was an only child, born in Manildra on 22 May 1930. His father, also Cecil, was a blacksmith and his mother, Annie, was a school teacher. As a child Cec made his way around Manildra in his father's next-most-impressive creation, a magnificent wooden billycart finished with leather trim. The billycart was pulled around town by his pet goat, which young Cec trained himself. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cec learned much from his blacksmith father. He was able to fix anything and he was always tinkering, making things or making things better. His formal education ended at the end of sixth class, when he was told by a nun that he would amount to nothing. How wrong she proved to be! Covering his 21st birthday, the local Manildra magazine described Cec as the most conscientious worker and a boy of upright principles who was a credit to his parents and popular with all walks of life in community. After leaving school, Cecil started out as an apprentice motor mechanic at Snell's Garage in Manildra. He inherited his lifelong love of trucks from his uncle Bill Boles, and at 19 purchased his first truck, which was a 1937 International D35. Just a month later, Cec was carting wheat to the silos in Manildra when the cab caught fire. He was always calm and pragmatic. He recovered the truck and managed to finish the job. He continued truck driving until the end of the harvest, when he rebuilt it from scratch. That truck stayed on the road, and it was the start of Cec Hayes Transport. He was as proud of it at the end of his life as he was on the first day the company began. At its height, Cec Hayes Transport, his family business, operated 10 B-doubles and expanded into fuel distribution as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was 28 when he married Shirley in March 1959. Their first son, Michael, was born by the end of the year, and, in quick succession, they went on to have three more sons—Johnny, Barney and Paul. Though he himself was an only child, Cec was an inspiration to his sons. He enjoyed their respect and seldom had to raise his voice. He raised his sons to look out for each other, work together and enjoy each other's company, and they did. Cec was tough but he never complained. He was a true gentleman.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the early 1980s, Shirley and Cec moved from Manildra to Orange. The house in Namatjira Crescent was a place where children, grandchildren, friends and neighbours would all drop in for a cup of tea or a beer to spend time with their Pa. When they moved to Orange, Cec established his trucking business in Leewood, and one by one his sons joined him full time in the business. Even though he was the boss, it didn't stop his love of being on the open road. He loved trucks and the trucking community, and he had great respect for everyone. He made some great mates and was universally admired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cec Hayes was the first to receive life membership of the Livestock and Bulk and Rural Carriers Association, its highest honour. Around 1990, after hundreds and thousands of kilometres on the road, Cec handed over the reins of his transport business and turned to his next love—farming and horses, in particular trotting horses. One of his trotters, Owner Operator, won two races at Harold Park, to his great delight. As a local member, I would often—and still do—attend harness racing meetings around the region. I would invariably see Cec at these meetings, and we would always get together with the program and have a flutter. We'd have a punt, and I would take Cec's tips on all of these races. Some days we had more luck than others, but I certainly enjoyed his company at those country race meetings, as did everyone else. He had a true love of harness racing. Many people on those country race tracks enjoyed Cec's company and enjoyed having him at the track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it was on the farm that Cec really enjoyed himself. He loved being outdoors, fixing things, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren loved spending time with him out in the paddocks. For those who knew him, Cec was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather and mate. He could walk into a pub and have a drink and start up a conversation with anyone in the room. He was a true quiet achiever. He was humble and modest and measured in his thinking. He was calm and he was a kind man. He was a real country gentleman. I know that he's greatly missed by his family and friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You could see the depth of his community involvement by the number of people who attended his funeral. I was one of the attendees on that day. Afterwards, many of us gathered at Duntryleague Golf Club in Orange, where we swapped stories about Cec. There was a wonderful display of photographs at Duntryleague which recorded the various stages of Cec's life. He had a very rich and full life, and I think it's a life to which we should all aspire. He was, as I said, universally admired. He came from humble beginnings yet enjoyed great success. He was supremely modest and an inspiration to so many people. It's a privilege to be able to honour him in this Chamber this afternoon.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I rise to speak about something that I've heard about every day for the last five years. Every single question time I've been in since the coalition came to office, I've had either the member for Cook or the member for Dickson take a question from the backbench and talk about asylum seekers and borders, and many of the answers to the dorothy dixers given to the former immigration minister and the current immigration minister have involved politicising the fact that people sometimes seek a better place, a safer place in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to offer a few words to counter that daily tirade from the member for Dickson. A few weeks ago, I went on a delegation with the member for Mallee; Tim Watts; and Luke Hartsuyker—I've forgotten their electorates. The delegation was led by the member for Mallee, Mr Broad. It was a small delegation to Kenya and Ethiopia. We mainly went to Nairobi and Addis Ababa, but in the first part of the delegation we travelled north to Kakuma, a refugee camp with 189,000 refugees, in the northern part of Kenya not far from the South Sudan border. That makes it a  large city—twice the size of Toowoomba, shall we say, for people that are familiar with that town. All of these people had fled war, murder and hardship and were seeking a safe haven.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation, ably led by the member for Mallee, consisted of two members of the National Party and two members of the Labor Party. The member for Gellibrand, Tim Watts, and I have inner-city seats where many asylum seekers have been settled over the years. Most of the asylum seekers in Gellibrand and Moreton—or in Australia, I guess—have arrived in those electorates by jet and have been part of our longstanding commitment as an Australian government to taking people from the hellholes of the earth. We're a wealthy country. We're a secure country. We're an island country. To be able to take asylum seekers from a hellhole is something Australia should do, and we do our fair bit. I just wanted to do that callout to those many asylum seekers who are often demonised in this parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  As you may be well aware, I have a longstanding and abiding commitment to freedom of speech in a free society. I believe in the freedom of all Australians to be able to stand up and express their views without recourse or repercussions. Of course, freedom of speech is a complex issue. There are a lot of people around who like to talk about their freedom of speech but seem uninterested in the freedom of speech of others. The reality is that, like all freedoms, it sits within a context. Freedom is critically important, but it is enlivened by a framework of laws, policy and a culture, I might add, around what people can say in the freedom of a society; but you need to have a preservation of the institutions within that society and, of course, also protect it from external threats. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was, in my former capacity, serving as Australia's Human Rights Commissioner, the primacy that I put on those foundational freedoms was clear by the fact that I wasn't given just the formal title of Australia's Human Rights Commissioner but also dubbed by the then Attorney-General, the Hon. George Brandis QC, now high commissioner, as the 'Freedom Commissioner'. Tragically, or may I say blissfully, some people on the other side of this chamber like to occasionally taunt me with titles like 'Freedom Boy', which I take as a badge of honour, because, in the end, if you're not prepared to stand up for basic freedoms, I really don't know what the point of you being in this place is. But that is not the principal purpose of what I want to discuss tonight. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The concern I have is twofold. Recently I was in the United Kingdom, in France and in Ireland on a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegation. Each of those countries, in their own subtle way—whether it was through the challenges of elections, whether it was Brexit, whether it was their own presidential election or whether it was domestic ordinary elections for parliament—is facing a concern over the increasing foreign interference of some foreign agents in wanting to engage in influencing democratic processes through the production of false or misleading so-called news reports which are then spread and promoted through social media. Of course, there are allegations against a number of countries, principally Russia, which has sought to publish and produce content which is false, based on lies or misinformation designed specifically to target domestic populations to turn them against their own citizens, as part of almost a divide-and-conquer strategy of foreign policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Countries like the UK, like Ireland and like France are dealing with the realities of this, because of course it creates problems in domestic elections. It creates increasing problems, because when you have so much information that is available, as it is today—and we are certainly living in a time where information is more readily available than in human history—and the credibility of that information is not able to be easily tested, you have a problem. These countries are now seeking to see what it is that they can do to offset the influence of foreign actors trying to influence their domestic elections. It's not an attempt to silence or shut down legitimate points of view or differences of opinion against political rivals; but what happens when people deliberately insert into your domestic political debate falsehoods like, 'Donald Trump was endorsed by the Pope'? That is clearly false. Well, we don't know what his private view is, but he certainly didn't publicly endorse Donald Trump. Of course, using that example demonstrates a challenge faced by the United States as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How is it that you can design legislation and laws? They're principally seeking to do so through a process of transparency at the moment, by trying to impose an obligation where source information's origin is disclosed so that people can make their own judgements of credibility. So, if there is content about domestic elections and it comes from a source in Russia, or certainly a Russian server, unsurprisingly, you can then make an assessment that perhaps that might have some degree of influence from a foreign agent, just because it isn't coming under the banner of RT or Russia Today, but also subversive blog sites and the like. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a critical challenge here. This is one that may be befalling other countries, but we may have it in good order as well. There is a clear tension between some of the issues around freedom of speech and democratic participation, as well as dealing with fundamental issues of national security. If we're not ahead of this and seen to learn from the activities of other nations, then we will only be waiting until there's a time in the future where other countries seek to take advantage of our charity, our generosity and our freedom to subvert not just the democratic process but, ultimately, the authority and strength of the state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I put that in the context that I have other concerns. In fact, in this chamber, a colleague who, by pure coincidence, happens to be in the chamber with me, the member for Canning, recently raised concerns around an individual by the name of Chau Chak Wing and his involvement in various activities related to our domestic concern. I am not going to get involved in the issues around that case. I know it is presently before the courts. In my opinion, it would be irresponsible for me to say anything about that at the immediate time. However, I do have concerns when people who are accused of what are, frankly, serious issues are able to haul media outlets who seek to report some of this conduct into court under defamation law. Don't misunderstand me. I believe in defamation law, and I believe in people's right to defend their reputation. But I do think we're entering a new phase, where allegations—whether they are of bribery or foreign interference in our electoral process, which is something the legislation now going through the parliament is seeking to address, or foreign interference that may be seeking to do more nefarious things—cannot be called out by the media, without fear or favour, because of threats of defamation suits, the practice of defamation law. For people seeking to protect themselves, the standard and the test in law for those who are making the allegations may be so high that they may not be able to defend themselves, particularly on the basis of truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the two examples I have outlined, there is clearly a challenge for our country in dealing with the tensions between preserving the institutions of our democracy—the preservation of the state which we've signed up to support by being elected to this parliament and standing in this place—and the need to preserve freedom of speech. I am not going to jump to conclusions about how we are best able to accommodate these issues and address our laws in dealing with them. In regard to both examples, we do, in part, need to look at the experiences overseas, but I do think we're coming up to a critical moment where we should be prompting an inquiry. This parliament, whether that be in the House or the Senate, should move for an inquiry by a joint standing committee, at the request of the Attorney-General or by some other mechanism, to understand the practical reality of what our current laws mean for freedom of speech in dealing with foreign actors and foreign agents, particularly those who may wish our nation ill or may be engaged in conduct which is contrary to the preservation of the state and/or our national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sort of action that this parliament could take that could be constructive, proactive and do a lot to protect the interests of this nation, so a recognition of defamation law and some tensions around national interests is critical. Part of that is that members should be able to stand up and raise concerns in this parliament under parliamentary privilege, and we should acknowledge that that's part of it. But, in addition to that, we should recognise that we must not have an environment where foreign agents and foreign actors can seek to use false or inaccurate information designed to divide citizens and turn them against each other in electoral processes, as has occurred in other countries, and that, in working with social media companies and the like, there is a necessity to see how we can build not just the legal infrastructure but the social infrastructure and work with commercial enterprises to protect this great nation, because the cost of sitting around and waiting for an attack, as it were, in the future is too high. Our democracy and the institutions that underpin it are very strong, but they are also, at times, vulnerable to the influence and the attitude of others who want to undermine them, and I would rather not see that occur. I would rather see those of us who stood for election to serve in this parliament and serve their country take a proactive approach in defending this nation's interests. I think the opportunity is ripe to take that action.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  I rise today to speak about the Prime Minister's budget. Budget after budget, we've seen the Prime Minister and his friends from the top end of town tell us that big businesses getting more will benefit working Australians. We've seen the lowest wage growth in the history of this nation. We've seen cuts to hospitals and schools, an increase in the age for eligibility for the pension and the abolition of the energy supplement payment for pensioners. What this budget represents is a government that will find any excuse to sneak services away from the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many residents contact my office about the services that they receive. Many residents make me aware of a whole range of issues that they experience—for example, pension applications with ballooning waiting times and a shift away from being able to speak to someone in Centrelink and from being able to get assistance with your application from people who know the system. Instead, they move them on and tell them that they have to do it through the internet, on their computer. This is fine if you're computer literate, but a 75- or 85- or 95-year-old person who doesn't have the skills that a lot of the generation after mine have grown up with, who perhaps feels very uncomfortable with computers and who has no idea how to even turn on a computer still needs assistance. They need face-to-face interaction with these services and agencies to ensure that they get their payments correct or to correct mistakes that may have been made by them or by Centrelink. It is so cruel. The age pensioners who come to my office say that they are frustrated with waiting times when they call Centrelink and that they can't get through. They get put onto a robocall that tells them to press certain buttons or to go on a computer and apply online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These people have a tradition of face-to-face interaction with other people. They've done it all their lives, continuously, from childhood and their working lives right through to pension age. They speak to people; that's the way they deal with things. And now they go into Centrelink and are fobbed off. It's not the staff's fault; it's the cuts that have taken place and the automation that's taking place. I think there should be a special exemption for people who are not computer literate so they are able to go in and talk to someone about their issues and have their problems solved. That's just one example of the cuts taking place across the Public Service that are actually hurting people and making them feel the cuts in a real way—in the delays to having their problems solved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had many constituents come in to see me, so I know that the current Centrelink system is flawed in this manner. People are already falling through the cracks. But the budget that was released recently didn't want to address these flaws. It simply wanted to move the goalposts, with new announcements of more cuts to the Public Service sector. We need a budget that's going to support these people, not diminish their services and make them lesser services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, increasing the age pension doesn't assist older people either, especially if you're doing back-breaking work—working in a factory or as a bricklayer or carpenter. The increase does nothing when you're asked to work until you're 70, and it does nothing to support many hardworking Australians who have worked all their lives and who are simply trying to get by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also astounds me that the government continues to operate on the belief that an $80 billion handout to big business and banks is the way to go, but supporting pensioners and those on low incomes isn't. I know that we on this side of the house will never give an $80 billion handout to banks and big business. The difference in priorities between the government and the opposition is clear. The priority of the government is the top end of town, and our priority is 10 million working Australians and delivering fairer working conditions and fairer cuts to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can't seem to find $17 billion in the budget for schools to fund the future of Australia, so they've cut it. But we'll deliver needs based funding and restore that $17 billion to those schools. In hospitals, the national waiting time for elective surgery is the longest on record. And what does the government do? It cuts $2.8 billion. We on this side of the chamber are committed to investing the $2.8 billion in more beds, shorter surgery waiting times and upgrading emergency departments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has a dreadful Medicare record, and that record does not stop with this budget. The government wants to continue the freeze on Medicare rebates, leaving everyday Australians to foot the bill when they visit a GP. We want more investment in better health—20 MRI machines—and better education, and we want to ensure that Australian working men and women are better off through the tax breaks that we are talking about, compared to an $80 billion tax cut for the big end of town.</span>
