As minister representing the Attorney-General, I wish to advise the Senate of the government's position in relation to Senate motion No. 733. This is an order for the production of documents requesting the tabling of the KPMG report into the funding of the federal courts and the Ernst &amp; Young costings in response to the KPMG report. You'd be aware that I have now tabled a response in relation to this motion whereby the Attorney-General has claimed public interest immunity over these documents. That is set out in detail in the response provided by the Attorney-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can advise the Senate in summary, however, that public interest immunity has been claimed on the following basis by the Attorney-General. The reports have been and will continue to be relied on in future government decision-making processes on court structure, administration and financial arrangements, and their continued utility relies on them being treated with a degree of confidentiality. Input and advice to these reports from stakeholders, especially the federal courts, was provided on the basis of assurances that information provided, including sensitive and specific staffing information, would be treated confidentially. Disclosure of the reports would be expected to limit the extent to which stakeholders, in particular the federal courts, would engage fully future reports of this kind even if given assurances of confidentiality over information provided. This would result in future reports not being fully informed by full and frank advice and the government would not receive the most comprehensive advice from its portfolio departments and agencies. For these reasons, the Attorney-General has claimed public interest immunity over the documents requested and I refer honourable senators to the Attorney-General's correspondence to the Senate President as tabled.</span>

                    </a>  That must be a new one! In relation to this position, we have a government that is, I think, clearly making a mockery of democracy and making a mockery of this chamber. They are refusing to be held accountable, and Minister Cash is a minister who has used public interest immunity more than any other minister I have seen in the decade that I've been in this place. This is a minister who, in a previous portfolio, has presided over an absolute disgrace of an administration—a minister who comes in here and is always prepared to use question time to attack union officials without any evidence, attack the trade union movement without any evidence and smear and use innuendo about ordinary Australians looking after working people day after day, doing the hard yards against the Business Council of Australia, who are trying to get tax cuts at the expense of working people. That's where this minister owes her allegiance. That's where this minister goes. This is a minister who turned a blind eye to the illegality of her former commissioner for the Australian Building and Construction Commission, Nigel Hadgkiss—a commissioner who ended up in disgrace, a commissioner who used $400,000 of public money, authorised by Minister Cash, to defend an illegality. </span>

She has got absolutely no credibility in doing the right thing as a minister in this government. She misled the Prime Minister when she appointed Nigel Hadgkiss because she should have told the Prime Minister that Nigel Hadgkiss had breached the legislation that he was supposed to uphold. This is a minister with no credibility—absolutely none. If she were to do the right thing, she would resign from the frontbench and deal with the issues that she is facing. But all she is prepared to do, and all this government is prepared to do, is spend more and more public money to defend the indefensible. She is an absolute disgrace as a minister, and all the posturing, all the nonsense—</span>

                    </a>  Thanks for that, Madam Deputy President. I don't think anything could be more relevant. What could be more relevant than a minister coming in here, once again, claiming public interest immunity on behalf of another minister? I think it's appropriate for me to point out that the minister who is in here representing the other minister is one of the greatest abusers of public interest immunity in this place. This is a minister who misled the Prime Minister, as I said, and re-appointed Nigel Hadgkiss when she knew that Nigel Hadgkiss had breached the law. All she had to do was look at what this public servant was doing and she would have understood that he had no case to defend the indefensible that he had participated in. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a minister who uses her political power to interfere in other government instrumentalities—the ABCC, the Registered Organisations Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman. This is a minister who has got a web of advisers—former advisers, former mates, former Liberal cronies—in these so-called independent organisations to attack the trade union movement, to attack working people. This minister has misused her power as a minister. I've said it before: I watched a BBC <span style="font-style:italic;">Panorama</span> program about the interference by Putin against his political opponents in Russia. I tell you, he could learn a lot from Minister Cash. He could learn a lot from this minister. To use your political power to misrepresent positions in this place, to use your political power to ensconce your mates in individual instrumentalities and then to use them to attack the trade union movement and working people in this country is an absolute disgrace. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The abuse of power by Minister Cash is, I think, just outrageous. This is a minister who, in my view, instigated the leak of the AFP raid. That's why she is so determined to use public interest immunity in this place. Is it feasible? It beggars belief that a senior person in Minister Cash's office tips off the media about the raid by the AFP that was instigated by Minister Cash using the Registered Organisations Commission, her creation, to attack the AWU. We know what it was all about. It was about attacking the Leader of the Opposition. It's a complete misuse of political power in this place. This minister misled parliament on five occasions. Then she had to come in and throw her staff under the bus, sacrifice her own staff, to save her own political skin. That's what this minister did. Everyone knows that that could not have happened without this minister knowing what was going on. </span>

You may as well just join the Liberal Party. This is where Senator Hanson came from. She came from the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party knew that they had some credibility and kicked her out because of her outrageous, racist views. They kicked her out, and now we've got the Liberal Party cuddling up to her. And we'll get Senator Hanson cuddling up to the Liberal Party. It's absolutely outrageous! What an obnoxious position this member takes every day in this place. </span>

That's our job. All they do is hide behind public interest immunity and get their puppets to stand up and try to deflect when they're under pressure. Well, Senator Hanson, it's no use being a puppet in here; you actually should stand up for something other than racism and attacking people in this country. It's just absolutely outrageous.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has got a terrible record on funding for courts and essential services. Not only did it ignore the call in the KPMG report for an emergency injection of $5 million in funding, but the Abbott government cut $30 million in funding from the Family Court in the first year. This is a government that cut funding for the Family Court and increased funding for the ABCC. It increased funding for Nigel Hadgkiss and his cronies in the ABCC to attack working people in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, Minister Cash, who is in here defending the government's position this morning, is the worst of them all in the coalition: misleading this parliament on five occasions, a ministerial office in chaos and revolving doors in her office. People are moving out of her office as soon as they come under any scrutiny. As soon as they come under any scrutiny, off they go to get a job working for the Hotels Association, assisted by the minister or by the government in Western Australia. All the links are there. We know how this mob works: if you're in trouble, throw your adviser under the bus. Off he goes to get a job with the Hotels Association, and then you try to hide from the misbehaviour that you've carried out. The web of influence that this minister has created in so-called independent organisations is a disgrace. It's a disgrace for democracy and it's a disgrace for the coalition—an absolute disgrace. Minister Cash comes in here and she attacks refugees, attacks working people and uses question time to simply make assertions that are not true. Then, when she is in trouble, she wants to hide behind public interest immunity to avoid scrutiny, failing to comply with orders to produce answers to the estimates questions. She just treats the Senate with absolute disdain.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just Senator Cash that treats the Senate with disdain; the coalition treats the Senate with disdain. I'd have thought any Independent worth their salt, who wants to make sure a government is held to account, wouldn't be in here defending the government, wouldn't be in here defending Senator Cash, as Senator Hanson has done on every occasion she got the opportunity to this morning. What an absolute disgrace for One Nation to be in here trying to defend Senator Cash, trying to defend this rabble of a government. Pauline Hanson's One Nation should just actually sign up to the coalition—because you're just part of the coalition. You're just part of the coalition.</span>

She just didn't ever go there. It was always an attack on the unions, using independent bodies to attack the union movement: put her mates, put her allies, put her plants into independent organisations and then use them to attack the trade union movement and use them to attack the Leader of the Opposition. That's what this was all about.</span>

Well, nobody else in the world seems to think he's great.

                    </a>  This is a minister, in Minister Cash, who failed to act on employers ripping off workers. We have Senator Hanson in here defending a minister who fails to defend workers getting ripped off. What is this about? We know what it's about. Senator Hanson is nothing more than a right-wing Liberal. That's what she is. She's a right-wing Liberal. I don't often say this, but at least John Howard had the courage and conviction to throw her out of the party for her disgraceful conduct. Now we've got other former prime ministers like Tony Abbott cuddling up to her. What a disgrace this party is. The coalition have just lost the plot—absolutely lost the plot.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Cash comes in here and defends wage theft, does nothing about workers getting their superannuation ripped off and does nothing about apprentices getting ripped off. There have been two reports from the Fair Work Ombudsman about apprentices getting ripped off—not a word said. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet what we get from Senator Hanson is a dirty deal with the coalition to give massive wage cuts to the Business Council of Australia in return for a thousand apprentices. I've never heard Senator Hanson mention apprentices in this place since she's been here. I've never heard Senator Hanson or any One Nation member come to an estimates committee and ask about the welfare of apprentices. They've never cared about apprentices, yet, when it suits them, they'll do a dirty deal with the government to try and cover up their capitulation to the government, to hand over $65 billion to big business.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to Senator Cash: Senator Cash should have a good look at herself. She is a minister who has misled this place on five occasions, thrown her staff under the bus to protect her own position and refused to deal with the issues for working people in this country when she was the minister for industrial relations. She has refused to act honourably in her position in this place. She is an absolute disgrace. She should resign. She should talk to the Federal Police, tell the Federal Police exactly what happened and save the Federal Police the investigation that they are undertaking, save the public money and do the right thing. Senator Cash should resign. She can hide behind public interest immunity all she likes, but she will be found out, because her position is untenable. She is a disgrace of a minister. She has misled this place at least five times. She should just fess up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's actually the first time that I have noticed that Senator Hanson was one of the co-signatories to this motion, so I'm a little surprised that she is one of the people running interference to protect her Liberal mate Senator Cash this morning. I would have thought that, if Senator Hanson were so interested to get these documents—which I'll go into in a moment—she would actually want to see it through and would want to put some pressure on the government to produce the documents that she sought. But of course that would involve going against her Liberal mates, and in particular her best mate, Senator Cash, so she has backed down on her own request to produce documents.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose that we're not really that surprised to see Senator Hanson backing down when it comes to taking on the Liberals. It's always a lot easier for her to just vote with them, as she does—it's got to be more than 85 per cent of the time. Are you keeping a running total, Senator Hanson? It's got to be getting towards 90 per cent now.</span>

                    </a>  Okay. The subject matter of this particular notice to produce concerns something that Senator Hanson has been very vocal about, along with a number of other senators, and that is the funding crisis that we see in the family courts in Australia and the backlog in family law cases that that funding crisis is producing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor did not move this motion seeking the production of documents—so no accusation can be made that this is some sort of partisan exercise from the opposition; it was moved by a number of crossbench senators—we share the concerns of a number of crossbench senators about the funding crisis that is enveloping the family courts and the backlogs that that funding crisis is causing for many Australians who want to see their family law disputes resolved. This order to produce simply sought the production of documents that the government has in its possession.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not long after they were elected, under the then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, the government commissioned a review into the funding of the federal courts and the family courts. They are sitting on a March 2014 report from KPMG, a report into the funding of federal courts, and they're also sitting on some costings that were prepared by Ernst &amp; Young in response to that report from KPMG.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion that was moved last week and passed by the Senate was an entirely reasonable motion that sought to get access to these documents so that the Senate can better understand the rationale behind this government's continued refusal to properly fund the family courts. I think we can understand why the government is so keen to keep these reports secret, because, under this government, the Federal Circuit Court, which handles many family law matters, and also the Family Court have been driven to crisis. This government has now been sitting on this report for four years. You would really think that it would want to get that report out there in the public domain to help explain its own decisions about funding the family courts, but instead, four years later, we are still trying to obtain access to this report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the government sitting on this report four years on? It's pretty obvious that it's because it must reveal that there is a $75 million shortfall in court funding which this government has refused to fix. Fortunately, we are now rid of the former Attorney-General, the man who I think we're now to refer to as Mr Brandis. Fortunately, we're now rid of him.</span>

                    </a>  It probably is my most courteous description of former senator, His Excellency, His Worship, His Grace, Mr Brandis. And I say hello to Mr Brandis out there if he's watching us on TV, as I'm sure that he is. Fortunately, we are rid of Mr Brandis from this chamber, the man who deprived the family courts of fair funding, the funding that was required by Australians to have their family disputes settled. I would have thought that now is an opportune time for the government to finally come forward and table these reports that they continue to sit on. But, no, the secrecy goes on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government, employees of the Family Court—it's not just about providing funding to employ more judges and to employ more registrars to keep up with the delays and get through the backlog of cases—continue to be deprived of a fair pay rise. Employees in the Family Court have not had a pay rise for four years. How is that fair? But I suppose we can't be surprised that this government is depriving its own workforce of pay rises when we know that the policies that it has for all workers in Australia are to keep wages low while it provides big company tax cuts to its mates at the big end of town. Judicial positions have been left vacant for a number of months, and this, as I say, has been contributing to case backlogs. Families who are going through extremely difficult circumstances through relationship breakdowns are kept waiting years to get a hearing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no question that this government should properly fund the family courts. It should put the resources that are required into the courts to make sure that families going through relationship breakdowns are able to resolve their disputes, whether they be about property, contact with children or any other matters. But this government refuses to provide that funding, and now it refuses to provide a report that it received four years ago that presumably recommends an increase to funding to fix these problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently participated in a Senate inquiry which clearly was only required as a result of this government's funding shortfalls. Because of the fact that everyone knows the Family Court is overloaded and people are having to wait far too long to have their matters heard, the government has commissioned a review of the family law system, something that Labor supports, but, in the meantime, before the review has been handed down, the government has come up with the notion of parenting management hearings as a way of trying to cut through this backlog. These parenting management hearings are the subject of some legislation that is currently before the Senate and that a Senate committee has recently, just this week, handed down a report on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that Labor senators lodged a dissenting report in that inquiry, because we don't believe that the parenting management hearings are the way that family disputes should be dealt with, especially while a much broader review of the family law system is being undertaken. The only reason the government have put forward the parenting management hearings as an alternative to the Family Court is that they're not prepared to put the money into the Family Court to properly resolve disputes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key problems with parenting management hearings, in the view of Labor senators, is that litigants and family members going through breakdowns are not able to be represented by legal representatives and there is a very clear problem if you have a relationship where there's a power imbalance. Typically, it would be a woman in a less powerful situation than her former partner or spouse. Very often, matters that go before the Family Court involve, unfortunately, circumstances of domestic violence. Labor believes that it is important that people in those situations have access to legal representation to ensure that their position can be fairly and adequately put. Unfortunately, these parenting management hearings do not provide for legal representation. They're basically a way of trying to resolve family disputes on the cheap. The better way to go would be for the government to provide the funding that is required to make sure that the Family Court can get through its backlog of cases rather than having to create a new structure, while it's in the middle of a review, to try to overcome the backlog it has created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested that, during Senator Cameron's speech in this debate, we saw Senator Hanson repeatedly jump to the defence of Senator Cash. It was notable that—with the exception of Senator Payne, who, I think, once jumped up during Senator Cameron's contribution—no other government senator jumped to Senator Cash's defence, but the person she could rely on over and over again in that speech was Senator Hanson. As we know, Senator Hanson has now got a very long-term deal underway with the government, the Liberals, her own former party. But I was very surprised, as I say, that it was Senator Hanson who kept jumping up, because not only was she one of the signatories to this motion requiring Senator Cash to produce these documents—and, as I say, you would have thought she would have had an interest in actually receiving them—but one of the issues Senator Hanson has been quite vocal on since she was elected is problems with the Family Court that stem from underfunding. So I would have thought that, quite apart from the fact that Senator Hanson was one of the co-signatories to this motion, if she were actually serious about wanting to fix the problems of underfunding in the Family Court, as she says she is, she would actually want to get some answers from Senator Cash. But no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know—whether it be on this issue, on penalty rates, on cuts to pensions or on company tax cuts—that what Senator Hanson says when she's outside this chamber and out touring regional Queensland or anywhere else that she goes is very different to what she actually does when she comes to Canberra and votes in the chamber. On penalty rates, she has twice voted with the government to support penalty rate cuts going through and hurting poorer workers in our community. She has repeatedly voted with the government to cut pensions, she has repeatedly voted with the government to cut apprenticeships, and she has even voted with the government to make it easier for construction companies to bring in temporary overseas workers, something that she says that she's against. This is just another example today of something we repeatedly see from Senator Hanson, where she says that she's in favour of one thing when she's out there courting votes, particularly in regional Queensland, but every single time she comes into this chamber she not only votes with her former party, the Liberal Party, but stands up and tries to protect Senator Cash from facing legitimate questions about Senator Cash's own behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these days Senator Hanson is going to realise that she's been caught out. It's one of the reasons that she wasn't successful in the Queensland election and managed only one seat when she and James Ashby were out there claiming at one point that they were going to hold the balance of power, and then they were going to hold 12 seats and then they were going to hold 10 seats. It actually ended up being one, and that's because people in regional Queensland have worked out that Senator Hanson doesn't tell the truth and doesn't back up her words with her actions when she comes down to Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having dealt with the Family Court matters that are the subject of this motion, I want to turn to what we are seeing in Senator Cash refusing to comply with this order. It is a continuation of a pattern of behaviour, in particular from Senator Cash but also from other ministers in this government. As Senator Cameron said this morning—Senator Cameron has been here a lot longer than me—he can't remember seeing a government that has so frequently used claims of public interest immunity in order to avoid answering questions and producing documents that are the legitimate subject of questions from this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cash is the prime culprit when it comes to this. We all know, and I think everyone in Australia knows, that Senator Cash is in a huge amount of trouble over her office's involvement, potentially her involvement and potentially other ministers' involvement in the scandal around the police raid on union offices that occurred late last year. We know that that is still the subject of an investigation by the Federal Police. What we saw—and what we continue to see—from Senator Cash about that police raid was her continued use of public interest immunity and other mechanisms to avoid answering any questions about her involvement, her office's involvement or the involvement of other ministerial offices in that scandal. It's not going to work. We know that the truth is going to come out, and already the truth is starting to leak out. I have no doubt that, at the end of that police investigation, we will have the full truth, so all that Senator Cash is doing in refusing to answer questions is delaying the inevitable and, frankly, pushing that scandal closer to an election, whenever that might be. I would've thought the government would have wanted to get this as far away from an election as possible, but, in fact, by delaying, all they're doing is making sure that it remains fresh in people's minds, whenever that election might be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw from Senator Cash during Senate estimates in October last year, when this scandal first broke, was that she used public interest immunity in order to avoid answering questions of senators at Senate estimates. Very conveniently, as soon as the scandal broke, she organised for her friends at the Registered Organisations Commission who had launched this raid to write to the Federal Police and essentially ask whether it was going to be okay to answer questions now that a police investigation was underway, and, dutifully—I'm not impugning the Federal Police—as expected, the Federal Police wrote back and said that these matters would not be the subject of comment by the Federal Police. Of course, Senator Cash and the man now known as Mr Brandis got together and worked out that the best way to avoid these questions was for Senator Cash to say that a police investigation was underway and that she was now not able to comment on the police investigation or any matters connected to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who bothered to read the email that the Federal Police supplied in response to the Registered Organisations Commission and in response to the Senate estimates committee would have noted that what the Federal Police were saying was that they couldn't comment on the investigation. There was nothing in there that said that Senator Cash and other ministers couldn't comment on it. But, of course, we had the man now known as Mr Brandis doing his usual tricks of interpreting words in ways that suit his ends. I'm a lawyer; I've seen people do that, and Mr Brandis, to give him credit, is an expert at exaggerating words to suit his own legal arguments. What they came up with was that Senator Cash was now not able to answer questions about the matters that were under investigation by the Federal Police.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was shocked to see Senator Cash turn to this as a way of avoiding questions, because what it basically said was that she thought it was better to be under investigation from the Federal Police than it was to answer questions in a Senate estimates committee. I would have thought that any minister would want to be transparent in answering questions, if they had nothing to hide. The last thing you want to do in politics is say that you're under investigation by the police, but Senator Cash chose to argue that she and her office were under investigation by the Federal Police and that that meant that they couldn't answer questions. What a way to look guilty! If you want to look guilty in the eyes of the public, say that you're under investigation by the Federal Police. That's the route Senator Cash chose and continues to take to this day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We tried to ask questions about it again in estimates recently, at the end of February, and, again, the response was, 'We'd love to tell you what went on there, but the police are still investigating us.' If Senator Cash wants to keep going down the route of arguing to the Australian public that she can't talk about something because the police are investigating her, let her go ahead. Our case is basically proven.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues that we're still trying to get to the bottom of is other ministerial offices and their involvement in the scandal. We've had the very interesting and Brandisesque, if I might call them that, answers from the now Minister for Human Services, Mr Keenan. Mr Keenan was the Minister for Justice at the time of this raid. He was the minister overseeing the Federal Police. He has been very careful in the answers that he has given in the House of Representatives to questions about the involvement of his office in this. What he has said up until now is that no member of his office was involved in the leak of the information. What he means by that is that no current member of his office was involved in that. Everyone knows that, just like Senator Cash, Minister Keenan has had resignations from his office—people who no longer even work in the government—and he has been very careful to say that no former member of his office was involved in that leak. It won't take us long to work out—there has already been reporting on this—that it was not only Minister Cash's office who were involved in this leak but also Minister Keenan's office, and maybe other ministers' offices as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As long as Senator Cash and other ministers claim to use public interest immunity as a way of avoiding questions about their involvement in this scandal, these questions won't stop. We will keep asking them and we will get to the bottom of it. Minister Cash might decide to use the fact that she and her office are under police investigation as a way of avoiding answering these questions, but it won't work. There is going to come a time when that police investigation is concluded. I have no doubt that it is going to find that this scandal went a lot further than just one member of Senator Cash's office. It is going to find, without doubt, that other ministers' offices were involved and that questions about Senator Cash's own involvement will continue. Senator Cash should stop using public interest immunity to avoid answering questions about the Family Court or her office's involvement in this scandal. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="76760" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  How can it be that the entirety of these documents is damaging to the public interest? <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> already has a copy of the KPMG report. Excerpts and summaries of the report have been published in the paper. Consequently, they are already in the public domain, and the government's ability to support the court does not appear to have been undermined by that publication. The minister representing the Attorney-General's response shows a complete disregard for families navigating their way through the family law system—a system that, in the words of the former Chief Justice of the Family Court, Diana Bryant, is 'letting the people down'. The former Chief Justice went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The whole system suffers from a lack of resources to get through the work in a satisfactory way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those statements were made in 2017, and now, in 2018, very little, if anything, has changed. Only last week, in a ceremonial listing for senior Family Court Judge, Justice Thackray, His Honour said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I've been burning to say these things for years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His final address to the profession was a searing indictment of this government's continued failure to provide the court with the funding it needs to do its job properly. His Honour called out the government for taking years to replace retiring judges and added his voice to the deafening chorus of calls for an urgent injection of funds to deal with the growing case load and inordinate delays. So we have a senior judge and the former Chief Justice publicly voicing their long-held and very real concerns about the parlous state of the Family Court's funding. How is it then that this government can continue to ignore the repeated calls for funding? How is it that this government thinks that all will be fixed with piecemeal and tokenistic gestures? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take the extra funding allocated to the court for registrars announced in the 2017 budget: three registrars across three courts and seven states and territory—only three registrars for all three courts. That hasn't even scratched the surface. In the words of former Chief Justice Diana Bryant, matters continue to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… just sit in the list. That's appalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are not my words. Those are the words of the former and highly respected Chief Justice of the Family Court, who, in October 2017, called the delays 'appalling'. Barely six months ago, the then Chief Justice of the Family Court was pleading for more funding for a system that is overworked and underresourced—but I don't want to reduce this debate to balance sheets and budgets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just pause here for a moment and actually think about what is at stake. Let's think about the children and the parents who spend years having their most intimate details laid bare for social scientists, lawyers and judges to dissect and determine. We're not talking about large multinationals crossing swords over abstract contractual principles. These are desperate families dealing with a breakdown in the family unit and all the emotional, financial and logistical complications that flow from that. Delays in the system due to the lack of sufficient resources can only serve to further inflame the conflict. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Family law disputes are necessarily the consequence of failed hopes, dreams and plans for a shared life. The legal profession and the judiciary, including the former Chief Justice, have all identified the government's failure to replace judges quickly—or, indeed, at all—as a significant factor in the current delays. Let's take Adelaide, my home capital city, as an example. Following the retirement of Justice Dawe, South Australian families have been waiting for over 12 months for a replacement judge. So there is now only one judge available to decide the state's most complex matters—one judge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Attorney-General confirmed that there was a full complement of judges in the court for the first time in years. How do you then explain to the people of South Australia what one judge will actually do when there used to be two? How do you explain to the people of South Australia that they will have to wait twice as long to get before a judge? Or does the government simply expect the one remaining judge in Adelaide to work twice as hard? Remember, these are complex cases often involving intractable parenting disputes, including allegations of serious physical, sexual and psychological harm or complex property settlements where mum is barely scraping by on welfare payments and child support while she waits for the property settlement to be determined by the next available judge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government needs to acknowledge the failure to replace judges quickly and that the continued failure to replace Justice Dawe has had a snowball effect on separating families. I know this because I've heard too many stories of South Australian families suffering financially and emotionally while they wait and wait and wait on the list. It is not uncommon for matters to spend two years on the Federal Circuit Court waiting for their trial only to be kicked upstairs to the Family Court where they must start once more at the bottom of a very long queue. This is occurring because of the limitations of the FCC and the complexity of certain matters. With only one judge now sitting in the Family Court in Adelaide, matters are taking well over three years to determine. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the various state and territory law societies and the Law Council of Australia that these stories are not unique to Adelaide. For example, in the Sydney and Parramatta courts, families can wait over three years to get to the final hearing. And what is so frustrating is that we absolutely know that this is not a new problem because, unlike the Senate, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> actually managed to get a copy of the 2014 KPMG report. What was reported paints a sobering picture of the nation's three federal courts. In an article published on 29 August 2014, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> reported an expected $75 million budget as a consequence of the court's structures and complex and increasing caseload. The article said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 127-page report, which was handed to the government in March, reveals court costs are rising faster than the money set aside to pay for them, and not enough potential savings remain to cover the shortfall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"The current challenge now lies in that the pool of potential 'efficiencies' has already been tapped and that it does not appear possible to continue to produce them at the same pace ... without a significant restructure or decline in service levels …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That report was completed four years ago, and there is no indication that the service levels have improved in the meantime. Remember, this is not a customer satisfaction survey for a retail chain. The court is providing a service to separating families. That service is to hear and determine their matter in a fair, efficient and cost-efficient manner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our attention then turns to the term 'restructure'. We know the government amalgamated the administrative functions of all three federal courts in order to claw back costs, but what other changes is the government planning? We know from Senate estimates that the Attorney-General has met with the courts to discuss reform. Are the proposed parenting management hearings just the first part of a broader reform that was proposed back in 2014, or is this a quick-fix idea, a last-ditch attempt by the government to salvage a broken system after years of repeatedly ignoring pleas for funding? Remember that these calls for funding are not the disgruntled murmurings of the few; sustained calls for more funding have come from the judiciary, the legal profession, legal aid centres, academics and social workers. And they are based on the limited information available to us from KPMG. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first attempt that has been made to seek a copy of the report. We heard during the recent Senate estimates that there was, at that time, an FOI request pending, and, during question time in November 2016, Senator Hanson requested a copy of the report. In response, the then Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, made two points that I'd like to highlight. The first was that the department had relied on these documents to achieve useful efficiencies, and the second was that he would consult with the secretary of his department to see what he could make available. So, here we are, 18 months later, and we must now all surely be questioning what impact, if any, the so-called useful efficiencies have had on the current logjam in the courts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that is the point: we simply do not know. We don't have the full picture, and the government does not want us to know. So, how can we be expected to consider the Family Law Amendment (Parenting Management Hearings) Bill in a vacuum, when the government has sold this bill to the Senate as a new justice model, promising swift and cost-effective dispute resolution for all? And it is for all, notwithstanding Senator Brandis's response to my question in December 2017: these parenting management hearings will in fact be used in cases of family violence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposal is a significant departure from existing family court procedures. It is an untested social experiment being thrust upon unsuspecting participants that is binding on them and their children. These are people who will have to deal with the consequences for many years to come. It may be a pilot program for the government, but make no mistake: for the estimated 500 families and the 1,000 children affected, it will be permanent. It also comes at a significant cost of over $12 million—just for a pilot program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked the former Attorney-General, George Brandis, about the timing of the reforms in December 2017, and yet again I find myself asking: why is the government choosing to legislate now, before the Australian Law Reform Commission has completed the long-awaited review into the family law system? If the government were serious about the review and about helping vulnerable Australians through one of the worst periods of their lives, it would wait for the recommendations of the ALRC before thrusting yet another layer of complexity on an already overburdened system, especially when we know that, as part of its terms of references, the ALRC will be looking at 'the appropriate, early and cost-effective resolution of all family law disputes' and 'the pressures, including, in particular, financial pressures, on courts exercising family law jurisdiction'. I would expect that, as part of that investigation into financial pressures facing the courts, the government will ensure that the KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young reports are provided to the ALRC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has available to it two presumably comprehensive reports which set out the financial pressures the Family Court is facing, and presumably the range of possible options that were available to the government at the time. The time has now come for the government to produce the reports: first, to the Senate, to enable a proper consideration of the merits of the parenting management hearings bill, and, second, to the ALRC, to better enable the commission to consider the financial pressures facing the family law system pursuant to its terms of reference.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  I've had a quick look at the minister's response to the OPD and I will express a preliminarily view. But, before I express that view, I want to make it clear that there is no constitutional impediment to this chamber making an inquiry into the administration of the courts. We must of course respect the need to steer clear of matters related to legal proceedings, but the issue of appropriate resourcing for the courts is fairly and squarely within the purview of this chamber. The letter tabled seems to make a claim that does not fit within the accepted public interest immunity claims—and I refer the Senate to pages 662 and 667 of <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span>—but it does fall within the grounds that are not accepted by the Senate, again on pages 667 and 669. I will look at this letter, consider it and come back to the chamber in due course, but I do want to state that it is for the Senate to accept or not accept a public interest immunity. If it does not accept it then it can use its powers to enforce the order. This may become a test for both the government and the Senate in this instance.</span>

Part of that fundamental democratic principle is respecting the right of the people to have access to information that underpins government decision making. This government uses public interest immunity claims almost reflexively to deny not only this chamber and members of the Senate but the Australian people the capacity to hold them to account and to more fully understand information on which the government's decisions are made. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the immigration portfolio around what the government describes as 'on-water matters'. The government also regularly uses public interest immunity claims to draw a veil of secrecy over the horrors of what is happening to people on Manus Island and Nauru who remain in Australia's duty of care.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had a quick look at the letter provided to the Senate today by Minister Cash. The Greens, on face value, do not accept the claim of public interest immunity made in that letter. It is quite clearly outside the grounds laid out in <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span>, as Senator Patrick has stated, and in fact—again, as Senator Patrick has stated—falls clearly within the grounds that ought not, under precedents set by this chamber in the past and advice from the Clerk to this chamber in the past, be accepted by this chamber. We stand ready to work with this Senate to ensure that the information that the government is continually trying to keep secret is made public, and we do that on behalf of our democracy, on behalf of the people who put us into this place with their votes and on behalf of the supremacy of the parliament over the executive government. We will work across party lines to ensure that claims like this are tested and to ensure that, where the Senate does not accept claims of public interest immunity, further action is taken on behalf of the right of the Australian people to have the capacity to more fully understand decisions the government makes.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  I am pleased to speak briefly in relation to this bill, the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018. As senators are aware, the bill follows the <span style="font-style:italic;">2017</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Independent intelligence review</span> that was commissioned by the government to examine the roles of the Office of National Assessments, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Signals Directorate, the Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation. The review further examined the relationship and engagement between those agencies and other members of the broader national intelligence community, including the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review made a number of recommendations, including that the Australian Signals Directorate, ASD, become a statutory authority within the Defence portfolio, that ASD's priority role of supporting the Australian Defence Force capabilities be clearly reaffirmed, that ASD's legislative mandate be amended to explicitly recognise its national responsibilities for cybersecurity, including the provision of advice to the private sector, and that ASD take formal responsibility for the Australian Cyber Security Centre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill broadly serves to implement these recommendations. It will establish ASD as an independent statutory authority within the Defence portfolio, reporting directly to the Minister for Defence. ASD will continue to play a vital role in supporting both the ADF capabilities and the national intelligence collection requirements. ASD's functions will be expanded to include the Australian Cyber Security Centre and allow the ACSC to cooperate with persons and bodies listed in the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and, significantly, to advise and assist businesses and the community directly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also enable the transfer of the Computer Emergency Response Team and its functions relating to cyber policy and security from the Attorney-General's Department to ASD. Significantly, the bill establishes new functions for the ASD, including to prevent and disrupt, by electronic or similar means, cybercrimes by people or organisations outside of Australia and to protect the specialised technologies and capabilities acquired in the performance of its other functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has been examined by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, which has recommended that the bill be passed. I and my NXT colleague Senator Griff are pleased to support the bill as a necessary and desirable measure to strengthen a vital national intelligence collection agency. However, dealing as it does with amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001, this bill also provides an opportunity for me to foreshadow a major issue that we intend to pursue when the Senate debates further elements of the government's latest tranche of national security reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken previously about the importance of a well-resourced and capable intelligence community to protect Australia's national interests and the importance of improving parliamentary oversight. As those agencies are given more resources, more power and more responsibility the mechanisms of oversight should be similarly reinforced. In a speech to the Senate last December I highlighted the need for parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence community to extend beyond questions of administration and finance to matters of policy, effectiveness and, as necessary from time to time, operational matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is currently severely limited in the scope of its oversight role, which is largely limited to questions of administration and finance, as I've suggested. Specifically, the committee is prohibited from reviewing intelligence-gathering and assessment priorities of the Australian intelligence community. It is barred from examining sources of information, other operational assistance, operational methods or any operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by the Australian intelligence community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PJCIS may not review the content of or conclusions reached in assessments or reports made by the Defence Intelligence Organisation or the Office of National Assessments, nor may it review the coordination and evaluation activities undertaken by the ONA. The committee is prohibited from reviewing particular operations or investigations that have been or are proposed to be undertaken by the Australian Federal Police. Significantly, the PJCIS is also prohibited from reviewing the privacy rules made by the minister under section 15 of the Intelligence Services Act, which are the written rules regulating the communication and retention by agencies of intelligence information concerning Australian persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These limitations of the extent of parliamentary oversight are very extensive and reflect an underlying bureaucratic mindset that MPs and senators, elected representatives of the people, cannot be trusted with our nation's most sensitive national security information. This is not the approach taken in other countries, including Australia's intelligence partners. In the United States, high-powered congressional committees have the authority to reach far into operational matters. Those inquiries are accepted by the US intelligence community as necessary and appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No doubt there are details of intelligence operations, especially human intelligence operations, involving sensitive and vulnerable sources that are best held by the smallest number of people with an absolute need to know. There may well be cases for a ministerial veto on the PJCIS's access to some specific operational information. As I pointed out to the Senate in December, in Canada, the new National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians is able to review any activity carried out by a department or intelligence agency that relates to national security or intelligence unless that activity is an ongoing operation and the appropriate minister determines that the review would be injurious to national security. If the appropriate Canadian minister determines that a review would be injurious to national security, he or she must inform the committee of his or her determination and the reasons for it. If the appropriate minister determines that the review would no longer be injurious to national security, or if the appropriate minister is informed that the activity is no longer ongoing, he or she must inform the committee that the review may be conducted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Canadian parliamentary intelligence oversight arrangements have considerable merit. They have been adopted by a so-called Five Eyes partner with an intelligence community and parliamentary system very similar to our own. The Canadian approach could provide an enhanced framework for the PJCIS's oversight of our intelligence agencies, with the added provision that any ministerial veto over review of an operational matter should be referred to the IJIS for review and a report to both the PJCIS and the Prime Minister. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions, then something is wrong with the relationship between the intelligence community and the parliament that it ultimately means to serve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate will in due course debate further legislation to give effect to the government's further responses to the intelligence review's recommendations and to strengthen our laws to protect Australia against espionage and covert foreign interference. The government will be seeking the support of the opposition and the crossbenchers. That legislation should be subject to rigorous scrutiny and debate by the Senate. NXT will consider that legislation on its merits, but we will push hard for operational oversight of the intelligence services by the parliament because the time for such scrutiny is both necessary and long overdue. We will take the opportunity to press for amendments to the Intelligence Services Act to provide for an expanded PJCIS oversight of all intelligence activities including operational matters. If the government want to increase the powers and the responsibilities of our intelligence agencies, which, again, I and my colleagues broadly support, then they must be prepared to strengthen the role of the parliament in overseeing those agencies to ensure they are truly defenders of our national interest and, indeed, the Australian people.</span>

That review recommended that ASD be established as an independent statutory agency within the Defence portfolio reporting directly to the Minister for Defence. This was endorsed by government.

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… ASD will be better placed if it remains in the Defence portfolio but if it is in a position to operate with greater independence from the Department’s requirements, especially those in relation to its capacity to recruit, retain, train, develop and remunerate its specialist staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For ASD, the option of continuing to operate within the Department of Defence’s employment framework, even with some specific exemptions, is not the most effective way forward. It would increase the risk of losing additional critical talent, skills and capabilities. ASD needs to be more in control of its own destiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting those comments, it is also important that I make this point: the bill does not seek to alter the indispensable relationship that ASD has with the Department of Defence and, in particular, with the Australian Defence Force. Underpinning the closeness and the enduring nature of the relationship between ASD and the ADF—and consistent with recommendation 6(c) of the intelligence review—the agency now has for the first time a principal deputy director, who will become the principal deputy director-general with the passage of this bill, position that is filled by a three-star military officer. The creation of this position will ensure that, after 1 July 2018, ASD's primary support to the ADF continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does not alter the primacy of ASD's foreign signals intelligence responsibilities as well as the use of its offensive cyberwar fighting capabilities and cybersecurity expertise in its critical support of military operations. Through the implementation of the recommendations of the intelligence review, ASD's functions to provide this support to military operations remain unchanged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the employment of staff, ASD will operate outside the Public Service Act framework. This will provide ASD with greater flexibility to recognise the skills of its specialised workforce and to retain those with highly sought after skills, such as those with science, technology, engineering and maths qualifications in particular. While operating outside the Public Service Act framework, ASD will adopt the principles of the Public Service Act with regard to its employees to the extent that the Director-General of ASD considers they are consistent with the effective performance of the functions of the directorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to briefly touch on a matter raised by the committee with regard to providing greater clarity to staff around employment conditions. I can assure the Senate and the staff of ASD that workplace agreements and staff entitlements, including mobility rights and maternity leave benefits, will not be adversely affected by the establishment of ASD as a statutory agency. In particular, the incoming Director-General of ASD will work with the Australian Public Service Commissioner to make sure that the redeployment register continues to be available to excess ASD employees. To ensure that employees will retain access to maternity leave entitlements, the government and ASD are working towards amending the regulations in the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973, with ASD actively working towards the necessary changes occurring before it becomes an independent statutory agency on 1 July.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes an additional function for ASD to protect the specialised technologies and capabilities acquired in the performance of its other functions. ASD can't perform its important functions without being able to protect its tools to ensure their ongoing utility, which ultimately helps to protect Australia's national interests. The bill also makes a number of transitional provisions to ensure that the good governance of ASD continues during the implementation of the new arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the bill also strengthens the oversight and transparency arrangements for ASD. As an independent statutory agency, ASD will have new corporate reporting obligations, in particular through meeting the requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. In turn, ASD will have its own component of the Defence portfolio budget statements, and officers will attend Senate estimates hearings not as part of the Department of Defence but as a separate statutory entity. ASD will be required to publicly report on its performance through the release of an annual report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is a critically important element of Australia's oversight arrangements for the intelligence community to ensure that all relevant agencies are operating legally and with propriety. Through the implementation of recommendation 22 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent intelligence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">review</span>, the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will have its resourcing significantly increased to ensure that it can continue its important work as the scale and complexity of the operations of agencies like ASD increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of ASD as a statutory authority puts the agency on a similar footing to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation as a national security and intelligence asset. Given the critical operational support that ASD provides to the Australian Defence Force, and its increased national responsibilities in relation to cybersecurity, ASD will now have the appropriate statutory functions to ensure it is well placed to support ADF operations as well as its responsibilities for combatting cybercrime, including the provision of advice to the private sector into the future. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The risk of espionage, sabotage and coercive influence in Australia's domestic liquid fuel refinement part of the supply chain has been assessed as relatively low, due to the sector's diversity and the resilience of the market system to respond to any disruption at a particular location. However, the sector is heavily reliant on imports, and critical port infrastructure. The infrastructure at ports that support imports of liquid fuel was a key factor in determining which ports are captured by the Bill. The critical ports captured by the Bill provide 92% of total liquid fuels imports.</span>

Consistent with its commitment to national security, Labor supports the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 and the Security of Critical Infrastructure (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support these bills because we recognise the need to manage national security risks arising from the possibility of malicious foreign involvement in our critical infrastructure. Labor believe that these bills strike an appropriate balance. They impose only the necessary and relatively minor regulatory requirements needed to improve the management of the national security risks that threats to our critical infrastructure pose. The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill provides a risk based regulatory framework to manage national security risks from foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure. The bill focuses primarily on the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion in Australia's highest risk, critical infrastructure sectors of electricity, gas, ports and water.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor recognises that foreign involvement in the economy, and in Australian infrastructure, plays an important and beneficial role in supporting economic growth, creating employment opportunities, improving consumer choice and promoting healthy competition while increasing Australia's competitiveness in global markets. However, with increased privatisation, outsourcing and offshoring of supply chain arrangements, and the shift in Australia's international investment profile, critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion. This bill is an appropriate step to inhibit malicious conduct undertaken covertly which may have implications for Australian society.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always ensure that critical infrastructure assets, where they are partly owned by foreign entities, are still subject to control and direction by the Commonwealth. It is fundamental to the maintenance of the security, safety and prosperity of Australians that critical assets are required to provide relevant information to government and that, in times of emergency, they can be directed to ensure that the needs of Australian society are met. This was a sentiment shared by state and territory governments and industry and peak organisations who expressed support for the bill in submissions to the PJCIS.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is self-evident that gas in Australia is an important energy source. It is an increasing export commodity and a required element for a wide range of industrial, commercial and residential uses. Gas is particularly important for gas-powered electricity generators, which account for 20 per cent of Australia's electricity, and manufacturing, which relies on gas for approximately 40 per cent of net energy. These are numbers that, as Australia transitions to a clean energy economy, we expect to grow. Accordingly, the protection of gas infrastructure as a critical asset will grow, not diminish, over time. By defining the level of criticality, the bill limits the regulatory burden to Australia's highest risk critical assets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will supplement the existing FIRB mechanism through which the Commonwealth can respond to risks. However, because the FIRB mechanism applies to foreign investment above certain thresholds at the time of the proposed transaction, it is not possible to use it as a mechanism to address risks in outsourcing or offshoring of assets owned by domestic entities or where sales fall outside of the FIRB's screening thresholds. Accordingly, the creation of the security of critical infrastructure framework will improve upon existing safeguards which protect critical assets.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In practice, the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill will add to the work currently undertaken by the Critical Infrastructure Centre, which collaborates with asset owners, asset operators and state and territory regulators to identify risks, implement asset-specific mitigation strategies and develop sector-wide best-practice guidelines. The CIC engages with asset owners and operators through the Trusted Information Sharing Network, TISN, and directly as needed. This is a welcome addition to the regulatory architecture that protects and maintains assets critical to Australia's security and continuing economic and social wellbeing.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PJCIS conducted an inquiry into this bill. We spoke to a range of stakeholders and other interested parties. The committee made nine recommendations, the majority of which relate to the implementation of the bill rather than its design or intentions. I note that in the government's response to the committee's report, which was tabled just now, the government has accepted all of the committee's recommendations and has circulated amendments and a supplementary explanatory memorandum in the chamber to give effect to these recommendations. Labor too supports the recommendations of the committee.</span>

Industry, government and the community all benefit when asset owners know in advance what is required of them and therefore can take the necessary steps without government needing to resort to regulatory intervention. The PJCIS report recommends sensible steps to ensure that such a dialogue is established in the implementation of this bill. It responds to evidence that was provided to the committee from industry stakeholders. I would like to take the opportunity to thank those stakeholders for their contribution to the committee's work. I commend these bills to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:59</span>):  The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 introduces, in essence, two new measures: a register of critical infrastructure and ministerial directions powers. The bill will apply to approximately 140 assets in the high-risk electricity, water, gas and ports sectors. According to the explanatory memorandum, the bill focuses primarily on the risk of sabotage, espionage and coercion in Australia's highest-risk critical infrastructure sectors and provides 'a risk based regulatory framework to manage national security risks from foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure'.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the register is to provide a more detailed understanding of who owns and controls critical infrastructure assets. I'll make some observations about ownership of critical infrastructure later in my speech. The register requires reporting entities who are either direct interest holders or the responsible entity of critical infrastructure assets to provide interest and control information and operational information within a certain time frame. The explanatory memorandum states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This information will assist the Government to identify who owns and controls the asset, its board structure, ownership rights of interest holders, and operational, outsourcing and offshoring information.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In January 2017, the Australian government established the Critical Infrastructure Centre and stated that the centre was established in response to the complex and evolving national security risks to critical infrastructure. But it ought come as no surprise to the Australian people that the government has abjectly failed to meaningfully consider one of the biggest threats to critical infrastructure in this country, and that is climate change. It's not just the direct risk of increasing levels of climate risk that will be the problem in the future. In a submission to the Critical Infrastructure Centre in March 2017, the CSIRO wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We provide the following comments to note that the discussion paper is silent on the potential effects of global environmental change, particularly climate change, in systematically altering the risks faced by critical infrastructure from the range of security-related sources …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO went on to say in their submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… climate change may be exacerbating some of the drivers of the key security risks addressed in the current paper, for example, placing greater pressure on foreign interests to consider espionage, sabotage or even coercion, because of growing pressures on the resources of those foreign interests.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only this bill that doesn't mention climate change as a risk; in fact, the government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Critical </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nfrastructure </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">esilience </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">trategy: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lan</span> is astoundingly silent on climate change.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia lags behind the US and some European countries in examining, assessing and responding to climate change risks in terms of national security. Vulnerabilities associated with national security and climate change are already increasing and exist now. These are not "future issues" that can be left for a decade before strategies are considered. The creation of a high-level taskforce to examine risks associated with climate change and national security is urgent and overdue.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to acknowledge that the 2016 Department of Defence white paper did identify climate change as one of the six key drivers in the development of Australia's security environment and as 'a major challenge for countries in Australia's immediate region'.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While that's the case, it appears the government has no plan and no appetite to do anything about our vulnerabilities in the areas of national security and infrastructure caused by climate disruption. Instead, it's been left to the Australian Greens, through the mechanisms available to us in this parliament, to establish two inquiries, which are currently running through Senate committees, into the impact of climate change and the threats posed by climate change to infrastructure and our national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to senators that we in the Australian Greens understand the political imperatives behind ramping up fear of attacks by terrorists or other hostile forces on the Australian people and on our infrastructure. We understand what has been a bipartisan approach, in effect, by the Labor and Liberal parties in this area. But I say to the Labor and Liberal parties: don't turn a blind eye to threats to national security and threats to our infrastructure posed by a disrupted climate that is caused by humans emitting greenhouse gases, which continue to rise and have been rising for the last couple of hundred years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is one of the biggest threats to our country's way of life. It is a threat to everything we do. It is a threat to the way we work, live and play. It's a threat to our health system and our education system, the way we support people with disabilities, our transport systems, our energy systems, our road networks and our ports. It is a threat to our way of life. It's driving mass displacement of people around the world, and we're not immune to those displacements here in Australia. The displacement, for example, of the Syrian people was driven, at least in part, by an unprecedented drought between 2007 and 2013. It displaced a large number of Syrian people from the country in Syria to the cities, which made the cities unsustainable and ultimately led to a mass displacement of Syrian people, which caused Australia, under then Prime Minister Tony Abbott, under pressure from the Australian Greens, to create a special intake of 12,000 Syrian people. They were displaced in part by a drought that we know was more likely to have occurred as a result of climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while the Australian Greens are comfortable with supporting this legislation and will be supporting it, we need to understand that this government has been putting the blinkers on and has effectively considered the threat posed to our country's infrastructure by terrorism and hostile forces as the only threat worthy of legislation of the type we're debating today. That paradigm, that mentality, lets down our country. It lets down our people and it lets down the very infrastructure that the government purports to want to protect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The outcomes from the two Senate inquiries that are currently running, thanks to being advocated for and moved by the Australian Greens, will make very interesting reading. At some of the hearings, we've discovered that, within the departmental bureaucracy of this country, there is significant acknowledgement and concern about the threats and risks posed by climate change to our infrastructure and to our way of life. The problem we've got is that that acknowledgement does not seem to percolate through to the highest levels of government. That's a real problem for our country and it's something that the Australian Greens will continue to advocate for and will continue to drive debate on in this place. If we were to not do that, if we were to join the rest of the Senate in staying silent on the threats and risks caused by climate change, ultimately we would be letting the Australian people down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and the materials associated with it make it very clear that foreign involvement in Australia's critical infrastructure creates risk. You can't read this bill, and the materials associated with it, in any other way. So I want to place on the record that this is one of the reasons—certainly not the only one—that the Australian Greens are proposing the nationalisation of some infrastructure assets that are currently in private hands. For example, we need to start returning Australia's electricity grid to public hands The privatisation of much of our energy generation infrastructure and much of our electricity transmission infrastructure has been an abject failure. It's failed to deliver system reliability, it's failed to play a meaningful role to date in bringing Australia's emissions down and it's failed to deliver reliable electricity at the lowest possible cost to the Australian people. That's why we're proposing to begin returning some of our energy infrastructure assets into public hands by nationalising the five privately owned interconnectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a senator from Tasmania, where we've learned in just the last few days that the state government is engaged in legal action against the owners of Basslink over the outage a couple of years ago that's been discussed at length in debate in the Senate, I say that Basslink, being privately owned, has not delivered for Tasmania. Senators would be aware that, when Basslink was first proposed by Hydro Tasmania back in the late nineties and ultimately the early 2000s, the Greens advocated against Basslink. We said we should be investing in making Tasmania energy self-sufficient. Having 100 per cent renewable energy was a legitimate aspiration for Tasmania prior to Basslink, which, of course, just provided another lifeline and another market opportunity for the dirty brown coal generators of the Latrobe Valley. We said that if we could embed 100 per cent renewable energy into all the goods and services that we produce in Tasmania it would give us a massive competitive advantage over the rest of the country and the rest of the world. We didn't support that investment and the $90 million-plus per annum that Hydro Tasmania is still paying as a facility fee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we'd been heeded back then, we wouldn't have had the energy crisis that Tasmania has had. The batteries nearly ran flat and the dams nearly ran empty because of the incompetence of the Hodgman Liberal government and the then energy minister, Matthew Groom. Instead, we could have shown Australia and the rest of the world what leadership on renewable energy looks like. Of course, history shows that Hydro Tasmania, despite some internal contention, went ahead and recommended to government that Basslink be put in place—and, as I said, that threw a much-needed lifeline to the dirty brown coal generators of the Latrobe Valley. That drove Australia's emissions profile up and it drove Tasmania's emissions profile up—when we have the best network of hydro-electric power in the country, renewable energy and ultra-low emissions that we could have actually used to drive prosperity, wellbeing and competitive advantage for our state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we make no bones about it. We want to see the five privately owned interconnectors in Australia nationalised, returned to public hands, because neo-liberalism and laissez-faire capitalism have abjectly failed the people they purport to serve. That failure is for a number of reasons but ultimately one of the key drivers has been a failure to price in the environmental and social impacts that are delivered by the private companies who own infrastructure and other assets under the current system of laissez-faire capitalism. Of course we need to price in things like carbon, environmental toxins and social harm, and the Australian Greens are very determined to keep working and advocating for those things to happen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that, as I said, we want to make sure that we begin renationalising, or, in some cases, simply nationalising, many of the energy assets that exist in this country. If the government is so concerned about the foreign ownership of and foreign influence on infrastructure assets, perhaps the government needs to ask itself whether or not it, on behalf of the Australian people, would be better off owning those assets itself. We in the Australian Greens have asked ourselves that question, and we have answered that question with a resounding yes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many pieces of infrastructure in this country that are currently in private hands would deliver far better returns for the Australian people if they were put back into public hands and public ownership. The infrastructure in this country was created by the blood, sweat and tears of Australian workers, and its privatisation has abjectly failed to deliver for the people that it was supposed to serve. It's time for a mature debate in this country about the ownership of our infrastructure, the risks to that infrastructure of foreign ownership—which this legislation, in some ways, is designed to mitigate—and, most crucially, whether or not that infrastructure would be better off in public hands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We call on the government and the Labor Party—who, to date, to my knowledge, haven't intervened or participated in this debate—to get on board with the discussion, because it's beyond time that we had this conversation in Australia; it's beyond time that we had this conversation in this parliament. As with so many other things, like the issues of a royal commission into banks and a federal anticorruption authority, it will be the Australian Greens that will drive the debate and, in having that debate, will ensure that we consider the ultimate public good. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  Let me put it on the record: One Nation is totally opposed to any sale of our assets. I have said, for the last 22 years, that neither our infrastructure, such as water, sewage, telecommunications and electricity, nor our defence services should ever, in any way, shape or form, end up in the hands of foreigners; these services should always remain in the hands of the government and be produced at a reasonable cost for the people of Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find it amazing that we have before us the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017. It basically says that owners and operators of prescribed ports, electricity and water assets will be required to provide information detailing the operational and ownership control arrangements of their assets. The government may direct these owners and operators to do, or not do, certain things with respect to their asset when there is a perceived risk to national security. That beggars belief. I can't believe that—'a perceived risk to national security'—when we've allowed our most important assets to be sold to foreign ownership.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… started the recent process by privatising the Port of Brisbane in 2010 (selling a 99-year lease for what is now a seemingly cheap $2.1 billion) in order to replenish its empty Treasury coffers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what it comes down to, empty Treasury coffers, because neither side can actually manage the cheque book. When it gets to this point they say, 'Let's just sell off the assets.' That is clearly what happened with this selling off of our assets and the rising costs of electricity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from the renewable energy and the billions of dollars we're paying to prop it up, the cost is escalating, because these companies own the power plants, just like what happened in South Australia. A foreigner owned the power plant in South Australia. It has the highest cost, along with Queensland, in the world for electricity—privatisation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Have a look at the recent article titled 'Australian port sold for $7.3 billion to consortium; China fund among backers'. It states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A consortium of global and domestic funds, backed by investors including China Investment Corp, agreed to buy Australia's busiest port for a higher-than-expected A$9.7 billion … a sign that tough equity markets are helping fuel appetite for infrastructure.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The sell-off is part of Australia's more than A$100 billion privatization program, where state and federal governments are trying to cut debt and bankroll capital works by selling "mature" infrastructure assets—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">that they will control. Let me tell you something: I'm not an economist, but the fact is that companies buy these infrastructure projects to make money out of them. It's not about providing a service and feeling good about it. It's all about what they can make out of it. A lot of the time they don't even pay tax in this country, but we're allowing them to take over important assets. What about the 99-year lease of the Darwin Port? This is where crucial product comes into our country, into our ports, and they own the ports. They can charge whatever they want from when they have ownership and we've got no control over it. More about ports:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">New South Wales (under a Coalition Government) followed Queensland's lead by selling Port Botany and Port Kembla in 2012 and raking in a healthy $5.1 billion … The NSW Treasurer, Mike Baird, has also just announced that expressions of interest are open for a 98-year lease for the Port of Newcastle.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And you had the then Victorian opposition leader, Daniel Andrews—Labor—who proposed to 'sell a long-term lease of the Port of Melbourne as the cornerstone of their Project 10,000'. They can't manage money, so they're selling all the assets. These assets are owned by the people, and yet governments are selling them off.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… The Future Fund, and Canada's Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System will each get a fifth of Port of Melbourne following the sale, which is packaged as a 50-year lease.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone around the world thinks that Australia is a good investment but the Australian government itself. Then, just recently, didn't we hear the coalition government talking about using our trillion-dollar fund to go to America and buy infrastructure over there? We're investing over there but we're not investing in our own country with our dollars. What about us? People are screaming out for the infrastructure that we need here. These bills beggar belief.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You're selling off all our important assets. You allowed the sale of Cubbie Station—another important landmark owned by Australians—and it was sold to the Chinese. Cubbie Station is important for its water, and yet we've sold it. We've sold so much of our land to foreigners. Our public housing is being sold to foreigners, putting it out of the hands of Australians who want to own their own homes but can't afford to.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just one side of politics; this is both sides. We have seen it for years and years. Both the coalition and Labor have done absolutely nothing about it. You keep speaking the same old rhetoric all the time. Once you're in opposition, you blame the other side as if they're the ones that have caused it. You're both to blame for this. You both have actually destroyed this country. You're getting rid of our important infrastructure. That's why electricity costs are going up and up and up. You're selling off our ports. You've sold off land in this country. You've put in place legislation to stop the foreign ownership of housing here, but you don't follow through. All you've done is to put more and more red tape on it, to make it look as if you're doing the right thing, but you don't follow through. You're tying us up so tightly in this country but you're not addressing the real concerns of the Australian people. So stop blaming each other and do something about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By introducing this bill, yes, you're calling for accountability. But the horse has bolted. Now what are we going to do about it? Well, we'd better address this for security reasons. Is that going to stop you from allowing foreign ownership of our most important assets in this country? I don't think so—because you're trying to catch up, because we're in so much debt. Look at where you are wasting the moneys, in a lot of these bureaucrats' wages, as I pointed out. You were paying the CEO of Australia Post $5.6 million a year, which was ridiculous. What a lot of these CEOs get paid is over the top. The number of public servants and all these consultants' fees that you've been paying are over the top. I cannot believe that you've got to the stage where you've got to sell our assets—the taxpayers' assets—to balance the books!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation will be supporting this bill. But I had to have my say over this, because it beggars belief that you've allowed things to get to this stage. I'd suggest that you really have a good look at who is putting in to buy up our assets in this country, and say, 'No!' Start holding on to our assets for the Australian people. You've given so much control to other countries, it's an absolute disgrace!</span>

We are all in agreement that critical infrastructure is integral to our prosperity. Secure and resilient infrastructure does underpin the effective functioning of our society. It ensures we have continuous access to essential services for everyday life, such as food, water, energy and communications. The Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017 and the Security of Critical Infrastructure (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017 support the government's efforts to safeguard Australia's critical infrastructure. They will supplement existing federal, state and territory regulations and ensure that the government has the necessary powers to protect Australia from the national security risks of sabotage, espionage and coercion stemming from malicious foreign involvement in our critical infrastructure. The bills reflect consultation with states and territories and industry stakeholders. Importantly, they will also incorporate all nine recommendations made by the PJCIS. I thank members of the committee for their comprehensive review of the bills. Amendments have already been circulated to give effect to these. Earlier I also tabled the government's response to the committee report. We indicated in that that we accept all nine of the committee's recommendations. I'm pleased that the government, the opposition and the committee could work together to progress this important legislation.</span>

They strike an appropriate regulatory balance by acknowledging the shared responsibility for managing national security risks while empowering the Commonwealth to intervene to mitigate a risk where existing regimes cannot be used. With these bills the government is taking the necessary steps to strengthen the security and resilience of Australia's critical infrastructure. I commend the bills to colleagues.</span>

Again I thank the committee for their comprehensive and timely review of the bills. The government has accepted all nine recommendations made by the committee. The government will give effect to the committee's recommendations through these amendments: providing greater clarity and examples on how the legislation is intended to operate in an addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which has been tabled; considering fuel security issues as part of the next national energy security assessment; and, upon passage, providing detailed guidance and support for industry on their obligations under the legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments implementing the committee's recommendations will: amend the definition of 'direct interest holder' and introduce definitions of 'influence or control' and 'associates' to ensure that direct interest holders report on all entities who may be in a position to influence or control the asset or the direct interest holder; introduce an exemption from reporting for moneylenders where the moneylender arrangement does not put the lender, holding entity or subsidiary in a position to influence or control the asset; require that a person receives written notice if they are subject to an ASIO adverse security assessment as well as information on his or her right to apply for merits review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and include a requirement for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review the bills within three years of the bills receiving royal assent. I have already tabled associated supplementary explanatory memorandums to provide details on these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendments also address some minor technical issues, including refining the definition of 'critical water asset' to clarify that it applies to one or more systems managed by a utility where those systems ultimately service more than 100,000 connections, and ensuring the definition of 'protected information' applies to documents as well as information. I seek leave to move amendments (1) to (20) on sheet KE133 together.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  Before proceeding to deal with the amendments, I wish to place on record a response to some of the remarks made by Senator McKim in the second reading debate. Senator McKim made a series of remarks about climate change and the impact of climate change on infrastructure. He went on to make a very unrealistic, unreasonable and inaccurate characterisation of the Labor Party's position in relation to these issues, and that characterisation cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind Senator McKim and others in the chamber that, in 2007, it was the Labor opposition, under Kevin Rudd, and the states and territories who commissioned Professor Garnaut to undertake a very significant examination of the impact of climate change on the Australian economy and society. Professor Garnaut did an incredibly detailed piece of work—which I actually had the great fortune to be part of in a very, very small way—which, amongst other things, examined the impact of climate change on assets, including the infrastructure sectors that are the subject of this bill. Upon coming to government, the Labor Party and the then Prime Minister committed the Commonwealth to participate in the Garnaut climate change review, and the Labor Party then established an entire department dedicated to prosecuting both climate change emissions reduction and climate change adaptation. That department had an entire division that dealt with climate change adaptation and it did extensive work with the infrastructure sector, engaging with that sector on how to deal with the impacts of climate change on its assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It happens that I also subsequently worked in the private sector with a range of businesses in the infrastructure sector, nearly all of whom were actively engaged in assessing climate change risks to their businesses. In fact, I've spoken about this in this chamber on many occasions. Senator McKim's claim that it is only the Greens political party that has any interest in this issue and that it is the Greens political party that has led on this issue is laughable. It is inconsistent with the historical record, and I rise to place that on record in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition is pleased to support the amendments moved by Senator Fifield. They reflect the recommendations of the PJCIS. I note in particular the amendments in relation to the review function for the PJCIS. The amendments provide that the committee will review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the act within three years and examine whether or not it would be appropriate to have a unified scheme that covers all infrastructure assets, including telecommunication assets. Telecommunication assets are presently the subject of a separate regulatory regime, and the PJCIS asked government to consider whether or not at some point in the future these two regimes might sensibly be merged. The amendments before the chamber give effect to that recommendation and I commend them to the house.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Senator McAllister often makes excellent, outstanding, thoughtful and intelligent contributions to this Senate, but the one she has just made does not fall into any of those categories. I'll check the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, but I don't recall saying that the ALP hadn't participated in a debate around climate change. Clearly, the ALP has participated in that debate. It hasn't been some of their finest work, I might add.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKIM:</span>
                    </a>  They were dragged, kicking and screaming into action on a price on carbon by the Australian Greens, and both Senator Cameron and Senator McAllister know that full well. As I said, I'll check the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>, but the point that I recall making is that the ALP hasn't contributed to the debate around nationalising some infrastructure that is currently in private hands. If Senator McAllister or Senator Cameron or anyone else wants to correct me on that, I'm happy to be corrected, but I haven't noticed Labor out advocating for the nationalisation of transmission infrastructure, for example, as the Australian Greens have. That's the accusation that I recall making. I don't want to get into a tit for tat here, but I think you'll find that Senator McAllister has just engaged in what we should these days call a straw person argument and has torn down and trampled all over a straw person, because, in fact, the things she was objecting to that she claims I had said I actually didn't say. With regard to these amendments, I think it's an indication of maturity from the government to accept the recommendations of the joint standing committee, and these amendments will be supported by the Australian Greens.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  Today we debate two bills that at least in terms of intent are uncontroversial. In fact, Labor will support schedule 1 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 and the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017 without hesitation. Schedule 2 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 provides for the appointment of a productivity commissioner with extensive skills and experience in dealing with policies and programs that have an impact on Indigenous persons and experience with dealing with one or more communities of Indigenous persons. Personally, I am always very happy to get some good people into the Productivity Commission. However, Labor has raised concerns about the manner in which indigeneity is defined in schedule 2 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017. We'll have more to say about this in the committee stage of the bill; however, we will support the bill with the amendment that the government has circulated to address this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the details of the Treasury laws amendment bill, schedule 1 makes amendments to the Corporations Act 2001 to strengthen protections against manipulation of financial benchmarks. Firstly, schedule 1 of the bill will make manipulation of all financial benchmarks used in Australia a specific criminal offence and subject to civil penalties. Individuals will be liable for fines of up to greater than three times the benefit they gain, or $945,000, which is 4,500 penalty units. A body corporate will be liable to fines of up to the greater of $9.45 million—that is, 45,000 penalty units—three times any benefit from manipulation or 10 per cent of the entity's turnover in the previous year. Civil penalties will also apply. Currently, manipulation of financial benchmarks is enforced using existing laws relating to market manipulation, false trading and market rigging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, schedule 1 to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 will establish a new licensing regime requiring administrators of certain designated significant financial benchmarks to obtain a new benchmark administrator licence from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Administration of financial benchmarks at present does not require a licence and is not a regulated activity under current law. ASIC will have the power to designate significant financial benchmarks with the consent of the minister. Financial benchmarks can be so designated if the benchmark is systemically important, could cause instability or would materially impact Australian investors if the availability or integrity of the benchmark were disrupted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill will give ASIC powers to make rules imposing a regulatory framework for licensed benchmark administrators and related matters. This framework will reflect a set of principles released by the International Organization of Securities Commissions. The bill will also give ASIC the power to compel market participants to make submissions to ensure the continued generation of a financial benchmark during times of financial market stress. This is a power of last resort. The ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017 supports this regime by adding benchmark administrator licences to the list of entities from which the ASIC may recover its regulatory costs under the ASIC supervisory cost recovery levy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ASIC industry funding model is based on the principle that ASIC's regulatory costs should be borne by the entities that benefit from or cause the need for this activity. ASIC's regulatory costs are apportioned each year between subsectors according to the amount of ASIC's regulatory activity that they account for. Regulations provide methods and formulas for how ASIC's regulatory costs are to be apportioned across the various sectors and subsectors that it regulates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017 makes amendments to the ASIC cost recovery levy that corresponds to the new regulatory requirements in schedule 1 to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017. Labor will support these measures which strengthen our laws against the manipulation of financial benchmarks. We have seen cases of manipulation of financial benchmarks around the world. In Australia, ASIC legal action regarding alleged manipulation of the bank bill swap rates by banks continues. Settlements with NAB and ANZ regarding attempted manipulation of the bank bill swap rate were struck with ASIC last year. Justice Jagot of the Federal Court is reported to have said that the conduct of traders was a gross departure from basic standards of commercial decency, honesty and fairness and that the Australian public had a right to be shocked and disgusted at what took place. These are very serious matters. As ASIC has noted, manipulation of the bank bill swap rate is not a victimless crime. There are winners and losers, and those winners and losers move around depending on whether the rate is moved up or down artificially. The bank bill swap rate impacts Australian businesses because it impacts financial products used by many Australian businesses to manage their financial affairs. We welcome the change in schedule 1 to this bill to strengthen protections against the manipulation of financial benchmarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also welcome the corresponding changes in the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017. However, we note the poor record of those opposite when it comes to consumer protections in the financial sector. This is from a government that ignored the need for a royal commission into the banks. By contrast, Labor has a proud record of standing up against misconduct in the financial services sector. The previous Labor government introduced the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. This was a single, standard and nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation and oversight. There was also Labor's enactment of the Future of Financial Advice reforms. The coalition voted against FOFA in the House. They voted against FOFA in the Senate. When they got into government, they tried to do everything they could to wind back the Future of Financial Advice reforms. They tried to hollow them out. They tried to gut them by legislation and then by regulation. Labor fought hard to protect FOFA. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasingly in 2016 ASIC found that FOFA requirements specifically opposed by the coalition helped to bring to light the massive fees-for-no-service scandal. The October 2016 ASIC report into the scandal showed that Australia's big four banks and AMP had spent years charging customers fees for services they did not receive. ASIC's report estimated that they were going to have to pay back nearly $180 million, excluding interest, to over 200,000 customers. In May 2017 these figures were revised upwards. The government ignored a range of examples like that for over 600 days—600 days when they stubbornly resisted the urgent need for a royal commission into the banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will move to the Productivity Commission reforms. Schedule 2 of the Treasury Law Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 provides for the appointment of a commissioner with extensive skills and experience in dealing with policies and programs that have an impact on Indigenous persons and experience in dealing with one or more communities of Indigenous persons. The new law also increases the maximum number of commissioners, not including the commission chair, from 11 to 12.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the gap </span>report statement to parliament on 14 February 2017, the Prime Minister announced a new role for the commission in Indigenous policy evaluation and the expansion of the commission to include a new commissioner to oversee this work. According to the explanatory memorandum:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of high profile reports have highlighted the need for more evaluation of policies and programs that have an impact on Indigenous persons, including the Commission's <span style="font-style:italic;">Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage Report 2016</span>. This report included case studies of programs that are making a difference as 'things that work', but the report found that only a relatively small number have been rigorously evaluated. There is a pressing need for further evaluation to better understand which policies and programs are effective in improving outcomes for Indigenous persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the inclusion of a Productivity Commissioner with expertise and remit for policy matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There is, however, a significant issue that concerns Labor regarding the definition of 'Indigenous person' in the legislation. In the legislation as introduced, the definition of 'Indigenous person' is based on race and descent rather than the standard three-part definition based on descent, identification and acceptance in the community. We note that the government has circulated an amendment with regard to this definition, which Labor will support. As I've said, we'll have more to say about this issue in the committee stage of the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor will support schedule 2 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017, with the amendment that the government has circulated. Labor supports the changes in schedule 1 to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 to strengthen the rules against manipulation of financial benchmarks. We support the associated changes to the ASIC supervisory cost recovery levy in the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017. However, we note that these changes regarding financial benchmarks come from a government that has a record of turning a blind eye to misconduct in the banks and the financial sector. They come from a government that will always back the big end of town over ordinary Australians. Nothing could epitomise more the backing of the big end of town against ordinary Australians than this government's determination not to have a royal commission inquiry into the banks and this government's determination to give those selfsame banks something like $8 billion in tax cuts under its tax cut policies. This is a government that does whatever it can to minimise the impact of decency on banks. This is a government that regretfully announced a royal commission after the public were determined, with the support of the Labor Party, to have a banking royal commission. These bills are important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission has done some good work and some pretty ordinary work over a long period of time. If we're going to have an Indigenous commissioner, that Indigenous commissioner should be supported by the Productivity Commission, ensured proper resources in the Productivity Commission and be welcomed into the Productivity Commission, which seems to be a closed shop for those with highly conservative ideas and policy proposals on most of the issues that they deal with—not all, but most of them—and the Productivity Commission has to ensure that this Indigenous commissioner has the resources and the framework to deal with the issues of importance to Indigenous Australians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CAMERON:</span>
                    </a>  We've got Senator Williams interjecting, and I'll take the interjection. Senator Williams, you were a lone voice in the coalition government about bad banking practices and the excesses of banks—not only bad behaviour but also illegal behaviour in banks. I don't know why you're getting all agitated now, because you've done a great job on this. Certainly, you will be remembered as one of the few coalition senators, if not the only coalition senator, who has stood up against bad behaviour by the banks. It's a credit to you. So just settle down. You don't need to get agitated. We're dealing with this issue. We're supporting what you have determined to do, and that is to make sure that banks are accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have to say that you were one of the few on the government benches who was prepared to take the banks to task when they obviously needed to be taken to task. I'm sure, Senator Williams, through the chair, that you are not one of those who regretted the banking royal commission, because it's something that you took up for a long period of time as an absolute necessity to make sure that people in this country get treated fairly by the banks. It's just such a problem that you were an outlier among the coalition, that you were on your own, that you were a lone voice from this government against the excesses of banks. So I'm glad you intervened. I'm glad you reminded me about what a lone voice you were in the coalition in standing up against the bad behaviour of banks. You and I were on committees together in the past. We were both on the economics committee. It wasn't something that you woke up one morning and decided to run with. You were dealing with this for a long period of time before you became publicly vocal about the bad behaviour of banks. Then, when you did, you did a terrific job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not normally one to stand up here and praise an opposition senator, but in this area Senator Williams has got a good record. It's a pity he's got such a bad record in so many other areas, but in that area he's done a good job. That's why Labor, in this debate, are happy to support the position that the government's put up with the amendment to make sure that it's not up to a minister to determine who is an Indigenous person or not and that the standard proposal is dealt with. These are issues that are long overdue in addressing. These are issues that will go to the benefit of the Australian public. Labor support these bills as important bills. We certainly want to make sure that there are never race based definitions in any bills that come before the Senate, so Labor welcome the agreement of the government to remove any race based definitions in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These two bills, at least in intent, as I've said, are uncontroversial. We will support both of these bills. They are bills that are important. The concerns we have raised have been dealt with by the government. These will, in conjunction with the banking royal commission that we championed for so long, along with Senator Williams, make sure that things are better for ordinary Australians in dealing with banks in the future. The coalition should stop coming in here and just attacking unions. They should have been attacking the banks with the same venom they attack the union movement in this place. We would have had a better country, because the banks were not behaving well. The royal commission is exposing that. We support the bills. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I just want to make a brief contribution to this. Like others in the chamber, the Greens want to get home to our families, friends and others tonight. The substantial legislation around the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 and the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill has already passed the Senate. At the risk of being overly simplistic, these bills are tweaking the edges, but they're making necessary changes. I just want to put on record that the Greens will be supporting the bills. We are looking at Labor's amendments at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to put on record that the Greens have been a part of this process. In 2014, the Senate Economics References Committee had a very important investigation into ASIC. I think that's been one of the defining moments of the Senate since I've been here in the last six years. I was part of that particular inquiry. Before Senator Williams leaves the chamber, I would like to also recognise the contribution he made. In fact, he asked me to join that committee and inquiry, and I did. Not only did we get the recommendation that we needed a cost recovery model for ASIC—and this is hopefully the end of that, and we've achieved that in four years—but much more came out of that inquiry. It was an inquiry that, although it started as an inquiry into ASIC, ended up being an inquiry into Commonwealth Bank. Later, that snowballed and cascaded into the action that we've taken in this place on the banks in the last five years. We saw a scandal at the Commonwealth Bank—clear fraud, misconduct and unethical behaviour—and the Senate Economics Committee made an unprecedented recommendation. I think we needed a royal commission just into the Commonwealth Bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens campaigned on getting a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector back in 2015. We also had a really in-depth and very troubling inquiry into forestry managed investment schemes, which also showed the need for a royal commission into the banks. Why? Because we needed the coercive powers and the resources of a royal commission. The Senate did a fantastic job over numerous inquiries looking into financial misconduct. At the end of the day we can highlight these things but we seldom compel witnesses, search premises or documents, or even compel documents. These are the kind of things I hope the royal commission will look at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to get it on record today that the Greens are very happy to have played a part in this legislation and in getting this here today, as well as the push that this chamber has made. I would recognise that the changes to the FOFA legislation around a similar time were also pivotal. You could almost feel the wind change in this place when the FOFA disallowance regulations came up. I compliment Labor on leading that disallowance, and we were happy to play a part in that. That took a lot of organisation and it was a really important moment in actually cracking down on financial misconduct in this country and getting some laws and regulations in place. That's all I'll say today because I understand that we need to move on. But we've been a big part of this, and it's a good example of the Senate working together to get good legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I rise to oppose the Treasury bills before us today—the Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Measures No. 5) Bill 2017 and the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Amendment Bill 2017. These bills burden financial markets with unwarranted red tape and burden the Productivity Commission with an unwarranted commissioner. The bills will mean financial service providers will face criminal penalties for intentionally influencing an index price or interest rate that the government considers to be a financial benchmark, such as the bank bill swap rate. Individuals will face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of nearly a million dollars, while businesses face fines of nearly $10 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is outrageous. Intentionally influencing a price should not be a crime even if others put great importance on that price. If someone is stupid enough to base their decisions on the price of eggs, you shouldn't be banned from taking advantage of this by buying up eggs and driving up the price. The government says that intentionally influencing a price is already a breach of civil penalty provisions. This is wishful thinking. The government's case against ANZ, NAB and Westpac for alleged market manipulation and unconscionable conduct in relation to the bank bill swap rate is still before the courts. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it fails.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial service providers will also need government approval to administer something that the government considers to be a financial benchmark, even though the provider might not want what they administer to be used as a benchmark for others. Someone who fails to get this approval will face five years in jail and a six-figure fine. Once approved, a financial service provider will need to pay the government a fee for the privilege of being regulated. This is akin to Tattslotto needing the approval of Lottoland and needing to pay Lottoland a fee simply because Lottoland chooses to use Tattslotto as a benchmark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is regulation gone mad. Regulators seem to view financial markets as something they need to control. They reveal a Soviet-style mindset that is not accepted anywhere else in the economy. Part of the reason for this is that no-one has sympathy for financial service providers. Unfortunately, every bit of red tape on financial services reduces the chances of real competition in financial services where small players enter the market to offer better, cheaper services to everyday Australians. Part of the reason regulators get away with Soviet-style regulation of financial markets is that financial markets seem to them to be more complex than other markets. But this complexity is a reason to be particularly worried about regulation, because there is a massive risk that regulators will get it wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury bills before us today also require an additional commissioner at the Productivity Commission, with experience in dealing with Indigenous communities. I fear that this lends weight to the questionable idea that those suffering disadvantage know how to overcome that disadvantage and that we must not pursue policies that disadvantaged people oppose. I think it more likely that unpopular policy options, like abolishing the Community Development Program that keeps people in squalid, remote communities, offer the best chance for overcoming disadvantage. For this reason, and because we do not need more Soviet-style regulation of financial markets, I oppose these Treasury bills.</span>

Before I go to those comments, I want to address the comments made by Senator Leyonhjelm, because I could not disagree more strongly with the comments that he's made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When one looks at the attitude of the major banks to this, particularly on the issue of the bank bill swap rate, ASIC has finally got onto the case and has highlighted the fact that there has been a deliberate rigging of a key benchmark rate which sets so much of what goes on in the financial community. We know that the BBSW is one, which links into home mortgages. It also links in as a reference point and sets rates for most business loans, through to personal lending rates. If the banks are manipulating this particular benchmark rate for their own purposes, then this is a very, very significant matter. It's not a question of Soviet-style control; this is a question of addressing a very real matter of public policy. As Senator Cameron has indicated, this is not a victimless act; this is a bank taking advantage of their market power and their ability to manipulate rates for their own purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We look at the ASIC action in respect of the Commonwealth Bank and we know that there are emails which show communication between the CBA's head of swaps and the CBA Treasury official. The email to the swaps dealer said: 'I think it would be in the bank's interest if you didn't borrow three months' bills on the 15th. We have almost $5 billion setting on that date.' There should have been Chinese walls in place between the different parts of the bank, but those did not exist. It is very clear, in my view, that these are examples of deliberate manipulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note that we have just seen reports that mortgage rates are in fact rising without the RBA doing anything about interest rates. We've had the news that Suncorp will lift its owner-occupier mortgage rate by 0.05 percentage points to a standard rate of 5.6 per cent. The article that I'm referring to is by Mr Mata, dated 27 March. It indicates that the size of the lift is not the impressive part of this piece of information; it's the reason for the lift that is important. Mr Carter, the CEO, Banking and Wealth, at Suncorp, said that the decision to hike rates was based on the increasing costs of funding, the costs associated with regulatory change and the US interest rate hikes. So, they've seen higher interest costs for wholesale funding. As I've said, this is not a victimless crime or an abstract matter; this is a matter where our regulators have a legitimate role to step in and stop the sort of manipulation that we're seeing. As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and as chair of the Senate Economics References Committee, I've had the opportunity to speak with ASIC on a regular basis and I've seen a lift in the performance of ASIC in recent times. I welcome their activity in pursuing the major banks in respect of this matter, because it seems that all four major banks were engaged in this type of activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can recall the scandal in London a few years ago with the LIBOR—a similar benchmark rate. We saw examples of the manipulation of that particular benchmark rate, and we were told that that type of thing couldn't happen in Australia to the BBSW. However, unfortunately, it has come to pass, or certainly it's been alleged that that is the case. I note that ASIC has been able to settle matters against two of the banks, and I believe that there are ongoing matters that are being pursued. This is not a victimless crime; this is an area where we do need to have proper intervention by the regulators to address these issues. If there's one action by the banks which, to me, justified the royal commission, it is the manipulation of the BBSW. It shows that the culture within the banks is one where they are open to doing this sort of thing. It's quite clear that their culture dictates that, if there is an opportunity to do something, they will take that opportunity, whatever the consequences to others in the Australian community, so I do welcome ASIC's intervention.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also to the government's credit that they are looking at increasing the penalties in relation to this matter, so that the manipulation of all financial benchmarks used in Australia will be a specific criminal offence and subject to the penalties that others have talked about. A body corporate will be liable to fines of up to the greater of $9.45 million, which is 45,000 penalty units, or three times any benefit from the manipulation or 10 per cent of the entity's turnover in the previous year. Civil penalties will also apply.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills set out a number of the other benchmarks that are to be caught within the regime, and I welcome that. This will give ASIC powers to make rules imposing this regulatory framework, and the framework is based on a set of principles released by the International Organization of Securities Commissions. The Senate economics committee has been looking at this particular issue over a period of time, and it's pleasing to see the government acting on this matter. We commend the bills.</span>

The amendment removes the proposed statutory definition of 'Indigenous person'. In the absence of a statutory definition, the expression 'Indigenous person' is intended as a composite expression to encompass Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. The intention is that this expression takes its ordinary meaning. Based on case law, the ordinary meaning of an 'Indigenous person' is understood, as also outlined by Senator Cameron in his contribution, to be a person who is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent and who is accepted as such by the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community with which the person identifies. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  Labor will support the amendment. In the legislation as originally presented, the definition of 'Indigenous person' was based on race and descent rather than the standard definition based on the three-part definition of descent, identification and acceptance in the community. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Law Reform Commission, amongst others, the most widely adopted definition of 'Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander', the Commonwealth working definition, is: 'An Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin and who is accepted as such by the community with which the person associates.' In fact, the descent-identification-acceptance definition is the very one used by Commonwealth departments in practice. It echoes Justice Gerard Brennan's words from the 1992 Mabo judgement, which noted indigeneity as being a combination of 'biological descent from Indigenous people and mutual recognition of a particular person's membership by that person and by the elders or other persons enjoying traditional authority amongst those people'. The three-part definition was also used by the former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC, to determine eligibility to vote and stand in elections to ATSIC regional and national councils, and was tested a number of times in the courts when various elections were challenged.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has argued in the Senate Select Committee on Strengthening Multiculturalism's report that it was necessary to move away from race-based terminology in legislation and in policy. Let me read from the Labor senators' additional comments to the Senate multiculturalism report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1.1   The question of 'race' as a 'concept' and 'term' is used widely in parliamentary language, legislation and in the construction of entities with 'race' as part of their nomenclature. The issue of 'race' is a concern to Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1.2   The use of the term 'race' has the capacity to reinforce negative perceptions of others from different cultures. This matter ought to be seriously considered by us and we ought to consider ways by which the leadership of the parliament could begin to change attitudes around the use of the term race in our multicultural society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1.3 The Australian Labor Party notes that, in the 2012 Final Report of the Expert Panel on Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the Constitution, the Expert Panel proposed the removal of s. 51(26) and s. 25 of the Australian Constitution because of their reliance upon 'race' as an 18th Century concept, and the embedded racist thinking that governs their construction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1.4 Race is used in other applications and has been the basis or cause of much discrimination in Australia as a consequence. The constitutional changes recommended by the previous Expert Panel … have not been proceeded with so the Australian Constitution remains racist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that governments of the past, both coalition and Labor, have used the definition as drafted in this legislation. It is part of the Commonwealth legislative drafting guidelines. But, as Labor senators have noted, it is not the 18th century. It's time to demonstrate leadership on how Australia can change attitudes around the use of the term 'race'. It's important for reconciliation, it's important for multiculturalism and it's important for egalitarianism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note that the Treasurer's office engaged in good faith on this matter. Labor approached them shortly after the legislation was introduced. We explained our concerns and proposed an amendment, which was considered. The government, we understand, will now move an amendment to remove the race based definition of Indigeneity in the bill. We will support that amendment. I want to thank the Treasurer's office for engaging on the issue and coming to this workable compromise that will prevent the Productivity Commission measure from any further delay. Should the Senate agree to that amendment, we will not move the amendment circulated on behalf of Senator Dodson proposing to put the three-part definition into the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note that this could well have been resolved months ago had the Prime Minister's office returned Labor's calls. This was a point we made to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> a few weeks ago in an article that makes some interesting historical points. Firstly, it noted the words of Justice Brennan that I quoted earlier. Secondly, when detailing Senator Scullion's suggestion that Labor's amendment as circulated would require further consultation, the reporter, Stephen Fitzpatrick, wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Asking an actual indigenous Australian for legislative advice? Well, there's a ruling on that, too. In a 1998 Federal Court case on indigenous identity, Justice Ron Merkel said it was a shame the matter had been "left by a parliament that is not representative of Aboriginal people to be determined by a court which is also not representative of Aboriginal people". Perhaps one day, he mused, such a ruling "might be made by independently constituted bodies or tribunals which are representative of Aboriginal people".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is issues like this one that underscore the imperative for the government to listen to and embrace the Uluru Statement from the Heart. As opposition leader Bill Shorten said in response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the Gap</span> report, we have to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… include a meaningful say for the First Australians in the decisions that affect their lives—a Voice to parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor will legislate one should we win government. The Prime Minister has ruled the voice out. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It appears the Prime Minister is also reluctant to accept Labor's amendments to move away from race based definitions in legislation. We have consulted on this issue. Labor's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander caucus was attuned to the issue and sought expert opinion. The use of Labor's proposed definition is not unprecedented. Although Commonwealth legislation has used the standard definition, the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 defines 'Aboriginal person' as such—and I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Aboriginal person</span> means a person who:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia, and</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) identifies as an Aboriginal person, and</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims the three-part definition will cause constitutional issues. Those we have consulted said this is a shaky claim. The three-part definition was upheld by the High Court as giving meaning to the expression 'Aboriginal race' within section 51(xxvi) of the Constitution by Justice Deane in the Commonwealth of Australia v Tasmania (1983) 158 CLR 1.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If a constitutional concern was present, it surely would have been tested by now. Constitutional lawyer Professor Megan Davis has been commenting on this matter publicly over the last week, in particular in response to the story in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>. Professor Davis's concerns are about the use of the two-part race based definition in this legislation and how such race based definitions deny Indigenous communities sovereignty of their own identity, not about a constitutional challenge. Nonetheless, the amendment put forward by the government is a workable compromise that presents the race based definition being used in this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will support this amendment, but what we want to indicate clearly is that the Aboriginal community have indicated that they want a voice. We should be listening to that position. We should be providing a voice to Aboriginal communities around this country. The Uluru statement is extremely important. The Uluru statement is something that was subject to detailed consideration by Indigenous Australians over a period of time. Many points of view were put, and they've come to the view that their voice should be in parliament. As I've indicated, we—I think belatedly, as has been the want of parliaments over generations in this country—now need to deal with this issue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To have a commissioner for Indigenous issues in the Productivity Commission is an important step forward. I'm not a great fan of the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission gets many things wrong, but it gets some things right. What it needs is an Indigenous voice to instruct the Productivity Commission about what the challenges are that Indigenous communities face in this country. As shadow minister for housing and homelessness, I talk to many Australians about housing and homelessness issues. I've talked to Australians in regional Australia and I've talked to them in the cities. There are huge problems of housing and homelessness in this country, but when you look at the problems faced by Indigenous Australians in remote and regional Australia, they are massively greater than the problems faced by other Australians. These are issues that the Productivity Commission—who are there to advise government on productivity issues, but do also, from time to time, dip their toe into social issues—needs to be aware of. Having an Indigenous commissioner with knowledge and understanding of Indigenous issues is the right thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I completely reject what Senator Leyonhjelm has put, that this is an unwarranted burden. That is white fella talk of the worst kind. Why would an Indigenous person in the Productivity Commission be, as Senator Leyonhjelm has argued, an unwarranted burden and unwarranted red tape? This goes back to the worst aspects of issues in this country that treated Aboriginal people as second-class citizens. They are entitled to have a voice in all areas of the Australian community. They are the original inhabitants of this country and they are entitled to have their voice heard. I completely reject the nonsense that we heard from Senator Leyonhjelm about this being unwarranted red tape and a burden on the Productivity Commission. I think the Productivity Commission has been a burden on progress in this country for a period of time—that might be the problem—but you don't solve that by rejecting an Indigenous commissioner in the Productivity Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And Senator Leyonhjelm argued that to keep the banks honest is outrageous—that to demand, through legislation and regulation, that the banks do the right thing by Australians is outrageous. That demonstrates how out of touch Senator Leyonhjelm is about the issues that concern Australians in this country. He talked about ensuring that the banks do the right thing as being 'Soviet-style intervention'. That shows you how out of touch Senator Leyonhjelm is. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  I would like to make a relatively short contribution to this debate. I want to put it on the record that the Australian Greens support the provisions of the bill relating to the Productivity Commission Act 1998—those contained in schedule 2. We strongly support the appointment of another commissioner to the Productivity Commission to oversee its work in relation to the evaluation of policies and programs that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Also, we understand the need for at least one commissioner of the Productivity Commission to have extensive skills and expertise in dealing with policies and programs that impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and to have experience in dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. That is absolutely critical if we are going to address the issues that significantly impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their communities that are the underlying causes of disadvantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were going to indicate our support for the ALP's amendments to change the definition of 'indigenous person'. But, now that the government has brought in their amendment, we will be supporting the government's amendment. We were deeply concerned that we were going with the old race-based definition of 'indigenous person' which was used in section 3 of the bill. We are glad to see that the government is now moving an amendment to at least partly deal with that issue. We do support the three-part definition that is most commonly used now. As I understand it, Aboriginal communities, certainly the ones I have spoken to—and people are probably aware that I have extensive consultation processes with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities—support the three-part definition. That definition involves Aboriginal descent, self-identification as an Aboriginal person and acceptance by the community. We understand that this is the definition that is accepted by the Treasurer's office but not by the Prime Minister's office—that is, that you are accepted as an Indigenous person by the Aboriginal community. That is the definition that I understand the Treasurer's office has been using and, as I said, it is the definition that a lot of Aboriginal organisations and communities use. We are pleased to see that the old definition has been removed, so we will be supporting that amendment. And we would have expressed strong support for the ALP's amendment had there been a need to move that amendment. Having the commissioner with extensive skills and experience in dealing with policies and programs that impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their communities is a really important change and we support that.</span>

I'm not going to dignify that with an answer, but I have to say to you: you should actually try to engage with Indigenous people in this country. You started your parliamentary career attacking Indigenous people, you then moved on to Asians and you then moved on to Islam. You just don't get it, do you? People are entitled to have a life with dignity in this country and not be attacked by people like you. I just want to go on with the issue of indigeneity. I want to ask Senator Cormann a number of questions on that. Senator Cormann, who did you consult with when you came up with the definition of indigeneity?</span>

I'm of the view that, whether or not the minister thinks this is an issue for this bill, it is a fundamental issue for this bill. All I'm asking—and I'm asking politely—is for a sensible response, not for the minister to just stand up and sit down and treat it with disrespect. This is an issue that will come up time and time again when we're dealing with issues that engage Indigenous rights. Why can't the government look at an omnibus bill to solve this problem so we don't have another debate every time there's a bill before—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My focus in evaluating this bill has been on the impact on future prosperity and on fairness for all Australians—in particular, South Australians. I have undertaken an at-length, considered review of materials provided by many sources in relation to this bill, drawing on my business and economics background. I have held numerous meetings and received input from a wide range of stakeholders, including members of the public, South Australian businesses and business groups, leading economists, national welfare groups and national business councils and their members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After undertaking that process, I remain to be convinced that, in isolation from a broader discussion and initiatives on enhancing the overall sustainability of our taxation system, I should support this bill in its current form. I believe this bill is a narrowly cast proposition of change to the overall tax and transfer system, a system which itself continues to be felt by some economists and business leaders to be unsustainable. In the significant reforms posited in the Henry tax review of 2010, the reduction in company tax to 25 per cent was only one of a number of principal feature reforms which have not been acted upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have doubts that the decision to reduce company tax for all companies is prudent to undertake in the face of Australia's budget deficit and debt. Even without this tax cut, I doubt our present tax system is sufficiently robust to support a medium-term fiscal strategy of budget surpluses on average over the course of the economic cycle. Importantly, I see the strength and timing of the effect of this proposed tax cut to be modest relative to its cost. Australia has one of the highest rates of population growth in the developed world, and I am mindful of other uses of government revenue that can generate prosperity and enhance fairness for the Australian people, such as well-targeted social and economic programs aimed at supporting businesses with R&amp;D, innovation and industrial transformation; funding of world-class education and health systems; harnessing the contribution potential of our youth and ageing populations; reducing inequality; and investing in public infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 January 2018, in an opinion piece in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>newspaper, the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities, the Hon. Paul Fletcher, noted that the Commonwealth's share of total public infrastructure spending rising to nearly 30 per cent would see a 0.5 to 0.7 per cent rise in GDP growth and jobs in the fiscal year 2018. He noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Investing in infrastructure results in long-lived assets which deliver benefits to the community for many decades—but it also stimulates economic growth as the investment occurs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as stated before, I remain to be convinced that I should support this bill in its current form, in isolation from a broader discussion and initiatives on enhancing the overall sustainability of our taxation system and with alternative uses of government revenue that can generate prosperity and enhance fairness for the Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231199" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I rise today to share the incredible story of Greg Ryan and I'd like to acknowledge Greg's presence in the gallery today. Greg's is a story of determination, struggle and ultimately acceptance and international advocacy. Immediately after birth, some 54 years ago, Greg was unusually short of breath. His doctors conducted a more thorough examination and discovered that he did not have an anal opening due to the congenital condition imperforated anus, or IA for short. His parents were advised that they should arrange for a baptism as soon as possible and there was no certainty he would survive the day. Greg was baptised an hour after birth, placed in a humidicrib and rushed in the back of his father's Volkswagen across town to the Royal Children's Hospital, where Greg was quickly admitted. After life-saving surgery was performed within 24 hours, for the next 50 years, Greg told no-one of his IA except for his parents and medical professionals—not his wife, not his brother and not his friends or colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, four years ago, Greg returned from a short holiday. He only lasted three days on that holiday before suffering a serious mental breakdown. In his words, he returned in disarray both physically and mentally and, for the next few months, lived in torpor, despair and isolation, regularly mutilating himself and searching for a pathway out. Somewhere in the haze, he recalls searching 'imperforate anus' on Facebook, hoping for a support group for people with the condition. Greg found three groups and, soon after introducing himself, was contacted by a young woman who also lives in Melbourne, who is the mother of a young man with IA. Greg was invited to meet up at the Melbourne zoo with four mothers and their children, some with IA. Greg was apprehensive but also excited on arrival. He had never met anyone else with IA. For the first hour, they strolled through the zoo and chatted casually but awkwardly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over lunch, the inevitable conversation began. Greg recalls that one of the mums described the history of her then seven-year-old son and how he required daily enemas. Greg writes that he was overcome with emotion. As he watched this wonderful child enjoy the company of his peers, he saw himself. He says he had to do everything in his power not to burst into tears. Soon after, he began talking to one of the other mothers, Christi. Greg asked Christi how her daughter was, enquiring if she had to endure the daily, debilitating treatment Greg so remembered from his childhood. Christi responded: 'It's not my daughter, Greg; I am the one who has IA.' Greg was speechless. He said tears ran down his face. It was the first time either Greg or Christi had met another adult with IA. They had both lived a lifetime believing they were the only person in the world with this condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From that chance inquiry on Facebook, Greg then met people from around the world. He had a support network. He became a key in the worldwide IA support network. He became the voice of thousands of children around the world, to assist their parents, their carers and doctors understand the whole experience of a child with IA. Over time, Greg saw the need to take further control of his life. He created a Facebook group for adults living with imperforate anus. This secret group allowed adults a private space to discuss issues in an open and supportive environment. The Facebook network led Greg to the Pull-Thru Network in America and to Orlando, Florida, where he attended a conference which changed his life—not medically, but mentally. It created a sense of determination to let people know about IA and to share the patient experience with doctors and surgeons who saw the physical conditions as medical problems to solve but hadn't adequately considered the whole person—the mental trauma of daily life with IA, the enemas, the leakage, the hundreds of days in hospital, the fear of breakdowns and the complete lack of support from teenage years to adulthood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Greg just weeks ago, after I was invited to join the advisory committee of his new charity, the ONE in 5000 Foundation. ONE in 5000 was formally established late last year to advocate for Australians with anorectal malformation, which is the other name for IA. The foundation's name is derived from the fact that one in 5,000 people are born with some form of IA. Greg has written a book, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Secret Life: Surviving A Rare Congenital Condition</span>. It's a fabulous read. The book is the first of its kind on the patient's experience of IA. Greg gave me a copy of the book and I simply couldn't put it down. I'm not a big reader, but I read it within about a day and a half, in between flights and the whole range of things. It's probably one of the most frank, honest and enlightened stories of someone's life that I have ever read. Greg honestly shows the courage he has as a human being, sharing the most personal aspects of his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greg has tried to lead and has succeeded in leading a reasonably normal life, including things like playing sport, holding down jobs and getting married, but he has encountered many barriers while living everyday life. He brutally outlines how, while he could often deal with the challenges, on a small number of occasions things simply just got too much. In the book and over dinner, Greg honestly shared the struggles he has had with depression and that, on at least four occasions, he has suffered serious mental breakdowns. Sitting at the table in an Italian restaurant in Fitzroy eating dinner with Greg and my good friend Les Cameron was as normal as anyone could imagine. The other diners would not have been aware of the story that I was hearing; neither would they have been aware of the traumas that Greg had experienced during his life. We looked like any other three people out having dinner, talking, laughing and enjoying themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must congratulate Les for his advocacy of and support for Greg. Eight years ago, after a serious mental breakdown, Greg could work no more. His psychiatrist and GP recommended that he apply for the disability support pension. Remarkably, Greg's first application was knocked back, despite strong evidence from his medical professionals that he was not able to work. Greg decided to appeal, and Les accompanied him to the appeal meetings and acted as his advocate through the process. The decision was not the fault of Centrelink; it was due to the culture and framework of a broken institution, an institution that must be reformed to be a vital support service for our most vulnerable people. Greg finally secured access to the DSP, after strong advocacy from himself, Les and his psychiatrist, an effort which placed an unnecessary and cruel burden on Greg. Les also supported Greg in writing the book and establishing the ONE in 5000 Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ONE in 5000 Foundation has a clear vision that within five years we will ensure that every child born with IA or ARM in Australia, and possibly across the world, is guaranteed to be born into a community that is aware of IA and the need for human support for each child; that has parental access to comprehensive online information, linked to age and nature of the condition; and that has first-rate surgical and clinical care from a well-coordinated set of medical practitioners, from GPs through to highly trained colorectal specialists, from paediatric to adult care. This vision includes the need for a world-class centre for paediatric colorectal and pelvic conditions at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, led by Associate Professor Sebastian King. I know that Greg has an ongoing caring relationship with Professor King. He spoke very fondly of him during the dinner that we had in Fitzroy that night. Such a centre should include, on staff, a specialist colorectal nurse coordinator, a stomal therapist and a continence nurse, as well as a part-time social worker and a psychologist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final aim of ONE in 5000 is comprehensive support for children, parents and family that is the equivalent of that for any other congenital condition. This support would include a world's best-practice peer group support program, with training for IA and ARM community members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank Greg for his advocacy, and I want to thank him sincerely for travelling up here today. It's a massive thing to come to Canberra to listen to someone deliver a 10-minute speech. Thank you, Greg. Thank you for your advocacy and for your passion. I urge everyone to read <span style="font-style:italic;">A Secret Life</span>. I know we're not allowed to have props, but I have the book here; it is the most fantastic read. Learn more about IA, ARM and the ONE in 5000 Foundation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  Last week the United Nations Human Rights Council passed five resolutions against state actions in territories occupied by Israel. All five resolutions passed. The question then becomes: how did Australia vote? Australia and the United States are notable exceptions in being the only two countries which voted against each resolution. Australia voted against condemning the continued expansion of the Israeli illegal settlements. Australia voted against demanding an end to Israel's human rights abuses against Palestinians. Australia voted against the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Australia voted against the call for an embargo against the arms trade with Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems the Australian government has forgotten that we are a signatory to the binding Arms Trade Treaty that clearly states that a state should deny any export authorisation for arms trade that will be used in the act of breaching the 1949 Geneva conventions, directed against civilian objects or civilians protected as such or used in other war crimes as defined by international agreements. We are a member of the ATT, yet Australia supports our industries to enter into contracts with Israeli arms manufacturers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year it was discovered that Bisalloy Steels in the Illawarra entered into a trade contract with Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The discovery was quickly followed by a campaign organised by students and locals in the Illawarra on the South Coast of New South Wales, including the local Greens, calling on Bisalloy to reconsider the contract. That was quickly followed by a campaign by supporters of Bisalloy to discredit local organisers and the Greens with misinformation and unfounded condemnation by uncritical supporters of Israel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Presumably trying to distance itself from accusations of war profiteering, Bisalloy did release a statement that the steel contracted for supply will only be—and these are their words—'used in applications that provide protection for people, property and valuables'. However, Rafael also announced that the steel supplied by Bisalloy will be used in their armoured fighting vehicles. Images of these armoured fighting vehicles clearly show that they are not designed to protect; they are designed to destroy. Bisalloy's steel might not be going to the production of bullets or bombs, but there is no doubt that these vehicles that will be made with Bisalloy Australian steel are weapons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget that there is strong evidence that Israeli armoured forces do commit war crimes and violate human rights. Numerous United Nations inquiries and investigators have raised those concerns, but, with the repeated complaint of being singled out by the UN and the unwavering support of the US, the Israeli government manages to avoid any serious scrutiny. The US has Israel's back, and it now appears that Australia does as well. Against Australia's international obligations and against the wishes of the majority of Australian people who rightly condemn the persecution of Palestinians living under Israel's oppressive control, the Australian government continues to stand on the wrong side of history and against humanity on this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I touched on the company in the Illawarra. It's worth remembering the progressive history of this issue, particularly when it comes to standing up for people who are under the threat of war. The Illawarra has a proud tradition in this country of leading the charge in the struggle for peace. From the days of Pig Iron Bob, when wharfies refused to load scrap iron destined for Japan, which was at that time aggressively bombing China, through to being amongst the first in Australia to protest against apartheid in South Africa, the people of the Illawarra have stood up time and time again for humanity and for a peaceful world. I do believe that the work many of them are now doing in relation to the Bisalloy company right in their midst is in keeping with this tradition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens certainly acknowledge the need for there to be an expansion of the manufacturing industry. But we need a manufacturing industry that is looking to a peaceful world—a world where we can deal with environmental challenges, reduce inequality and ensure that there are jobs, particularly in regional areas, and not go down this path of relying on a war manufacturing industry. This tradition, which has been so rich in Israel, is something the campaign against Bisalloy manufacturing is working to address by taking on what Bisalloy Steels and Rafael are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have always supported and will continue to support our local manufacturing industries. Australia needs to protect its onshore manufacturing capacity and capabilities, and Australian workers in all regions depend on the government to continue to develop our industries so that they may participate in the local, national and global market. But, again, that needs to be in the conduct of a peaceful world without Australia going down the very dangerous and irresponsible path of contributing to arms manufacturing and war situations in other countries. But our support should not extend to manufacturing used to profit from the ugly practice of war, particularly when it is destined for use by the government of a country that has been in, and continues to be in, violation of numerous UN resolutions and humanitarian laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contract between Bisalloy and Rafael implicates Australia as an active agent in the Israeli government's violation of international laws and potentially as a facilitator of war crimes. The Greens believe Australia needs to end military ties with Israel, not strengthen them. That's a policy of the Greens, and we're pleased to be supporting the action around the Illawarra, which is part of how that need for action for peace in all parts of our world plays out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our manufacturing plants and our workers should not and must not partake in the market of profiteering from violence, death and destruction. The contract between Bisalloy and Rafael does not strengthen Australia's position in the global marketplace. It strengthens the grip of war and violence—which, sadly, is extending to more countries—and the grip of war and violence on Palestinians. We do support the campaigners who are being attacked through a series of lies and misinformation as they stand against Australian companies producing and selling parts of weapons of war, and against turning the Illawarra into a place in Australia where arms manufacturing and military base operations will be developed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being against war and violence is not radical. It's not something that people should be attacked over. It's something that they should be congratulated for; that they're working to build a more peaceful and more respectful society. It's certainly not a consequence of having a bleeding heart. Being against war, violence, destruction and large-scale suffering is surely what humanity should be about.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  On 12 March, I had the great pleasure to be part of the official naming ceremony for the new national office building for the Department of Social Services here in Canberra. I was there with the Minister for Social Services, Dan Tehan; the Assistant Minister for Children and Families, David Gillespie; and the Secretary of the DSS, Kathryn Campbell, as well as many employees of the department and representatives of Cromwell, the building owner, Paul Weightman and Bobby Binning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brand new building provided a fantastic opportunity to recognise a remarkable Australian: Dame Enid Lyons. Dame Enid Lyons was elected to parliament in 1943 and was the first woman to sit in the House of Representatives, as the member for Darwin—which is now the electorate of Braddon in Tasmania. In 1949, when Robert Menzies became Prime Minister, Enid Lyons became the first woman to sit in the federal cabinet. She was also the wife of Joseph Lyons, the Premier of Tasmania from 1923 to 1928 and Prime Minister of Australia from 1932 to 1939, when he died. They had 12 children together—and, in fact, a number of the descendants of Dame Enid Lyons and Joe Lyons were in attendance on this very special occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dame Enid Lyons's enduring legacy and passionate advocacy for reforms to welfare, in particular to support women and children, have made a considerable impact on Australian society. She was a great Liberal success story and someone we should be very, very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a long history when it comes to this building, first as a senator for the ACT and then as the former Assistant Minister for Social Services. When the last lease for the DSS headquarters was up, I fought very hard to keep local jobs in the Tuggeranong Town Centre. This new building not only kept a significant workforce in Tuggeranong—over 2,000 staff—which helps keep small businesses in the area viable, but also attracted significant investment and new jobs for the new building. The building received $26.8 million funding from the Commonwealth for the fit-out costs, in addition to the $130 million build from Cromwell. I was there for the turning of the sod when construction of the new building began. I was there for the opening last year to officially conduct that ceremony, and I spoke in this chamber about the building when it opened. And it was an honour to be part of the naming last week. It's a great facility for local Canberra workers and a great opportunity to honour a woman who has left such a vital legacy to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 15 March, I also had the fantastic opportunity to visit IP Australia at their Woden offices, here in Canberra, and take part in their lunch for the World's Greatest Shave for the Leukaemia Foundation. This was an opportunity to visit IP Australia as Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation, but it was also great to help them raise money and support such an important cause. The World's Greatest Shave provides a great opportunity for businesses, schools and community organisations to raise money for the Leukaemia Foundation. Many of us have been personally touched by cancer or have had a family or friend impacted. Blood cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in Australia. It claims more lives than breast cancer or melanoma. Every day, another 35 people will be diagnosed. It's with the continued support of organisations across Australia that initiatives like the World's Greatest Shave are able to provide much-needed funds to both support families and continue research into prevention methods and, maybe one day, a cure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wasn't the one getting my head shaved on the day. That honour went to the very brave Sue Pedder, who had the courage to let me do the first cut with the scissors. Another of her IP Australia colleagues, Lucinda Rowles, also had her head shaved but at a separate event. I'd like to congratulate both Sue and Lucinda on taking up the cause. It's an admirable thing to do—something so personal for an important cause—especially going into a Canberra winter. The funds they raised will go some way to helping those who are even braver and have an even bigger fight as they confront a diagnosis of leukaemia. I'd also like to congratulate all of the IP Australia staff, who do such a good job in protecting intellectual property in Australia. It's such an important thing, and many of them do it right here in Canberra. I'm very proud of the work that they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had another great opportunity to officially launch the Melanoma March on the 18th of this month. The Melanoma Institute Australia is the world's largest centre focused specifically on melanoma treatment, prevention and cure. In relative terms, Australia has pretty good cancer survival rates, but of course we need to do much better. While medical research and better screening, diagnosis and treatment are vital in the fight against cancer, it's important to remember that most cancers, and melanoma especially, are largely preventable. Prevention, early diagnosis and effective treatment mean that no-one should have to die from melanoma. Australia and New Zealand unfortunately have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. Melanoma is the most common cancer in young Australians, making up approximately 20 per cent of cases, and melanoma kills more young Australians than any other cancer. One person every six hours will die from melanoma in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not all doom and gloom. Over the past five years, the use of improved treatments has tripled life expectancy for people with melanoma so that is good news. The government is investing heavily in cancer research. Over the past five years, under the coalition government, around $4.8 billion worth of medicines have been added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for cancer treatment. The government's National Health and Medical Research Council has provided nearly $140 million since the year 2000 for research into melanoma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is always more that we can do. That's why I'm proud to have participated in this necessary and crucial march. I want to thank all of those hardworking volunteers here in Canberra and around the country who have helped to put together these marches. It was a largely thankless task, but I want to thank them for their hard work on what is a really important cause. And I encourage those listening to get checked by their GP and specialist skin clinics. If you get in front of melanoma, it is very survivable. We want to see survival rates continue to improve significantly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to take the chance to congratulate some local Canberrans who have celebrated significant birthdays and anniversaries. One of the great pleasures of being a local senator is that I can facilitate letters from the Prime Minister, the Governor-General and sometimes the Queen to help people celebrate these wonderful occasions. I congratulate Joan Faulkner, from Evatt, who celebrated her 90th birthday on 28 February; Stavroula Tzakis, from Page, who celebrated her 100th birthday on 6 March; Heather McGlew, from Farrer, who celebrated her 90th birthday on 13 March; Roger and Barber Ashworth, from Wanniassa, who celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on 23 March, a wonderful achievement; Ronald Francis, from Kingston, who celebrated his 90th birthday on 24 March; and Doreen Johns, from Garran, who will celebrate her 90th birthday on 29 March. Happy birthday for tomorrow, Doreen. It's a wonderful thing to honour those people, who have lived such long lives and made such wonderful contributions to our community, and to celebrate 50 years of marriage. What a great legacy that is. I congratulate them all.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  Today I get up to state the case for early childhood educators across Australia, 6,500 of whom walked off the job yesterday to further demonstrate to the Turnbull government that the time to pay a professional wage is long overdue. But let me put into perspective what we are talking about here. There are more than 100,000 educators working in early childhood services across this country—108,000, to be exact. They work in long day care, educating almost 700,000 Australian children—from birth right through to five and six years of age—across 7,000 centres in Australia. Ninety-six per cent of that workforce is female and 70 per cent of those educators have their wages set by awards. And we know that awards in this country represent minimum rates of pay. Looking at the rest of Australia's workforce, 70 per cent of early childhood educators have their wages set by awards in this country compared to 20 per cent of workers in the rest of the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Educators are qualified—from certificate III right through to early childhood teacher, Masters and PhD—and those qualifications take anywhere from 18 months to four years to achieve. Yet that sector is absolutely defined by poverty wages. If you have a certificate III and you are an educator working in early childhood education in Australia, you are likely to be paid about $22 an hour. For people listening to this and watching, a certificate III is the equivalent of a tradesperson. You show me any tradesperson who is paid as little as $22 an hour! There is no trade that is equal to that low rate of pay. An educator is someone who has done three or four years at university—and has paid HECS fees and so on—and they are on about $26 an hour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Educators have been fighting for fair wages for the last 20 years in this sector, possibly longer than that. Their union, United Voice, has taken cases to every state jurisdiction in this country, and, indeed, the federal jurisdiction. Just a couple of weeks ago, after a four-year struggle costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, the Fair Work Commission saw fit to throw a case out. Those educators got a zero wage increase. I've stood here, since being elected, and I've heard the Turnbull government tell us that they don't set the wages and that the place to go to get wage justice is the Fair Work Commission. Well, the union has done that right across this country, in every state and in the federal jurisdiction, only to be told a couple of weeks ago, 'No, you're going to remain on those low rates of pay.' In fact, the Fair Work Commission didn't even talk to any early childhood educators. We know those rules are broken and there is need for change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alongside this, we know through academic study and research that early brain development for children between the ages of nought and three years is critical. That's when our brains develop the most and the fastest, and yet we've got a government who turns a blind eye to this. Indeed, I was gobsmacked earlier in the week to hear the government say the union, United Voice—my union—was somehow manipulating these workers. For any of the Liberals who get to meet with these educators in the halls today—indeed, some of them are up in the gallery now—they will see that these are feisty women who are proud of their profession and who want to stay in their profession. We know, through research that's been done at universities, that the only way that the women you see up in the gallery—who are directors of centres, who have certificate IIIs and who are teachers—can stay in the sector is either if their family supports them or if they've got a partner who earns a lot more money so that they can continue in the profession that they love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The low wages in the sector are forcing hundreds of educators to leave the sector each week. That's a cost to Australia. That's a loss to the service where those educators have built up a bond with the children they are educating and with the parents who entrust the most vulnerable in their family to those educators to care for and to educate them every day of the week. It's a loss to those families and those children, but it's also a loss to us as a community. It's a cost to us, as a community, to keep retraining educators to go back into the sector. All we really need to do is sit down and work this out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard the government say, 'We don't employ educators.' All of that is a rubbish argument, because the reality is that this sector is 100 per cent funded by the federal government. Most of the funds, unfortunately, go to parents in the form of fee relief, but it is now time—it is long overdue—to treat these women with justice and respect and to recognise that they are professionals. It's time for the Turnbull government to sit down and say, 'We've got a problem—wages are too low and there's a massive turnover in the sector—and we really need to look at this problem.' The Turnbull government can't say any more, 'Go to the Fair Work Commission,' because the union tried that and they got zero. The Fair Work commissioners didn't even bother to speak to educators about the amazing work the educators do. They program—children in services have individual programs. Who does that? The women you see up there do that. They do that for $22 an hour. They do that on poverty wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was at United Voice, the amazing early educators that I met and still have contact with can't really afford to stay in the sector. They certainly can't afford to buy homes. They certainly can't afford to buy new clothes. They certainly don't buy new cars. The contribution that they are making to our communities, and, indeed, to Australia's future, is overwhelming, and yet they continue to be underpaid and under-recognised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That has to stop. Why do we suddenly recognise what happens at the age of six in schools but turn a blind eye to what is happening between the ages of zero and six and particularly between the ages of zero and three, when children's brains are developing more than they ever will for the rest of their lives?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the services that I have been to, I have seen quality programs. I have seen children being given amazing opportunities, with first-class learning and education going on. And, yet, we continue to ignore the plight of educators. We continue to say, 'It's someone else's problem that you are earning $22 an hour.' But it isn't. It is not someone else's problem. The problem rests with the federal government. It is time that the federal government sat down with the union, instead of saying the union is somehow manipulating these women. If those of you across the chamber, in your heart of hearts, think that, meet with these women. They are here today. You can have a chat to them and you will see they are not manipulated by anyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are women who do an incredible job every day of the week with Australia's most vulnerable children, particularly those children between the ages of zero and three but up to six, and they deserve recognition. They deserve to be treated as professionals. I have met a number of women within the sector who have master's degrees, PhDs and teaching qualifications, and yet we continue to turn a blind eye to that. They are here today. You will see them in the corridors. Their campaign is called Big Steps, they are members of United Voice, they are not manipulated by anyone and they are here to ask the Turnbull government for decent pay, for professional wages, because they are professionals. They are professionals looking after the most vulnerable in our community, and it is long overdue that they got wage justice. That can only be provided by the Turnbull government. If the Turnbull government refuses to do that then we will make sure that the Labor government does, because they deserve professional wages.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:27</span>):  This parliament is full of OPM addicts. Addiction to OPM is a national crisis, and I am surrounded by addicts. I am not talking about the drug opium but something far more terrible. I am talking about an addiction to other people's money. In the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Other People's Money</span>, the character played by Danny DeVito makes the following reflection:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I love money. I love money more than I love the things it can buy. Does that surprise you? Money, it don't care whether I'm good or not. It don't care whether I snore or not. It don't care which god I pray to. There are only three things in this world with that kind of unconditional acceptance: dogs, doughnuts and money. Only money is better. You know why? Because it don't make you fat and it don't poop all over the living room floor. There's only one thing I like better. Other people's money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a lot of people like that in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great economist Milton Friedman taught us that there are four ways to spend money: spending your own money on yourself, spending your own money on somebody else, spending other people's money on yourself and spending other people's money on somebody else. When you spend your own money on yourself, there is a strong incentive to spend wisely. Nobody spends money more carefully than its owner. This is why it is more efficient as well as right for people to be allowed to keep their own money. When you spend your own money on someone else, you will still be motivated to economise but will be somewhat less likely to satisfy the needs of the other person. Anyone who has given or received an unwanted gift will understand this concept. Even with the best of intentions, spending your money on someone else doesn't always work out for the best. When you spend other people's money on yourself, you have no strong incentive to keep down the cost but at least you have a strong desire to fulfil your own needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is an even more wasteful type of spending. This is spending other people's money on other people. In this scenario, you care little about both value for money and meeting the needs of the people on whom you are spending the money. Spending other people's money on other people is what we do here. It is the worst kind of expenditure. It explains why so much public money is wasted. It is an inevitable characteristic of OPM that so many grand government plans are destined for failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we can do something about our addiction to OPM, we first must acknowledge our problem. What we need is OPM Addicts Anonymous. Many government programs are not created because people demand them or because the market was unable to provide the services but because politicians have bought favour with OPM. Politicians are addicted to OPM because they use it to expand their influence, reward political cronies and keep their constituencies dependent on them. I have heard quite a few in this place describe how well they can spend other people's money—indeed, that they can spend it better than anyone else; so well, in fact, that some people should hand over more of their money for them to spend. But if I asked everybody in this chamber to turn out their wallets and purses and give me a sizeable chunk of the money in their possession—say, a quarter or a third—I imagine there would be some disquiet. If I were to tell you that the reason for taking your money is that I know better than you what should be done with it, there might even be some resentment. If I told you that the fact that I was allowing you to keep some of your money was a concession and that it was a cost to me because it prevented me from spending it so well, you might even think I was nuts. And, finally, if I explained to you that, if you refused to give me the money, you could go to jail, I expect that you would even get angry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, imagine that I decided that the last pot of cash you were forced to give me was not nearly enough so I borrowed some more, with the interest to be paid out of what you paid me and the debt to be left hanging over you and your children. Then imagine I started spending it foolishly on things you didn't want. It would be natural to feel outraged. In fact, you should feel outraged. It's something most of us would recognise as common theft. Not only that; it would also constitute authoritarian, incompetent, irrational, vain, patronising and delusional behaviour on my part. But all of that is exactly what the Australian government does to the Australian public, no matter who sits on which side of the chamber. Many people would call it stealing, but in this place we call it 'just another day at the office'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest problems with OPM is that we either overlook or don't truly appreciate its cost. Oscar Wilde once described a cynic as someone who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing. But there is a far more dangerous type of person in this place: the dreamer—someone who values everything but understands nothing about the cost. We've seen heartfelt and teary-eyed declarations for increased pensions, Newstart, welfare eligibility, services for veterans, a national disability scheme, Gonski school funding, early childhood learning and medical research. All of these things sound great in principle, but the reality of OPM is that money spent on these things is likely to be spent recklessly, in ways that people would not spend themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps what we need before agreeing to each proposal to spend OPM is an explanation as to why the money should not be left with its owner to be spent by them. Can we put our hand on our heart and swear that we, and the bureaucrats who implement the policies we approve, won't do a worse job of spending it? Can we really say that all the OPM we spend on children—from child care, all the way through schooling and into tertiary education—much of it taken from people who don't have children, is really better spent than if it were spent by their parents? Can we really say that the battlers in Western Sydney and Melbourne aren't better off giving themselves a holiday, paying off a chunk of their mortgage or buying themselves a better car by using their own money instead of giving it to the government?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politicians pretending to be compassionate when all they are doing is handing out other people's money are just thieves masquerading as angels. Far too much of our political debate is restricted to the question of how to spend OPM, or, if you like: who is the better dealer in OPM? This is the wrong question to ask, because, as Milton Friedman taught us, it is the very nature of the spending that is the problem. A much better question to ask is: why don't we just let people spend more of their own money?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  As I've reflected on many times in this place, Western Australia is no stranger to pioneering new, globally competitive and commercially successful industries. You just have to look at our resource and agricultural sectors, and now our rapidly developing defence and space industries. So today I rise to speak about another exciting opportunity for Western Australia: to make our great state a global hub for lithium mining and production and also technological development. With some planning and coordination, Western Australia can become the world's new Silicon Valley—or, in this case, 'lithium valley'—right from mining the raw ore through to the development of new applications for industries, such as the aerospace and energy storage sectors. As a state, we now need to believe we can work together to make this a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report prepared for the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, AMEC, on the lithium industry, which came out last year, breaks down the five key processes of value chain production. For battery production, it is mining, refining, electroprocessing, cell production and assembly. It's no secret at all that, in Western Australia and Australia, we've always been world leaders in extracting and exporting our natural resources—in this case, minerals. But we now have the, probably unprecedented, opportunity to grow a new industry: to process and manufacture raw lithium into new products and even into new technologies. There are particularly exciting opportunities now in the energy generation and storage industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the first part of this value chain production, in this case, the mining of the ore, Australia represents 51 per cent of the global value share—51 per cent of the value of lithium mined globally. Our closest competitors for this first stage of the value chain processing are Chile, at 29 per cent; Argentina, at 14 per cent; and China, at five per cent. Despite this commanding lead in the mining of lithium, we then slip off the measurable index when it comes to the next four stages in the value chain. Today, China is the largest global player in refining, electroprocessing and cell production, and Japan is the largest in assembly. But I firmly and very passionately believe it is time for that to change. We have the lithium, we have the technology and we also have the workforce to make that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I had the honour of visiting the Pacific Industrial Company. They are building plant infrastructure for Tianqi Lithium—a record $700 million investment in Kwinana, just south of Perth. The fact that $700 million is being invested into this facility I think is a very clear demonstration that we can do far more than simply mine the resource. We can also value-add through refining, which is what this facility is designed to do. The first, $400-million stage of this massive operation will produce 60 per cent of the globe's lithium supply when it's completed. In fact, the demand is increasing so rapidly that, even before phase 1 is finished, they are adding a second, $300-million plant to increase production to 120 per cent of the current world demand. But we know that, by the time both of these facilities have been completed, the demand will have risen globally by that much. So this facility signals that Australia has actually entered into the second phase—that is, the refining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To get a better sense of the scale and pace of demand in this industry, you just need to have a look at the decisions of global car manufacturers to increase their production of electric vehicles. Volvo, Nissan, Ford, Volkswagen, Mercedes and many others predict that electric vehicle sales will make up double digits of their market share in the very early 2020s. But it's not just in the motor vehicle industry that lithium is used. It's also used in many other industries, including aircraft components and anywhere there is a weight-sensitive requirement for energy storage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is very well placed to develop as a competitive player through the remainder of the value chain, particularly taking into account the abundance of lithium—and not just lithium but also many other minerals required for some of these new technologies. For example, we also have copper, nickel, cobalt and aluminium, which places us in the box seat to take advantage of these emerging technologies. What does that actually mean for Western Australia and also Australia? Western Australia could quite rapidly dominate the global supply of lithium batteries, the development of new applications for these minerals and new technologies development, creating decades of new jobs within Western Australia and a new skill base for people in Western Australia across adjacent industries. Australia, and Western Australia in particular, clearly has the capacity to become a global player in these direct battery inputs, with the additional benefits directly supporting energy storage and innovation in both industry and academia. But, like the creation of any new industry, it won't just happen. The global 'lithium valley' that I envisage can and should be developed. As I said, it can be done using existing Western Australian resources, our smarts and the technologically capabilities that we have within our state. We now have to have the confidence and a shared vision to implement this new industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What will it actually take? I've had a look at overseas experience and some of the factors of success across value chain production. We'd need to leverage across one of five key areas. First of all, you need the political and economic desire to generate more value and more employment in country. Clearly we already have that in Australia, and we particularly have that in Western Australia. We also need the political, economic and academic desire to develop in-country research and development of these new technologies. We clearly have that. We also need the economic and political desire and belief that we can support downstream emerging industries in our country—that we don't have to dig it out of the ground and send it elsewhere to value-add anymore. There are, of course, economic balance of trade considerations and trade security through access to a broader range of existing and new customers. Clearly, in Western Australia, we have many of these preconditions, but we do now need to raise awareness and increase confidence within our own state and country that it can happen. In fact, as I've said, $700 million is being invested in two new refinery and production processes in Western Australia. Now we have to work together to make the rest of it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Lithium report</span>, released last year, made a number of very sensible recommendations on how we can work together across the three levels of government to implement this. The first set of recommendations speak about raising awareness of Australia's lithium opportunities and ensuring the development of this industry along with adjacent industries as a priority for the federal government. The second set of recommendations are about ensuring that the federal government and state governments get the policy settings right. These include state governments looking at new state agreements, streamlining approval processes across a range of agencies to attract new investment and reviewing industry concessions. For the Commonwealth government, the report recommended the funding and facilitation of enabling infrastructure and research through organisations such as the CSIRO, the NAIF and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other nations are not blind to the opportunities in the lithium industry and other associated metals and are rapidly developing the industrial capability to capture a share of this growing market. This is something that we still have an advantage in delivering, but we haven't got a lot of time if we are going to take the production, the refinery, of our own metals into the 21st century. Western Australia has always been at its best when our state and federal government representatives work together with industry to develop new opportunities. We did that 50 years ago with the iron ore industry, and I believe it is time to once again do it, so that Western Australia can become the new 'lithium valley'. The future is very bright indeed for this new industry.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Nearly 12 months ago, in Alice Springs, more than 300 people marched in solidarity with local Aboriginal women who are striving to make their communities safer places for children and families. The action was initiated by a group of Aboriginal women from town camps in Alice Springs—the Tangentyere Women's Family Safety Group. In Arrernte, 'tangentyere' means 'coming together'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tangentyere Women's Family Safety Group formally began only a few years ago, in 2015, to train Aboriginal women living in the town camps of Alice Springs to identify family violence and its risks and triggers. Since that time, the women have gone from strength to strength. To date, they have trained 165 women in Alice Springs, including 25 women in one town camp where there are only five houses. Think about that: 25 women in one town camp where there are only five houses. Do the maths on that. It goes to show that the issue of housing and overcrowding is very real and a very real challenge for the Tangentyere women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The women have developed a range of culturally appropriate resources to educate and inform women and organisations, they've advocated and lobbied about family and domestic violence issues in the Northern Territory, and they have taken a stand against violence in their communities. They have stood up and said: 'Enough. This is not good enough.' Most importantly, they have developed their own solutions for their own communities, and they are making an enormous difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The women from the Tangentyere Women's Family Safety Group were tired of being overlooked and not being heard, especially by the wider community, on issues such as family and domestic violence. They have been doing something about it, and they are continuing to do something about it. Since the success and support they received from that march in Alice Springs last year, they have been planning to bring their message directly to Canberra, to make sure that we, the political leaders in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, listen to their stories and, most importantly, their solutions, and that we learn from them and also support their work. After a year of fundraising, specifically for this journey to Canberra, that's what they've done: 11 women from the town camps of Alice Springs travelled to Canberra so that Canberra could take notice of them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all those who asked how these women got to Canberra, and to all those who could only criticise and ask where this money was coming from to get these women to Canberra, let me repeat for you: the women funded themselves. They believed in themselves and their families, and, over the last 12 months, they raised their own funds for the trip to Canberra. They came here together and travelled together, to ask us to listen to a wide range of Aboriginal voices, regarding family safety and domestic violence. They asked us to commit to genuine collaboration and partnerships when governments are developing policies around domestic violence. They told us clearly that Aboriginal, community based organisations need long-term, secure investment in grassroots programs. They told us Aboriginal people have family and domestic violence solutions. They have the solutions, and they must be a part of the decision-making process. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to this Senate and to the members of the House of Representatives: I hope we heard them and I hope we continue to hear them. I hope Australia hears them. I hope we have seen the heartache that family violence has caused these women and their families. Why do I hope that? Because it may touch your heart when you sit down to make decisions on policies that impact First Nations people. I hope we have understood these mothers, grandmothers, sisters and aunties and how they care deeply and are so totally committed to the safety of their families. In the words of group member Marlene Hayes: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm doing it for my daughter, and I'm doing it for my grandmothers, my mothers, my aunties, and I also will be reflecting on two of my aunties who are not here today, and I'm in doing it in honour of those two ladies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">All us women, we've been victims. The violence always goes into the homes and it starts off with racism and arguing and then a fight starts and it's got to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="&#xD;&#xA;        margin-bottom:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;      direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It put a tear in my eyes that we're talking to the Government, and teaching them that we've got feelings too, us women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These women were empowered by this visit. They laid their flowers in the courtyard. I take a moment to digress and thank very much our gardeners at Parliament House for their leniency as the women held sorry camp on the lawns here at Parliament House in memory of the many women they have lost through domestic violence. As the coordinator of the program, Shirleen Campbell, said, these women are not just statistics; they are real people, and they're tired of being held accountable for the criminal actions of individual members of their wider community. These women said clearly that they were here representing the women and girls in the town camps of Alice Springs. There are 16 town camps around Alice Springs, and these women would not presume to speak for other people or any other community. But they are the leaders and voices of their communities in these town camps in Alice Springs, and they are speaking to all Australians. Their voice matters, and so do their stories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be listening, as they said, to a wide range of Aboriginal voices regarding family and domestic violence issues. Every community should have a voice and has a right to be heard. We have First Nations women who are always talking to one another about the impacts of violence. I only need to reflect on my own family situation, with my families in the gulf region—the Yanyuwa, the Garrwa, the Mara and the Kudanji peoples. We talk a lot about the violence that impacts our families. My aunties, my sisters, my grandmothers—we talk. Sometimes our voices can be loud and strong, and other times our voices still need encouragement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Tangentyere women told us, 'Listen to us, stand with us and support us.' I say to the Senate and the House of Representatives, to parliamentarians, to the media, to all listening to this: we have to listen to these women if we want to believe in building a better Australia. We must do it while strengthening culture and family connections. If we are to change anything, power and decision making must be returned to Aboriginal people at the grassroots. There are so many critics and there are so many arguments against the reasons for empowering First Nations people. A lot of that centres around confusion—the myth, the mistake, of believing that culture is a problem. Culture is not the problem. It's the systemic issues of the Westminster system, which still fails to grapple with the enormity of respecting First Nations people, fails to include First Nations people, fails to empower First Nations people to rise above the poverty and the endless cycle of disadvantage. No-one wants to see this breakthrough more than the First Nations people. Tangentyere is an example of this—an organisation that is controlled and run by the town campers of Alice Springs. I urge you, senators, if you're visiting Alice Springs: take the time, pick up the phone and visit the women of Tangentyere.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I rise today to make a contribution in support of the manuka honey industry in Australia, particularly in my home state of Tasmania. Canberrans are used to pronouncing manuka differently than we do back home in Tasmania. The name manuka goes back a long way in my home state of Tassie. In fact, the leptospermum plants from which the manuka honey derives were first recorded in Tasmania back in the 1880s and the first manuka honey was recorded as being produced in South Australia from plants deriving from Tasmania in the 1830s. It was with some pleasure that I, along with my Tasmanian colleague Senator Bushby and the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Mr Littleproud, was able to announce $165,000 for the Australian Manuka Honey Association—funded under the Agricultural Trade and Market Access Cooperation program—to assist and support the Australian Manuka Honey Association in addressing some emerging issues in international markets and to share manuka honey production methods overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very important time in history for the Australian industry, particularly given attempts by our friends across the ditch in New Zealand to effectively register manuka honey as a trademark and as something of their own that is produced only in New Zealand. In my mind the Kiwis should not be allowed to get away with this. As I've indicated, this product comes from a plant that originates in Tasmania. It has a history going back a long way. It is an important product for the Australian honey industry, particularly the Tasmanian honey industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The suggestion that New Zealand should be able to trademark the name, quite frankly, to me is a complete absurdity. If I could send a clear message to our friends in the UK, where they are attempting to do that right now, it would be: 'Don't fall for this. The product clearly originates from Australia and Tasmania.' I say to those in the UK and in New Zealand: 'We don't mind sharing the name of the product. The global market for this variety of honey is big enough for us both.' It is a very high-value product and it has medicinal properties, which is one of the things that make it valuable. They don't have to pull some sort of smart alec stunt, like trying to trademark the name for themselves. We can work together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the view of the Australian Manuka Honey Association is that this market is big enough for us all. We can work together to market this great quality, high-value product around the world into the key markets, particularly the UK and Asia. We can share that name between us. We don't have to try to do each other over, as is occurring by New Zealand trying to trademark the name against its originator for their own gain. In my view this is purely an attempted marketing exercise by New Zealand. As I said, they should not be allowed to get away with it. I encourage them to work cooperatively with us.</span>

                  </a>  Senator, I take your interjection. Shame on New Zealand for doing that. They should be working cooperatively with us, as our industry is prepared to do with them, so that we can both take advantage of the value of this industry in high-value global markets. Supply of this product in the market is quite obviously limited by the availability of the manuka trees—the leptospermum and the other varieties that work with that. I urge the UK not to fall for that, but to allow us to get on and work together.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If the Senate passes this important legislation we, as some of the nation’s largest employers, commit to invest more in Australia which will lead to employing more Australians and therefore stronger wage growth as the tax cut takes effect.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that is economic orthodoxy: businesses investing more. That is, of course, precisely what we want to achieve by reducing our business tax rate and making it more competitive globally. It will lead to more jobs and higher wages. Don't take my word for it; that is what Bill Shorten used to say day in and day out when he was the Assistant Treasurer. He used to make that point day in and day out, and, of course, it is true. I refer you to Bill Shorten's very concise quote:</span>

None other than the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, made the point on 22 September 2015 that a higher company tax rate in Australia hits workers the hardest—not shareholders, workers—when he was advocating for a reduction in the business tax rate down to 25 per cent. Clearly, the senior business leaders of Australia thought it was very important to put a concise and very clear statement to the Senate. They very clearly spelled out that if this business tax cut is passed in full, it will lead to more investment, which of course will lead to more jobs and will lead to stronger wages growth as the tax cuts come into effect. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Senator Wong knows that companies in Australia have to pay their tax. Senator Wong knows that this government, not with any help from the Labor Party, has taken very strong action to ensure that all businesses in Australia pay their fair share of tax consistent with our laws. Our anti-avoidance provisions are some of the strongest in the world. What this particular extract refers to is some additional transparency measures, as developed by the Board of Taxation, in the form of the transparency code. This is a very specific additional commitment to additional transparency. As Senator Wong knows, that document has no status. It's not a document that was released by the Business Council of Australia. I think Senator Wong might know— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

April itself will mark the start of a significant program of military commemorations in Australia and overseas, with 2018 culminating in the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. Armistice Day, 11 November 2018, will mark the end of the most important commemorative period in Australia's military history, the Anzac Centenary, spanning 2014 to 2018. I'm sure all senators join me in encouraging all Australians to attend domestic and overseas services throughout 2018 to commemorate the service and sacrifice of the men and women who fought and died for our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know what a moving experience it is to attend a commemorative service in Australia and what a memorable experience it is to attend one overseas, often in places where Australians actually fought and fell. At home, commemorations will be held for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic, the 50th anniversary of the battles of Coral and Balmoral, the 65th anniversary of the Korean War armistice, the 75th anniversary of Australian forced labour at Hellfire Pass and the completion of the Thai-Burma railway, and of course the centenary of the First World War armistice. Overseas, Australians will commemorate the centenary of the battles of Villers-Bretonneux and Fromelles and the centenary of the First World War armistice. This year, the Australian government's role in support will be at Anzac Day services in France, Turkey, Belgium, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.</span>

It is, as I said, the most significant infrastructure project of the Australian government's Anzac Centenary program and provides a lasting international legacy for future generations. The official opening of the Sir John Monash Centre will take place on Tuesday, 24 April, next month, in Villers-Bretonneux in France. The state-of-the-art centre is designed to give visitors a unique understanding of Australia's experience of the Western Front battlefields of the First World War, and it's of course named after our most senior commanding general on the Western Front. I think it's important to note that, on this Anzac Day, in the centenary year of the end of World War I, as a chamber, we will remember them.</span>

This week the minister has on four occasions refused to echo the Prime Minister's guarantee that lower business taxes result in higher wages. On Tuesday, a secret survey revealed that four in five businesses ruled out increasing wages or employing more Australians as a result of the Turnbull government's $65 billion handout, and today it's been revealed that, in the BCA's letter to senators, big business deleted commitments to create Australian jobs, increase wages or even pay tax. How can the minister continue to tell Australian workers that the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut for big business will benefit them, when businesses clearly disagree?</span>

The Prime Minister and I are completely of one mind. Making our business tax rate more globally competitive in Australia will lead to additional investment and more jobs, and, as competition for workers increases across Australia, wages will grow more strongly. That is economic orthodoxy. This is as certain as Monday follows Sunday. I know that is not necessarily the view of the Left of the Labor Party, but that used to be the view of the Right of the Labor Party; indeed it used to be the view of Bill Shorten himself, who made the point:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian businesses compete with businesses from around the world. If we force them to pay higher taxes here than they have to pay in other parts of the world, we will lose investment and jobs to overseas. It will impact on the job opportunities, the job security and the career opportunities of Australian working families today and our children and grandchildren tomorrow. Australia is an open trading economy. We are exposed to global competition. In particular, our big businesses are on the frontline of global competition. If we continue to put them at a disadvantage, we will lose investment and jobs, and wages will actually drop if we're not careful. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

What I would say to you is what the Leader of the Opposition used to understand, and that is that more investment leads to more jobs and leads to higher wages. This is the core of our economic plan—and it is working. Look at what we've been able to secure in the economy over the last 12 months. More than 420,000 jobs were created over the last 12 months. That is employment growth of 3.3 per cent. What was employment growth under Labor in its last year in government? There were 80,000 new jobs under Labor in 12 months. There were 420,000 new jobs under the coalition. We want smaller businesses to become bigger, not smaller. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

On 28 February the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, met with representatives of the Shooting Industry Foundation and NIOA, Australia's largest privately owned supplier of small arms. Both NIOA and the foundation make significant donations to political parties. Were you aware that, at this meeting, Mr Dutton discussed issues of defence and national security with a gun lobby group that does not have national security clearance? Is the purpose of this advisory council to wind back the National Agreement on Firearms?</span>

But I might be wrong. So I can't be of assistance to you in terms of those ministers' diaries. I think you made reference to a firearms advisory council. Can I just make clear that there are no plans to establish a new firearms advisory council or committee. The Firearms Industry Reference Group has existed since August 2015 and comprises the firearms industry and the Australian government. The government regularly consults with the relevant stakeholders across industry to hear a range of views. That is really all I can assist you with at this time.</span>

The Turnbull government has no intention of changing the National Firearms Agreement, which, I think we would all agree, is one of John Howard's greatest legacies. We do have strong and effective gun laws that strike the right balance between keeping Australians safe and protecting the rights of law-abiding firearms owners.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  I thank the senator for that question. One of the most encouraging parts of Closing the Gap last week was the launch of the Indigenous business sector policy by the Prime Minister. The Indigenous Business Sector Strategy is, in fact, the first comprehensive roadmap for the sector. It has become necessary because of the impact of government policies on small businesses across the country. Success isn't a bad problem to have, but, when you get so many businesses moving ahead, you do need to have additional policies to assist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent census showed a 30 per cent increase in the number of Indigenous businesses since the previous census. This hasn't happened by accident. The government understands that, if Indigenous businesses are to succeed, we need to address their impediments to growth. Historically, this has been undercapitalisation. The Indigenous Procurement Policy was one of our answers to this. As we know, this has been a phenomenal success since we introduced it in 2015. Indigenous businesses have won, on a value-for-money basis, over a billion dollars in contracts. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the thousand Indigenous businesses across the country that have taken advantage of the opportunities we've created. This is, in fact, their achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The massive growth in the sector means that we need to ensure there are the support services in place for the sector to continue to grow. Even though there has been an exponential growth in the number of Indigenous Australians in business, this is still well below parity rates. If we can close this gap in economic participation then, modelling by Deloitte Access Economics shows, the economy will be $24 billion better off, through increased tax receipts and decreased welfare payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the new support services and the Indigenous Business Sector Strategy have been codesigned with the sector. That's how we do business—through codesign with the sector. It will ensure that the sector has the supports it needs to continue to grow and contribute to the Australian economy over the next decade.</span>

I'm proud that, as a part of the Western Sydney Airport development, there will be a 2.4 per cent Indigenous employment target and a three per cent Indigenous procurement target. These are not aspirations; these are contractual obligations. This will mean Indigenous Australians will be front and centre at the new works for a City Deal project such as the north-south rail link, the new aerotropolis and the $150 million Western Parkland City Liveability Program. We're also establishing what will be the first Indigenous business employment hub in Western Sydney in partnership with the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council. It will be a one-stop-shop for all new services in the Indigenous Business Sector Strategy. I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Mr Roy Ah-See and his leadership and the chair of the land council. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I have to say that Indigenous businesses were all but locked out of Commonwealth contracts when we came to government in 2013. Under the former policies, there were 30 Indigenous businesses—that's right, 30—winning a grand total of $6.2 million in contracts in 2012-13. The former Indigenous Opportunities Policy was hopelessly designed. It was all about red tape. It was unenforced and, unsurprisingly, achieved absolutely nothing. We took a different approach, reflecting on this side of the chamber's background of actually creating jobs and running small businesses. So we set a KPI for each departmental secretary, just like you would do in the private sector, with a quite simple, easily understood target. It would be published at the end of every year. It has worked: over a billion dollars in contracts compared with $6.2 million. We have shaken government procurement officers out of the business-as-usual process and require them to take a look at contracting with an Indigenous business.</span>

During question time last year, I asked what government was doing to assist consumers make informed choices about their health treatment. In particular, I reference the lack of publicly available IVF clinic performance data, which in effect rewards poorest-performing clinics. In 2014, live birth rates between clinics varied from between nine per cent and 24 per cent from fresh cycles. In 2012, it was as low as four per cent and up to 31 per cent. However, consumers aren't able to determine individual clinic results. Former Senator Nash, representing the minister, said government had been working with a range of stakeholders on 'the development of a transparency model'. Can the minister advise what work has been done on this transparency model, specifically related to assisted reproductive technology? And when will it be released to the public?</span>

Minister Hunt is supportive of work to increase the transparency of outcomes for patients. On 2 January this year, he announced the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Out-of-Pocket Costs, chaired by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy. The committee is investigating out-of-pocket costs and options to ensure that consumers are better informed of fees before agreeing to treatment. The committee has held two meetings: on 8 February and 23 March this year. The committee is due to provide a report to the minister at the end of 2018. Communiques are released shortly after each meeting.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, individual fertility clinics capture data on the outcomes of assisted reproductive technology treatment procedures. This data is collected and analysed by the Australia and New Zealand Assisted Reproduction Database, which is funded by the Fertility Society of Australia. Neither the public nor the Department of Health has direct access to this database. The IVF Directors Group has offered to work with the department, once they are satisfied with agreed data parameters, to introduce an improved database to collect assisted reproductive technology data that would be reconcilable with NBS data. Improved access to data may better inform clinical practice and better inform patients of their individual likely success rate.</span>

I know he's a big supporter of the resources sector and what it provides for our country. I, too, would like to recognise the mayor of Laverton. We're building a road, The Outback Way, to his little town. It'll be the third sealed road across our continent. It's a fantastic project to develop our nation. As a government, we also support the development of our nation through support for the resources sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, in the limited time I have, I want to speak about not just all the facts and figures that we often quote about what the resources sector provides—the taxes, the royalties and the exports—but also the people who are in the resources sector. Earlier today I gave an address to the Press Club where I highlighted a few stories of people. I met a young lady called Alicia at the Peak Downs coalmine in Central Queensland last year. She is a young graduate who got her start in life with BHP when she moved up to Dysart from Brisbane. Elizabeth, who runs a company called Gekko Systems, literally started her company in her garage. I caught up with her the other week in Toronto, where she's selling gold-processing technology to the world. It's a world leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The resources sector gives so many opportunities for Australians to compete on the world stage. Roger, who manages the Great Keppel Island Hideaway resort, is a third-generation coalminer. He is proud of the coal industry, but he's now in the tourism sector. He also loves the reef, and he understands that a strong resources sector in Central Queensland is needed to get people across to the islands to enjoy the reef, and spend good money doing so. Finally, Patrick is a native title owner. He's a representative of the Wangan and Jagalingou peoples. He's one of nearly 300 Wangan and Jagalingou people who turned up at a meeting almost two years ago today and supported the Adani mine 294-1. We also back how the resources sector can fulfil the promise we've made to first Australians to give them a better life.</span>

They are fundamentally wrong. Take the International Energy Agency's projections till 2040. If you take their central scenario, we'll all have to produce as much coal in the world in the first 40 years of this century as we ever have in history before—more in the first 40 years of this century than ever before, across the world. That's good news for Australia, because we have some of the highest quality, cleanest, best coals in the world. It is good news for jobs in Queensland. It's good news for jobs in New South Wales. It's good news for our prosperity right around the world. If only we can make sure we support the coal sector and the thousands of jobs that are in that sector, then we can take those opportunities and make sure we keep our prosperity high. That's what this government does. We support people with jobs, we support people who work hard and we want to continue to support the coal sector in this country.</span>

Never before in history have the economy and our livelihoods relied on the mining industry more than today. It's not just for energy, through oil or gas; it's not just through bulk commodities like iron ore or traditional hard rock metals like copper, zinc or nickel; there are a whole list of minerals that now are embodied in technology like that laptop there, which has lots of critical minerals. This phone here has heaps of rare earths in it. It's only because of those rare earths that we can enjoy all the mod cons of a modern society—including, I see, the Greens over there; they've got a few computers and phones. There's an iPad there for Senator Richard Di Natale. They wouldn't exist but for the mining industry. That's why we need to support it. That's why we support developing our critical minerals industry in Australia. That's why we've invested another $50 million today in a new CRC to develop new techniques to find new minerals so we can continue to use iPads, laptops and phones all around the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:36</span>):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. The Newstart allowance for a single person stands at a low $277.30 per week. I recognise that it was increased by $7 in early March. Newstart hasn't lifted in line with national living standards for a quarter of a century. Newstart is indexed to CPI rather than wages. Wages have a much greater impact on living standards than CPI and have grown faster than CPI over time. As a result, Newstart has shrunk to the level of average wages, median wages, minimum wage and age pension and is set to shrink further. The Business Council of Australia, in its submission to the 2012 Senate inquiry into Newstart, argued for increasing Newstart on adequacy and fairness grounds. KPMG, the Australian Council of Social Service and well-respected economists such as Chris Richardson have made similar calls. Will the government take the BCA's advice and increase Newstart to be reflective of the current need?</span>

The coalition knows that the best form of welfare is a job. The government wants a welfare system that supports the most vulnerable, encourages those capable of work or capable of study to do so, reduces intergenerational welfare dependency and is sustainable in the future. ACOSS argues that Newstart, on its own, is too low. However, less than one per cent of Newstart recipients receive Newstart alone. The other 99 per cent of Newstart recipients receive at least one additional payment and/or supplement based on their circumstances, as part of our strong social security safety net. This includes providing rent assistance to those in the private rental market and family tax benefit to those raising children. The coalition knows, as I have said, that the best form of welfare is a job, and under this government we have seen the largest increase in jobs since the GFC. The system also allows recipients to earn income from work or other sources before their payment is affected. It is also important to note that many recipients of Newstart do not remain on the payment for long. Around two-thirds of those granted Newstart exit income support within 12 months.</span>

Our welfare system encourages those capable of work or study to do so, while at the same time supporting vulnerable people within our society. Specifically, Australia targets, as I said, a bigger share of its cash transfers to households in the bottom income quintile than any other OECD country. The government remains committed to providing a range of programs and payments, but this must necessarily be balanced with the responsibility to ensure that family assistance and social security payments are well targeted and sustainable into the future.</span>

As I said, the government wants a welfare system that supports the most vulnerable, that encourages those capable of working and, most importantly, reduces intergenerational welfare dependency, and we want to make it sustainable into the future. We want to encourage people to either work or study. I think it's important to note that, when we look at those on welfare, we consider them in their entirety. As I said, 99 per cent of Newstart recipients receive additional payments, additional supplements, based on their circumstances as part of our strong social security system. This includes providing rent assistance to those in the private rental market of up to $176 per fortnight for families. That equates to about $4,500 a year. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The OECD Development Assistance Committee 2018 peer review of Australia, published this week, on Tuesday, has found that cuts to Australia's international development budget have impacted on Australia's international profile and reputation and that 'Australia now needs to restore its official development assistance'. Since 2013, the Abbott-Turnbull government has slashed Australia's international development budget by well over $11 billion. Can the minister confirm that, under the Turnbull government, Australia's total spend on international development assistance is projected to fall to 0.2 per cent of gross national income by 2020-21? That's the lowest level since records were first kept.</span>

It's a bit rich for the opposition to come in here and attack our overseas development assistance.

Last week it was my pleasure to attend the Commonwealth Bank Teaching Awards, which recognise and reward 12 outstanding teachers and school leaders for the way in which they improve the learning outcomes of Australian students. That came hot on the heels of the recent Highly Accomplished and Lead Teacher Summit. The Highly Accomplished and Lead Teachers program recognises certified outstanding teachers whose practice sets a benchmark and provides an example of the real impacts that great teaching practice has on student learning. Professor John Hattie, of the University of Melbourne and chair of AITSL, and a range of international experts from the OECD and elsewhere presented at the HALT summit, which recognised the quality of teaching.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Bank Teaching Awards were delivered by Australian Schools Plus—and I acknowledge Senator Collins' role in the establishment of Australian Schools Plus. Australian Schools Plus Pioneers in Philanthropy is chaired by David Gonski. I acknowledge his contribution and the contribution of many of the Pioneers of Australian Schools Plus. Australian Schools Plus provided awards to a number of teachers of outstanding practice. I particularly acknowledge and congratulate on the record Matthew Eyles, from Hobart College, for his innovative real-world experiences in health; Yasodai Selvakumaran, from Rooty Hill High School, for her specialist knowledge and focus on history and society; Kerry White, from Holy Family Catholic School in South Australia, for positive education initiatives; and Greg McMahon, from Doveton College in Victoria, for drawing on international research to overhaul the school's approach to teaching and learning. Each of these award winners is an outstanding example to their colleagues and sets a benchmark that is met by many other quality teachers across the country in the way they provide outstanding learning opportunities to their students.</span>

Many of Friday's award winners were recognised for the improved NAPLAN results of their students, which many cited in their applications. Some of those have improved quite dramatically. Ann Caro, from Lithgow High School, highlighted that her students have improved dramatically in the Higher School Certificate and NAPLAN results. John Cleary, a HALT teacher from Casuarina Street Primary School in the Northern Territory, noted that his students now had one of the nation's best NAPLAN-measured improvements between years 3 and 5 in reading, writing and numeracy. John Goh, from Merrylands East Public School in New South Wales, stressed that the literacy and numeracy results in that school had improved dramatically. And Paul Kenna, of Belle Vue Park Primary School in Victoria, highlighted that the NAPLAN results over the past four years show that the school is now well above growth measures for similar student cohorts. This demonstrates that these teachers are using measures and tools to assess the success in their classrooms.</span>

The reforms, as a result of the TEMAG program, around initial teacher education are ensuring higher benchmarks for those leaving our higher education institutions in future, around the quality of their teaching practice. As has been discussed many times before, the Turnbull government is delivering record and growing funding into Australian schools, across all states, across all different sectors, providing an extra $25 billion, distributed fairly, according to need. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Australia is on so much better a trajectory today than we were. The trajectory that we are on now is a trajectory of 420,000 more jobs. We are on a trajectory of implementing our plan for the economy, for jobs and growth. The Australian people are still waiting for Labor's plan for jobs and growth. Let me mention something to the Labor Party that might sound familiar to you: 'It's time'—it's time for your plan for jobs and growth. Let me say that again: 'It's time.' Do you want me to go for the jingle? It's time for your plan for jobs and growth. You see, Labor doesn't have a plan for jobs and growth. You have a plan for higher taxes and for more spending.</span>

                  </a>  I'm so pleased that Senator Wong agrees that it's time for Labor's plan for jobs and growth, because there is none. The only side of politics that has a plan for jobs and growth, which is delivering results, is the Liberal and Nationals parties'. And let me tell you that the trajectory that Australia is on today is a much better trajectory than the one that we inherited from the Labor Party. When we came into government, the economy was weakening; unemployment was rising; the budget position was deteriorating. You know what? Today, the economy is strengthening, employment growth is strengthening, the unemployment rate is below where it was expected to be and the budget position is improving. We are now on track to a believable return to surplus. That is what the Australian people are interested in. The Australian people are not interested in the juvenile political games of the Labor Party. You continue to play student politics. We will continue to focus on the national interest and on implementing our plan for jobs and growth.</span>

Yesterday Senator Hinch stated that the in-home counselling services provided by Dementia Australia have 'always been a free service funded by the federal government'. I'm advised that, unfortunately, the information he has been provided with is not correct. Previously, until June 2016—I'm sorry, Senator Hinch can't hear.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  I think something has happened with the microphone, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. I would ask senators who are leaving the chamber to do so promptly and quietly, and everyone else to listen politely and quietly to the response from the minister.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:</span>
                  </a>  I will recommence. Yesterday, Senator Hinch, you asked me a question about in-home counselling services provided by Dementia Australia and you said that they'd 'always been a free service funded by the federal government'. I'm advised that that information is not correct. Previously, until June 2016, dementia services were funded through the Victorian government's Home and Community Care, HACC, program. In June 2016, the Victorian government transitioned their services under their Home and Community Care program to the federal government's Commonwealth Home Support Program. This included dementia services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, I would like to clarify that the information that was provided by the Dementia Australia hotline that 'the government makes us charge that fee' is also not correct. Under the federal government's Commonwealth Home Support Program, the Commonwealth does not mandate specific fees. Fees are determined by the individual providers. In regard to your specific question about Australians who are unable to afford the fee, the federal government's Commonwealth Home Support Program clients are only expected to contribute if they can afford to do so. Those who cannot are not expected to contribute. This ensures that those who have the means contribute, while those most vulnerable are protected. In the 2017-18 budget, the Turnbull government announced a funding injection of $5.5 billion to extend the funding arrangements of the Commonwealth Home Support program from 2018-19 to 2019-20. This boost means that more senior Australians are receiving care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in relation to your question, Senator Hinch, regarding waiting times, the latest advice provided to me from Dementia Australia is that there is currently no waiting list in places for services in Victoria. We will endeavour to continue to follow up about the six-week wait time, if you raise it again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  I just remind ministers that, if you are responding to questions that you've taken on notice, the convention is, if they're more than a couple of paragraphs, you would seek leave to have them incorporated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Wong today relating to proposed company tax cuts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I say that today we confirmed, again, the extent of the persistent and wilful misleading by the government about the so-called benefits of their $65 billion tax cut for big business. I want to emphasise that this debate for Labor has never been about whether or not we recognise the contribution that business makes to the economy, and neither has this debate been about any less recognition of the importance of growing the national economy, which is so crucial to the standard of living we all enjoy. Recall that it was Labor governments which engaged in the economic reforms that have enabled the extraordinary, unbroken period of economic growth to the benefit of the nation. We also understand business needs the right policy settings to grow and prosper, but it's not a one-way street.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The taxes paid by companies, and, indeed, all Australians, are what fund the education and training system for the workers they employ. Those taxes are what build the infrastructure that business needs to do business and to get its products to the world. In this country, unlike many others, it is those taxes, not business, that pay for the health care of their workforce and that have given Australia amongst the best health outcomes in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember the famous quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it's been so disappointing to discover that so many in the business community are simply not prepared to be a part of this grand bargain. It is so disappointing to know that, when asked to sign a letter from the Business Council of Australia pledging that in return for the $65 billion in tax cuts they would increase wages, big business said no. When asked if, in return for the $65 billion in tax cuts, they would create more Australian jobs in the cities, suburbs, towns and bush, what did they say? No. When asked if, in return for those $65 billion in tax cuts, they would commit to paying their tax, they said no. In return for the $65 billion in tax cuts this government is proposing, we have big business refusing to commit to higher wages, refusing to commit to new jobs and refusing to even commit to paying their tax—a pretty extraordinary and a pretty disappointing response from business. I've got to say, I find it pretty disappointing on a personal level. I've always been one of the people on this side of the chamber who has sought to engage with the business community. I've worked with them in government and in opposition. But when those in the business community, who are urging this chamber and the Australian people to support this level of tax cut, are not prepared to live up to their side of the bargain in return for these tax cuts, they tell us all something quite important about the extent to which they are prepared to contribute to the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even worse than the behaviour of business here has been the behaviour of this Prime Minister and his government. Frankly, their dishonesty and deceit in their case for the tax cut has been exposed. Time after time we have been assured this tax cut will drive up wages, create jobs and lead to business paying more tax. Remember that argument? I think it's the Laffer Curve argument. But we know it's not true, and that has been confirmed again today. There has never been any basis for making these claims. We shouldn't be surprised about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember the deceit that has surrounded this tax cut from day one? Remember in 2016 when this PM couldn't even tell Australians how much this tax cut would cost? Two days later we had to drag out of Treasury officials, I think in estimates, that it would cost $50 billion, and we now know, a year later, that the cost is $65 billion. I think Australians deserve more. They deserve a lot more than a government that's prepared to wilfully mislead them about the effect over the next decade of the single biggest handout plan by either side of politics. The honesty should begin now. It should begin today with the government abandoning the tax cut, recognising and admitting its argument is flawed and that the tax cut is unaffordable. That is why Labor says no at a time when the government has sent debt soaring above half a trillion dollars, has cut funding to schools and hospitals, and is hiking tax on middle Australia. Remember that: hiking tax on middle Australia. Our priority cannot be a $65 billion handout to Australia's powerful corporations. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  It's my great honour to have the opportunity to respond to Senator Wong's motion to take note. If we needed any more evidence at all that the Labor Party, which she represents in this chamber, has no plan whatsoever to stimulate investment, to stimulate growth, to create jobs and to increase wages, then that speech was evidence of it. It contained no ideas, it contained no proposals and it contained no measures from the alternative government of Australia. All it contained was rhetoric and criticism and complaint. There was not one constructive suggestion or proposal anywhere in that speech. It contained a number of what I would characterise as intellectual errors and sloppiness that I wouldn't expect to see from someone of the stature of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—herself a former finance minister. I particularly appreciated the emphasis that Senator Wong placed on the supposed letter from the Business Council of Australia and how they have seized upon this as evidence that, if company tax is cut in Australia, there will be no increase in investment, there will be no increase in employment, there will be no increase in wages and there will be no increase in tax revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Wong would know well from her time as finance minister, businesses don't pay taxes in this country as part of some kind of bargain, as she characterised it, or because they've signed a letter to the Senate crossbench or anyone else for that matter. They pay tax because they are legally required to, and they pay tax when they make a profit. Anything that we can do to ensure that business is making a profit and is therefore paying tax is a very prudent and sensible thing to do, and that's exactly what the government's enterprise tax plan does. It will stimulate investment by increasing the return on that investment and will encourage investors, both domestic and foreign, to invest more of their scarce capital here in Australia—as opposed to other places in the world where they could invest it—by guaranteeing them a better return on that investment. They won't be investing because of goodwill and they won't be investing because they love Australia or our weather or our food or our furry animals; they'll be investing because they'll be able to get a better return than they once did and they'll be able to get a better return here relative to the alternative places they could invest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The word 'backflip' is often abused in political commentary. Usually the word 'backflip' is applied to a party or a person who changes their position on something. But, of course, when you do a backflip, you're flipping around and falling exactly where you were before. In a funny way, that's what the Labor opposition has done this week. We know, as Senator Cormann quoted throughout question time today, that Senator Wong, the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, have all been on the record in the past very eloquently supporting the case for business tax cuts in this country. They were then dragged, perhaps by the Greens or others, to oppose that position, and this week we have seen that they're on the way back to supporting them again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Shorten revealed this week that they may support the tax cut that has already been legislated for small and medium sized enterprises with up to $50 million in revenue. The backflip completed this week by the opposition is a real backflip indeed. They are back to a position that they used to hold a couple of years ago. It's good progress. I welcome it. There's only a little bit further for them to go. They should keep heading down the path that they're on. They should concede the argument, as they clearly have, that tax cuts for small and medium enterprise businesses are a good thing and the right thing to support, and they should follow that position to its logical conclusion. They should realise that supporting tax cuts for businesses with over $50 million in revenue will have the same beneficial impact as cutting taxes for businesses with under $50 million in revenue. In fact, as some economists argue, there is reason to believe that the beneficial impact of cutting taxes for businesses with over $50 million in revenue may be larger than the benefit from cutting taxes for small- and medium-sized businesses—though, no doubt, the impact will be positive for both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the sign this week is that the opposition are on a positive trajectory, a sensible trajectory. I hope they're reconsidering their previous populist opposition to company tax cuts. I hope they will do a real backflip in relation to the position they all held not that long ago, much as it might trouble some on their benches, Senator Cameron and Senator Carr included. Their own colleagues have very eloquently supported the case for business tax cuts in the past. I hope we will see them do so again. We've seen a ray of hope this week. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We may soon be able to see a much more sensible policy on business tax cuts from the opposition.</span>

                  <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  As I rise to take note of answers, I remind the good senator, Senator Paterson, that this debate is about taking note of an answer provided by a minister, in this case the Minister for Finance. A lot of Senator Paterson's contribution today was about attacking the Labor Party. I can see why he may have wanted to use up his time in the debate to do that, because I'm sure he would have been embarrassed by the answer that was given by the finance minister today to the question that was asked of him. It was an interesting answer that he gave today. He continued to persist with this belief that the government's $65 billion gift to big business will create jobs and lead to higher wages, despite all the evidence to the contrary. I simply can't understand how the members of the government continue with such complete certainty, when so much research and commentary and now even the Business Council's very own words—or, should I say, lack of words—contradict them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government tried to say that they are sure that their cash handout to big business will create jobs and result in higher wages, but do you know who isn't so sure? Big business. Surely, if you're going to go ahead and give away $65 billion of taxpayers' money, you'd want to make sure you get something in return. But, no, the government are pushing ahead anyway. They're determined to see this handout happen, no matter what the result. They're certain that $65 billion to big business will be good for the economy. But, if so, why wasn't the Business Council willing to make that commitment to the government? Why is it that the leaked letter that Senator Wong tabled here today—about which they shut down debate in the House of Representatives only hours ago—clearly shows us a before and an after? It shows a 'before letter', with a proposed commitment to create jobs, invest in Australia and pay tax, and an 'after letter', with none of those commitments included. It simply beggars belief that the government refuse to understand this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the leaking of a letter as plain as this, the finance minister should have been in front of the media, hat in hand, apologising to the Australian people and asking them to forget the whole thing and act like he'd never even tried to give away the public's money. Yet, somehow, the government continue to remain determined to legislate this corporate tax cut. Somehow, they're determined to push on. The government have been unable to get the numbers in the Senate today because this is bad policy. The leaked BCA letter today shows that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Fairfax media reported today, BCA members have apparently been negotiating on the terms of this letter for months, and good on them; they've got a right to be involved in public affairs. But, surely, during that time, a little bit of this government's certainty would have rubbed off on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely, if it's as plain as day that a tax cut is going to deliver more jobs, wages and taxes, this is exactly the kind of thing the BCA would've been able to get its members to sign on to. The government may be sure that a $65 billion gift to big business is going to lead to jobs, but apparently the BCA aren't. You'd think that, at a time when the OECD and the IMF are warning about the dangers of inequality to the economy, the government would be doing everything that it could do to see a pay rise for everyday Australians. But, only today, we've seen representatives of underpaid, early childhood educators here at Parliament House demanding better conditions. These educators are paid just $21 an hour, despite looking after Australia's future. How is it that this government could possibly be focused on gifting away cash to big business and they couldn't even meet with these workers today? I wish Senator Martin were here today to see this debate that is happening. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  I rise to take note of the contribution of Senator Brown and of course the contributions made by Senator Cormann and particularly Senator Fierravanti-Wells in the course of today's debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Senator Wong interjecting</span>—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:</span>  Thank you, Senator Wong. Senator Stoker, in taking note, you're taking note of answers to questions. Senator Wong took note of answers provided by Senator Cormann, so that really needs to be the premise of your five-minute contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="237920" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator STOKER:</span>
                  </a>  Certainly. In the course of question time, Senator Cormann exposed Labor's complaint about the enterprise tax cuts that are before this parliament; he exposed that complaint for the misconception that it is. The policy to cut business tax rates doesn't work because the Business Council of Australia says it will or won't. It doesn't work because anybody else might write a letter expressing their opinion. It works, as Senator Cormann has explained, because it is basic economics. When we cut business tax rates, we attract capital and investment to this country. When we cut business tax rates, we empower businesses to reinvest in this country. We empower them to put more and more into growing their business. And what does that mean for Australians? It means the confidence to take on more staff, to create more jobs. It means that, as those jobs are created, unemployment reduces and competition for workers increases. It means that competition drives growing wages throughout the economy, and good employment opportunities and wages growth empower the confidence of Australian workers. It empowers them to spend. It empowers them to buy a home, to save for their retirement and to do all of the things that are so important to ordinary Australians reaching their potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is good for the Australian economy, and, as Senator Cormann noted today, Labor knows it too. That's why Mr Shorten has expressed his firm support in the past for business tax cuts. He knows deep down that's what the Australian economy needs. He might be from the opposition, but I'll give him credit where it's due—he is right when he says so. But, when it became politically expedient, he abandoned that commitment. He abandoned common sense and he flip-flopped to now oppose what is a sensible measure to create growth in this economy. Mr Shorten, as Senator Cormann noted, flip-flopped like a pancake on the need to use business tax cuts to grow the Australian economy and create opportunities for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He did so just like he flipped on the need to invest in regional Queensland. He flipped just like he did on the importance of the Adani Carmichael mine in North Queensland, which will create desperately needed jobs for North Queenslanders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, in contrast, is absolutely committed to building opportunity and jobs in this country. All of the evidence that is before this parliament, including the Australian Treasury's modelling when it examined international trends in company tax rates and the implications for Australian company tax, shows that as these rates are reduced there is an enormous benefit to the Australian economy. All of it shows that, as company tax rates reduce, there is growth in the corporate sector, increased profitability and increased opportunity for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the answers given by Senator Fierravanti-Wells in the course of question time. She explained how important the Australian coalition's commitment is to providing support to our partners throughout the Asia-Pacific region. It's worth noting that aid has increased in this country. In 2017-18 it rose to $3.9 billion, which is a 2.2 per cent increase on the previous year. That program is committed to providing lifesaving assistance to those in need. We are giving $399.7 million in this financial year to humanitarian emergency and disaster relief. The government doesn't commit to prescriptive time-bound targets, but it will always remain focused on delivering results for the people in our region and security for this nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  It's a pleasure to follow on from Senator Stoker, but unfortunately, being a fellow Queensland senator, I'm going to have to disagree with the senator in this debate. I want to pick up on one word that the senator used, and that is 'exposed'. There is only one thing that has been exposed today and that's the hoax that Senator Cormann and their big business mates, in conjunction with their work with the Business Council of Australia, were purporting to have on the Australian people, Australian workers and Australian families. That's what was exposed in the question from Senator Wong. It has also been unravelling this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see in this debate around company tax is that it really is about priorities. Australian families know and understand that those on that side are on the side of big business and the banks, whereas we on this side are on the side of Australian families and Australian workers, and we are absolutely proud to be so. What we have seen exposed this week has been as a result of the desperation of Senator Cormann and his government to get a deal done with the crossbench. They will say and do anything to convince the crossbenchers to sign up with them and also to convince the Australian public. I'm very thankful that there are a number of crossbenchers who were prepared to hold out and ensure that the hoax those opposite were trying to purport was exposed. That's happened throughout this week because of what happened within the Business Council of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, there was a survey that contradicted their public stance. This was exposed earlier in the week. It basically went to CEOs not actually investing the money into wages or further growth in Australia. It actually started with the survey. What we have seen exposed by Senator Wong through her question to Senator Cormann today is the letter they were touting to the crossbench. They were using this letter to convince the crossbenchers to sign up to support the big business tax breaks that the government has been supporting. It exposed that as a hoax as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me go through in detail what elements of that have been a hoax. First, they deleted a commitment to increase wages. That is one of the key selling points that those opposite have been using. It was in the draft letter that the BCA put together, but it was deleted from that. They also deleted the commitment in there that they would create more Australian jobs in the cities, suburbs, towns and bush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's very Churchillian, almost like it was from Senator Cormann yesterday. That came out. For those people out there who are looking for work or for those in areas where there is a depressed employment market, they deleted the comment that would have given those people some hope. And this, for me, is just gobsmacking: they deleted a commitment 'to pay our tax'. Rightly, Australians are sceptical about the hoax that has been put forward. What really is exposed here is that there's a public view that they put out to try and convince the crossbench senators and the public of what their position is, and then they've got a private view. That private view should be very concerning if you are an Australian worker or an Australian family out there, because they make no commitment, in private, to doing what they are saying in public, and that is what has been exposed through this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when we look at the consequences of what this big business tax cut would mean, what we on the Labor side know, and what Australian families know, is this will result in a cut to services—cuts to health, cuts to education. Where does this impact the most? In regional areas. So there are no commitments to jobs and no commitments to investment. That's all a public hoax. But, when we look up what they're privately committed to, it will mean cuts to health and cuts to education that will have a devastating impact on communities, particularly those in regional areas that most rely on this. These communities see no benefit; all they see is the downside. And they will absolutely hold this government to account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, as I said at the start, that this is all about priorities. What the Australian public know is that those opposite are on the side of big business and the banks. Those on this side are on the side of Australian families and Australian workers, and I absolutely know where we will stay as we fight this until the next election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) to a question without notice asked by Senator Rhiannon today relating to firearms controls.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's response on firearms was absolutely inadequate. Again, it really demonstrates how this government is increasingly attempting to walk both sides of the road when it comes to addressing the issue of firearms. On the one hand, it attempts to bask in past glory. We are going back 20 years here, when the former, Howard-Fischer government came forward with the quite remarkable achievement of the National Firearms Agreement. That is when all the states and territories came on board with a consistent approach to gun control across the states so that hopefully there would never again be a massacre on any scale involving firearms—nothing like the tragic loss of life where 35 people were killed in Tasmania in 1996. That's on the one hand—and it is a lot to be proud of. But already it's been rewound. It was being rewound before these latest developments in the last few days of the Tasmanian election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of what the Liberal government is doing in Tasmania, we are seeing the Turnbull government effectively being silent. They've made a few comments about the issue but, in terms of really spelling out what their response is to the very serious wind-back that the Tasmanian Liberal government is proposing, it is shocking, because we're talking about human lives here. When guns are more readily available, we know people are more likely to die and to be wounded. That's where the government are shocking. They're shocking because they're working with the firearms industry, and they're also working with the firearms lobby and the firearms parties because they often get support when they are in balance-of-power stations. What is going on is deeply ugly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember how far-reaching the changes are in Tasmania. It's worth remembering the tactics going on here with the firearms industry. If they can achieve some or all of these changes in Tasmania, it's a development that will put further pressure on other states when it comes to their own firearms laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The big one that's come out that's really disturbing people is the move in Tasmania to increase the period that people can have a gun licence for from five to 10 years. In 1996, when this was debated, it was identified that it should not be longer than five years, because people's lives change—their mental health might deteriorate—and five years is as long as a person should have a licence in one hit. Then they want to abolish mandatory weapons removal for minor breaches of firearms storage laws, allowing greater access to category C firearms such as self-loading rifles and pump-action shotguns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are enormous changes, and they come off the back of many changes in other states and territories that effectively are already breaking up the National Firearms Agreement. One of its huge achievements was that it was consistent, but now we find that in many states it's legal for children to use firearms. In New South Wales, the Shooters Party want changes for people who had firearms who were then on an AVO, so that they can get their guns back more quickly. These are very serious developments, particularly when we reflect on the shocking figures about how many women die in domestic violence incidents, often from shocking gun crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to bring political donations into this debate. The gun industry is on the rise and has got a seat at the table when it comes to making these laws. At the same time, it is handing over large amounts of money. In 2015-16, the gun industry donated more than $350,000 to Australian political parties. That amount of money has been going up steadily in recent years. In 2010-11 it was only a bit over $21,000. Then it was about $100,000 in following years, jumping to $350,000—to conservative parties like the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Shooters Party. This is a very ugly side of where our politics is going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is needed—and this is what the minister should have said in his response today—is for the government to commit to tightening the National Agreement on Firearms so we ensure that public safety is the clear responsibility of the government and that's what they will give attention to. At the moment, the Turnbull government are allowing it to unravel. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Similar and highly successful advanced technology initiatives such as the SmartGate and Govpass programs have prioritised accuracy, user testing and service delivery. The government is building robust privacy safeguards into the capability, including by conducting independent privacy impact assessments throughout the design and implementation phases.</span>

                  </a>  In the Australian context, the collection, use, storage, access and disclosure of personal information by government agencies and certain private sector organisations is governed by the Privacy Act. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation includes requirements that resemble those in the Privacy Act. The government recently strengthened the protections under the Privacy Act by introducing a Notifiable Data Breaches scheme. This scheme requires notification to affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner where an entity that is subject to the Privacy Act experiences a data breach of personal information that poses a likely risk of serious harm to affected individuals.</span>

While Labor believes that the EU's General Data Protection Regulation should be carefully examined by the Australian government as a model for possible legal reforms here, Labor holds that all proposals for major changes to Australian law should be carefully considered and consulted on by experts, key stakeholders and the wider Australia community.</span>

                  </a>  What a strange sight we have seen before us in the last two motions before this place. These were simple, non-radical proposals related to the protection of the data of Australian citizens to ensure that they have the right that they deserve to be able to access their data and give explicit consent to its use. One wants to ensure that all steps be taken to ensure that facial biometric recognition technology does not suffer from the same critical errors that we have seen in the US. This motion before us relates to enhancing to world's best practice the rights of Australians' data. I really do wonder what fears live in the hearts of the members of both of the parties opposite that they are not prepared to take these simple steps to safeguard the privacy rights of Australian citizens. I will proudly vote with my colleagues in support of this motion. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As all members of this house know, for more than five years I have been a very strong advocate for the use of whole plant medicinal cannabis. It came off the back of a woman I met who was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Surgery was out of the question and conventional drugs had left her for dead. Imagine a doctor saying, 'Sorry darl, everything we've done just won't stop the cancer,' or, 'Sorry darl, I can't prescribe you anything stronger to deal with the pain you're suffering; you are already on the most potent,' or, 'Sorry darl, your child will have to be kept in a comatose-like state because there are no other drugs that will stop the seizures.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secretly, the majority of people in the Senate support the use of whole plant medicinal cannabis, as I do. The problem is that too many of you are too gutless to take the necessary steps to make any change and come into line with the thinking of most of the general public. Why? Because you fear what your pharmaceutical mates might come out and say or, worse still, you fear they'll pull your political donations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might ask yourself why One Nation would bring to this chamber a matter of public urgency regarding whole plant medicinal cannabis. The truth is that up to 100,000 Australians are being forced to break the law by sourcing medicinal cannabis oil from the black market. These people are our next-door neighbours, our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters or our uncles and aunts. They are everyday people caught in a world of pain and suffering. They are people who can't wait any longer. It's almost as if the cold weather down here in Canberra freezes the hearts of elected members. Unless you've suffered the effects of chemotherapy, epilepsy, tremors, PTSD or one of the dozens of other symptoms medicinal cannabis can assist you with, you really don't know what I'm talking about. I have no doubt you all know someone going through these symptoms, so I ask you all here today: why are you preventing the use of a natural drug?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Queensland, the Labor government and the health department are denying medicinal cannabis oil to a nine-year-old girl by the name of Caitlin, and instead want to dope her up on oxycodone, OxyContin, tramadol and diazepam. Each and every time this girl is forced to take pharmaceutical drugs of this nature, her body shuts down. Medicinal cannabis oil is the only thing that gives her any quality of life. Right this minute, nine-year-old Caitlin needs an urgent operation to extend the growth rods in her back and the health department refused to allow her mother to administer medicinal cannabis oil while she's in the hospital. Even Caitlin's own doctor has written a letter of support to allow her to keep using cannabis oil, which the Labor government and the Queensland health department refuse to acknowledge. This is just one case of the 100,000 people forced to source illegal black-market medicinal cannabis oil.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day, my office, my website and my Facebook page receive contact from people asking why they cannot access this pain-relieving product. Why are we so behind the eight ball in Australia in this field compared to many other countries in the world? And, yet, this government went to the election on a platform of innovation and jobs. I'm telling you right now: medical cannabis oil is innovative. It will get people back to work sooner. It will stop so much suffering and mitigate the tears that flow every single day from helpless family members who sit and watch their loved ones in pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to highlight that there are very few people in politics willing to put their heads on the chopping block and fight so hard on this matter. I take my hat off to Steve Dickson, who did that just last year when he came to One Nation because of this very subject. No-one in his former party were willing to step up and speak out on this subject, and I want to thank Steve Dickson for continuously helping me keep this matter in the public arena and pushing for legislative reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Australian government has approved the growing, harvesting and manufacturing of whole-plant medicinal cannabis. So why can't everyday Australians get access? It is not because the product goes off, because it can be kept unrefrigerated for up to 12 months. I'll tell you why Aussies can't get access to medical cannabis—it's because of the onerous paperwork and bureaucracy. Every single one of us in this chamber today has the ability to change that. That's what we were elected to do—to make decisions for the greater good of everyday people. Bureaucrats weren't elected; we were. Pharmaceutical companies were not elected; we were. I'm not interested in synthetic products produced by greedy pharmaceutical companies, and neither are the public. We want access to the real deal. Please, no more excuses. No more telling me, 'We're doing our best to give sufferers access,' because the public are telling me they can't access it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  Today I rise to speak on the urgency motion put forward in this place by Senator Hanson. I want to place on the record that Labor have consistently fought for improved access to medical cannabis in circumstances where it's clinically desirable for patients. We've been listening to patients. I've met with patients. I know that the shadow health minister Catherine King has also met with patients. We have put forward our own clear thoughts on these issues. But what we have seen coming from the government, on the other hand, is them very much dragging their heels on this issue. When they finally established a national scheme, it was so complicated and had so many barriers to access that people simply gave up. This goes some way to highlighting the kinds of issues that Senator Hanson has raised in the Senate today. Instead of prioritising access for patients, what the government did at that time—and still does—was stigmatise desperate Australians who were unwell, who were dying or who had serious conditions such as epilepsy and were trying to overcome the barriers in the system to access medical cannabis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to be clear about the motion that's before us today. It is simply a statement of opinion before this place. Being so, it's an attempt by Senator Hanson to try to hide her failure to stand up in this place for better medical access to cannabis.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator PRATT:</span>
                  </a>  I'm happy for you to interject, Senator Hanson, but the critical matter is this: when, in May, this Senate voted to disallow the government's restrictions on access to medicinal cannabis, under category A of the Special Access Scheme, in recognition that access to category A has always been tightly restricted to people with a terminal illness, and only if it's clinically appropriate, Senator Hanson and her colleagues voted with the government against the disallowance. So Senator Hanson voted that medicinal cannabis should only be made available and tightly restricted to people with a terminal illness. Those are not the circumstances which you've brought to the parliament today. I'm very glad to hear you've had a change of heart. But I need to call you out on it because it was disappointing to advocates and families, at the time, when you voted against easier access to medicinal cannabis for those who needed it. So today's attempt, I think, from Senator Hanson, is an attempt to hide those failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though the Senate did successfully disallow the government's regulations—the government and One Nation voted together; the Greens, the Labor Party and others voted to disallow the regulations—the government has not responded appropriately, and I would call on Senator Hanson to use her close relationships with the government to put some real pressure on them. Terminally ill patients should, at that time, have been given easier access to a prescribed therapy to ease their suffering. But what we've seen instead from the government in the months since is an attempt to block the parliament's will and to continue to deny relief to dying Australians. Labor supports today's urgency motion and, indeed, the principle of urgency on this topic, because the government deserves to be sent a clear message that more needs to be done, and we want to send a message of support to all of those people who are suffering from their failure to act. We think the status quo is simply not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are people for whom access to medicinal cannabis is clinically desirable for their conditions. I spoke to a young woman with epilepsy in Western Australia. She buys her medicinal cannabis on the black market, because it's the only thing that gives her any respite from regular epileptic fits, but she has no clear pathway to purchase it in a legal manner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that, even if today's vote is successful, it won't actually change anything for people seeking improved access to medicinal cannabis. Senator Hanson's urgency motion fails to recognise some significant things about the way our system works currently, and things that simply have to be fixed properly for people to get access to medicinal cannabis. One thing I'd like to highlight to the chamber is Australia's international obligations under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. What patients seek, as to access to medicinal cannabis, is a considered policy—that's what we need: to provide access, through a GP, to a regulated, quality supply of medicinal cannabis. And that is not what this motion before us puts forward today.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator PRATT:</span>
                  </a>  I can read the motion. It says that there's professional support for medicinal cannabis and that it needs to be listed on schedule 4 of the Therapeutic Goods Act. But let's be clear: there are different schedules, and, I'm not sure as to whether it belongs in schedule 4 or a different schedule. We have tightly controlled opiate drugs, which are also very desired on the black market for drug use, that are prescribed, and, as far as I understand, they don't belong on schedule 4, so we need to look very carefully at which schedule these drugs belong on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that people have a clear, accessible pathway. I have spoken to patients in Western Australia who, despite the supposed process of the TGA and the supposed processes of state governments to give people access to medicinal cannabis, could still not find a prescribing doctor. And the paperwork attached to being a prescribing doctor and putting yourself out there and finding a supplier—which you can't find regularly through a pharmacy—has proven just too great for too many patients in getting access to the medicinal cannabis that would help them and their children and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Labor, in 2015, made a very clear commitment that we wanted to work with state and territory governments to ensure there were nationally consistent laws to allow successful access to medicinal cannabis for those who are terminally ill or who have other clinically identified medical conditions that medicinal cannabis may benefit. What we've seen in the Turnbull government is a government that is too slow in catching up and in adopting a similar policy to Labor's. And it's been even slower, I have to tell you, in implementing anything. You've been too focused on getting headlines and have forgotten about patients. Let's be clear: this is not about allowing free access to a drug for recreational use—although I would like to put on the record how proud I was to be part of the Gallop Labor government that back in the early 2000s decriminalised cannabis in small quantities because of the large social toll that it was taking on the community in terms of putting people on a criminal pathway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not what we are debating today. It is about ensuring that there is a legal and regulated market so that family members and carers aren't forced to rely on the black market to relieve the pain of their loved ones. We have seen in report after report that patients are facing barrier after barrier. It's almost impossible to find a prescribing doctor. When I spoke to patients in Western Australia, they could not identify any, despite the fact that doctors now have a right to prescribe this drug. So they've given up hope that things will become easier and they don't believe what the Turnbull government says. They've trusted them before and things have not improved. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I rise to speak to this urgency motion about access to medicinal cannabis. It's an issue which is a personal passion of mine and a key priority of the Australian Greens. It's long past time that Australians got access to medicinal cannabis treatments—treatments that we know work, treatments that have the potential to relieve pain and suffering, treatments that can prevent nausea, treatments that can ease the symptoms associated with conditions like multiple sclerosis, treatments which do have a role in pain management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government should be ashamed of its record when it comes to giving access to medicinal cannabis. For many years, we've seen people who have championed this cause—people like Dan and Lucy Haslam, who had to lobby the government about the unbearable suffering caused by Dan's chemotherapy. Dan had bowel cancer. He was having chemotherapy. He had nausea and it wasn't relieved by a range of anti-nausea agents. Medicinal cannabis was the only thing that provided him with some relief to allow him to continue to eat and have some quality of life while he was receiving treatment. Sadly, Dan has since passed away. Of course, the great tragedy is that, even if Dan were still alive, he would not be able to have a consistent legal supply of medicinal cannabis to ease his suffering—even now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Several years ago, the Greens decided that we needed some action here. We introduced the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill, which was cross-party legislation. It was a clear example of how the community, working together with their parliamentary representatives—and, of course, the Greens were front and centre in that change—allowed us to put pressure on the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, rather than accepting this as the most logical and rational approach to how we regulate cannabis—that is, to create a separate body to deal with many of the issues that are unique to medicinal cannabis—gave us their Narcotic Drugs Amendment Bill. That has effectively been a regulatory nightmare. People have to jump through hoops. There are so many obstacles that one needs to pass before one can get access to medicinal cannabis. You only need to look at the number of people right now who are being prescribed medicinal cannabis by their medical practitioner, which is only several hundred, to know that this scheme isn't working. The TGA medicinal cannabis experiment has failed, and we need a new approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this parliament gave the government the benefit of the doubt when they said that they were serious about reform in this area. Instead, we've got this disaster of overregulation and red tape and the continuation of an ideology that stops people from getting access to this treatment. We've tried to modify the government's proposal. In fact, we've done it through a disallowance motion. Indeed, we were successful in our disallowance motion, through the Medicinal Cannabis Legislation Amendment (Securing Patient Access) Bill 2017, in the Senate last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to remind the Senate that it was Senator Hanson and One Nation who voted against that piece of legislation when it was put before the parliament. That was legislation that would have given compassionate access to people who needed medicinal cannabis. Of course, I'm pleased that after the Greens had that vote recommitted—thanks to former Senator Jacqui Lambie, who made it clear that she had been unable to vote on that legislation—One Nation changed their position and we were successful in getting that disallowance through the Senate. We have continued to advocate for a process that removes barriers to access to medicinal cannabis under Special Access Scheme category A, ending the duplication in the regulatory process and ensuring that clinicians are informed. But the bottom line is we need to overhaul the system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll support this urgency motion, but, sadly, this is a motion that gives patients false hope. Even if this motion does pass, it won't have any effect. What we need to do is have this government change the law. That is the only way we'll start to see people getting access to medicinal cannabis. It's so clear that the only model is to create an independent pathway—one that's separate from the TGA—that says, 'If you are suffering from a terminal illness, indeed, if you are suffering from a range of other conditions for which the evidence base is clear, then a doctor will be able to prescribe you this medication, because we know it's effective and we know it works.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HINCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  I support what the previous speakers have said. I suspect I'm probably the only person in this place who has been to medicinal cannabis conferences at Nimbin for the past two years. I never though I would be saying this, but I appreciate it that Senator Hanson, although she did vote against it, is now voting with us. I think she had been spooked by a last-minute scare that was sent through the government from the health minister at that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I won't go over all the old ground. I do agree with Senator Di Natale: the government has to change its law. We've got cannabis oil companies on the stock exchange. We've got the Victorian government supporting marijuana being grown in Victoria. I've had to forward a plan that Norfolk Island should become like Tasmania and do with medical marijuana what they do with poppies in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you're in Nimbin you talk to people, you hear other cases. I talked to a woman whose daughter had 900 epileptic convulsions. She has to risk criminal prosecution to get oil for her child. I met a man in Nimbin, an elderly man with brain cancer, who risks criminal prosecution to get access to that product. That is why it is wrong. It is time for us to change. The government has been obstructionist. We did get disallowance motions through, but they are not following the spirit of the Senate. They are not following through with the spirit of the law. They don't care about people who are desperately in need of this treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the last things I did before I jumped the shark was a big story on medicinal cannabis on a Sunday night television program. Some of the stories there were absolutely horrifying. I plead with the government and I plead with the health minister: go and look at that story. Go back there and see the sorts of cases we had of people and their children suffering. I met one man in Nimbin who'd been to jail because he grew marijuana and made cannabis oil for his neighbour. He did time in jail for it. I plead with the government: stop being obstructionist. Get on with it and change the bloody law.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I present the 168th report of the Standing Committee of Privileges entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary privilege and the use of intrusive powers</span>, and I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the report be adopted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Privileges Committee has reported on the inquiry referred to it on 28 November 2016 into the intersection between parliamentary privilege and the use of intrusive powers by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. At the time the committee received this reference, it was conducting another inquiry into claims of parliamentary privilege over documents seized from a senator's office and the home of a staff member. The committee was also examining a possible contempt which had arisen in the execution of a search warrant. These are—and indeed were—very important matters and subject of a previous report of the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During this inquiry, the committee considered the powers that allow access to telecommunications data or metadata as well as other intrusive powers which enable agencies to, for example, enter and search premises and seize evidential material with a search warrant, intercept live communications and conduct other electronic surveillance, and access stored and other communications and data. The committee also examined the oversight mechanisms established to ensure that such powers are exercised properly and whether the agencies using those powers are maintaining records in accordance with the law. Key questions included: what, if any, recognition is given to the work of parliamentarians, and whether claims of parliamentary privilege could be made, and, if so, how they could be resolved? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disturbingly, the evidence revealed no consideration of how questions of parliamentary privilege may be dealt with when intrusive powers are used, whether covert or not. In fact, the case presented was that the covert nature of intrusive powers meant that questions of parliamentary privilege were not considered to be relevant. The thinking seems to be that what is not seen or heard cannot possibly give rise to an improper interference with the work of the parliament and, therefore, a possible contempt. The Privileges Committee is concerned that this stems from the view that parliamentary privilege is limited simply to the 'use' immunity, which guarantees that the testimony of a witness will not be used against them as evidence in a court, rather than the clearly established systems of powers and immunities that the Commonwealth parliament inherited from the House of Commons in 1901. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Law enforcement and intelligence agencies shared with the committee the importance of intrusive powers to their investigatory work and the need to preserve the flexibility and efficacy of their investigations. The committee acknowledged that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also the suggestion that parliamentarians not be considered either above the law or immunised from the attention of foreign powers. The committee notes that the inquiry was not a reference to expand the powers and immunities of the parliament, which are jointly referred to as parliamentary privilege, but the committee did consider the purpose of parliamentary privilege, which is to enable the parliament to effectively carry out its functions. In the words of <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers' Australian Senate Practice</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The primary functions of the Senate are to inquire, to debate and to legislate, and any analysis of parliamentary privilege must be related to the way in which it assists and protects those functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Australian Federal Police expressed some scepticism regarding the potential for its exercise of intrusive powers to have a chilling effect on the work of the parliament, the President of the New South Wales Legislative Council submitted that there was good cause to believe that any such covert powers had the potential to curtail the free and ready flow of information to members and the issues of privilege that may arise. The Australian Federal Police also argued that its use of covert intrusive powers is subject to robust oversight and accountability mechanisms, including external scrutiny by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, but the Ombudsman advised that it does not consider the implications of parliamentary privilege in performing its statutory compliance audits of law enforcement agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee concluded that the lawful use of intrusive powers can have a chilling effect on the work of this parliament. Parliamentary privilege does not diminish because of the mechanism used to access material. How material related to the work of a parliamentarian is accessed should not determine whether parliamentary privilege exists. It is clear to the committee that this view is not held by those involved in using intrusive powers, whether covertly or otherwise, and so the Privileges Committee, therefore, examined possible remedies to this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee sought a clear process for claims of parliamentary privilege to be made and assessed when such powers are used while at the same time allowing the investigation of serious criminal and intelligence matters to continue unimpeded. The committee examined the existing 2005 memorandum of understanding between the executive and the parliament, and the national guideline it underpins. These documents set out the processes to be followed by the Australian Federal Police when it seeks to execute a search warrant on premises occupied or used by a parliamentarian, including the Parliament House office, electorate office and residence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee concluded that the memorandum of understanding provides a useful template and recommends that the Presiding Officers, in consultation with the executive, develop extra protocols that will set out agreed processes to be followed by law enforcement and intelligence agencies when exercising intrusive and other investigative powers. The effect of the motion I have moved today is for the Senate to adopt the committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's consideration of the memorandum of understanding also proved useful on another level, as it explored the issue of third-party assistance in the execution of search warrants. This was one amongst many new developments in this space. The Australian Federal Police gave evidence that the recent experience where a third party assisted in the execution of a search warrant, and the possible improper interference that occurred, was because the national guideline had not envisaged that such assistance might occur. The Australian Federal Police supported updating the national guideline to address the use of constables or third parties assisting in the execution of search warrants. The committee agrees and suggests that, until the necessary consultations to amend the national guideline can occur, the matter be dealt with administratively. If no other senator wishes to speak at this time, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted; debate adjourned.</span>

I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report, entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Number of women in Australia who have had transvaginal mesh implants and related matters</span>, is about the women who have been affected by transvaginal mesh implants. Let me say at the outset that not every woman who has had a transvaginal mesh implant has had the severe consequences that a large number of women we heard about have had—I acknowledge that—but, for the women who have been affected, it has had life-changing and lifelong consequences. I want to say right from the start: it's those women who are at the heart of this report. Those women have suffered for too long. They have been ignored and they have been treated badly. It is essential that we acknowledge that they have been treated appallingly. They have suffered for so long without being heard. They have not been believed. In some cases, they've been belittled. They have been ignored. Well, for no longer shall they be ignored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would particularly like to thank all the women who have shared their experiences. Sometimes they felt embarrassment and shame. They articulated this to us. I thank them from the bottom of my heart for sharing their experiences with us. I'd like to share a quote from a woman who did not want to be named, but you'll find this quote in the report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For those reading this they are words on paper or on an electronic device, but for those of us living with mesh, and especially those that have suffered complications, they aren't words, but physical pain, emotional trauma, fear, embarrassment, ridicule, shame, disbelief, depression, anxiety, derision, and aloneness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, having heard the evidence we received, that sums it up. I hope that we never have to have another inquiry where we see such suffering from the witnesses—women who literally could not sit down for very long. They wanted to be at the hearings for the whole day to bear witness to what others have experienced and to give us their evidence. Many of them could not sit down for very long, so we saw them having to get up and sometimes leaning against a wall. Some had to bring in special cushions to sit on during the hearing. I never want to see women going through that experience again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge Senator Hinch, who worked so hard on this, and the other senators who also worked so hard on achieving a consensus report and the 13 recommendations that we made. We want to see them implemented so that other women don't have to go through what so many have had to go through. Women who have had adverse outcomes from these procedures, with devices that were put in for stress urinary incontinence or for pelvic organ prolapse, commonly known as POP, have been failed in a monumental way by the system and, I've got to say, by certain people in the medical profession whom they trusted and thought would give them the best advice possible and would carry out the procedure in a way that was world's best practice. It is my belief that the medical profession needs to acknowledge that some mistakes were made and that there were problems. That was acknowledged during the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I must say, as an aside, that an email I got recently because of a comment I had made about some people in the medical profession in relation to mesh indicates to me that we still have some way to go for some people in the medical profession to acknowledge that mistakes do happen and were made here. The committee recommends that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… treatment guidelines developed by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care should clearly indicate that—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and this is the really important bit—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">transvaginal mesh implantation should only be undertaken with fully informed consent and as a last resort when other treatment options have been properly considered and determined unsuitable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some instances where we were told that these sorts of implants should be used as a last resort, we had clear evidence that that in fact did not happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the inquiry, the TGA made some very important announcements and decisions relating to these transvaginal mesh implants. They determined that devices should not be used for POP, pelvic organ prolapse, that the use of these procedures should be limited and that it should be ensured that patients had patient cards for devices. One of the issues that we were supposed to deal with through this inquiry was to find out exactly how many women in Australia have had transvaginal mesh implants and how many had had adverse consequences. But we can't answer that question, because the data hasn't been collected. We can't tell you exactly how many women have had these implants and how many women have had adverse consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the committee made 13 recommendations, including recommendations that relate to adverse event reporting. The reason that we can't tell you how many women have had adverse consequences is that they don't collect the data and the definition of 'adverse consequences' is open to interpretation. There's no mandatory reporting. These are the sorts of issues that we say need to be addressed. We also say that there needs to be a registry of high-risk devices. While there's a specific registry of implantable devices, there's not a registry for transvaginal mesh, which is now a high-risk device. We also had issues around the training of doctors and surgeons that were doing the implant surgery and the credentialing in hospitals of the doctors and surgeons implanting such devices. We need to address that particular issue. There also needs to be an audit done of how many devices are out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, I would like to again acknowledge the women who told us of their personal experiences, women who have been living with the pain and the consequences of the implantation of these devices. A number of women expressed very strongly the impact that this device and having this surgery have had on them and their families—for example, the splitting up of families and the loss of partners who just couldn't cope with the stress and the impact it has had. This should never have happened. We need to fix it. We need to provide support for these women who have been affected. It's going to affect some women for the rest of their lives, and that support needs to be given. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the secretariat who, as usual in our committee, have gone above and beyond. They have produced an excellent report and they've done excellent work in circumstances that were, in some instances, highly emotional, in making sure that we honoured the women who gave us their evidence and very personal accounts in very trying circumstances. I thank them for sharing their experiences.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HINCH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:44</span>):  Fifteen months ago, in November 2016, in one of my first adjournment speeches in this place, I talked about a procedure that many people in here, and millions of people out there, had never heard of. Even the few in the media who had were embarrassed to talk about it or report it, because it included the word 'vagina', as in transvaginal mesh. It was so non-U and so non-PC to talk about it that, when I submitted a notice of motion to the Senate for this public inquiry, another senator suggested I censor the term 'transvaginal' and call it 'pelvic' mesh—more palatable, apparently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With public hearings all around the country last year, and with valuable contributions from the UK and New Zealand, we now know a heck of a lot more about this scandal. I think today, as we table our committee's long-anticipated report, it is worthwhile going back to November 2016 and some of the things that I said back then. I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Back in the 1950s and 1960s there was a morning sickness pill that women around the world were innocently taking. And they started giving birth to babies with no arms or legs. After an Australian doctor, William McBride, started making the connection between Thalidomide and deformed babies, drugs like Distaval were taken off the market and a shocked world asked: how could it have gone on so long? How could the drug companies in Australia have known for so many months and put so many pregnancies at risk? How could they put money before morality? Profit before pain? How could our medical authorities and health protection agencies have been so ignorant and so complacent? Thalidomide became a dirty word.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a new four-letter word that's in the same category, a word for something that is not crippling babies but has crippled thousands of mothers both here and overseas—in fact, hundreds of thousands of mothers, we have discovered, around the world, in Australia, in New Zealand, in the United States, in Scotland, in Europe. The word, as you know now, is 'mesh'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, the drug companies and the so-called watchdogs like the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, have let victims down and are letting victims down. For about 20 years, this plastic or polypropylene mesh has been permanently embedded as postnatal hammocks, slings, netting, for prolapsed organs and stress incontinence—a so-called miracle treatment for male incontinence too. The mesh is meant to be chemically inert. Before any implanted device gets clearance from the FDA in the US, there must be guarantees that it is inert, is safe, won't change after contact with tissue fluids in the body, won't produce allergic reactions, won't incite inflammation, won't trigger your immune system, won't harbour and breed bacteria, and, crucially, will stay anchored wherever in the body it is installed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, painfully, dangerously, transvaginal mesh does not pass those tests. We discovered that at our public hearings in Perth, Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. To make the nightmare worse, these mesh hammocks are anchored deep in the thigh, the buttocks, the pelvic region, in muscles where nerves grow through the mesh, making it almost impossible to remove when things go wrong—like a wire netting fence getting overgrown with creeper in the backyard. It gets worse, as you will discover if you read our lengthy and comprehensive report. Over time this 'harmless' plastic netting can become brittle and start to break away in shards and splinters that start to float around the body, causing inflammation and excruciating pain. No wonder these slings have been called torture devices. There have been cases where a splinter has pierced a woman's vaginal wall and injured her partner during intercourse, and a large percentage of the relationships of these women have broken down. This was explicitly and starkly illustrated in some of the brave personal stories—mentioned by Senator Siewert—that many victims emotionally outlined to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder some of these mesh products have been banned in Scotland and now here in Australia, for some operations, and across the ditch in NZ. No wonder there are nearly 100,000 lawsuits pending in the United States and some lawsuits here. Some crippled Australian women have taken out loans, or increased their mortgage, to cover the $35,000 or $40,000 cost of the removal operation overseas, because no Australian surgeons are really qualified to attempt total removals. I have now met and talked to heaps of women from all over this country who have suffered interminable pain, and physical and mental breakdowns, because of these implants. Some—many—have thought that suicide was the only solution. I hope that our report convinces them that they have been listened to and, more importantly, they have been believed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to remember: having first been told there was only a one per cent chance of an adverse reaction, they have since been treated like mushrooms: kept in the dark and fed bullshit by doctors, hospital administrators, the drug companies and, sadly, even the TGA. At times, they've almost been convinced to believe that their pain and debilitating conditions were psychosomatic or, some were told, just a way to get more painkillers—and many GPs actually suggested that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go back to two victims' stories, although there are dozens of excruciating personal horror stories in our report. One is from Caz Chisholm. She started an online support group for transvaginal-mesh-injured women. What triggered my interest back in 2016, when she and Kim Blieschke flew from Perth and Port Pirie to Melbourne to meet me, was this description. She had written to me overnight:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These devices are in a woman's pelvis until she dies! We have been fighting tooth and nail for a suspension on mesh until an investigation is carried out but the doors have been closed on us and we believe that a Senate inquiry is the only way we are going to get to the truth of this situation. Transvaginal mesh damage is a worldwide problem and Australia is lagging in providing the help that women need to get their mesh devices out. There are only a few renowned surgeons in the world who can fully remove them. We need one of the surgeons to come to Australia to remove the devices for the women who are desperate to get them out. The pain is so excruciating for some that suicide has become a normal thought to ease the burden of living with the suffering for the rest of their life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can say to Caz: you got your inquiry, and I know this is just the start, not the denouement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was this bit, early on, from another victim, Toni Shannon:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I seriously cannot believe that from one innocent minor day surgery and under the trust of surgeon and the experts of the Australian medical system, that I am left with a permanent disability. I am unable to return to work as I cannot sit, stand, walk or drive for more than five minutes without excruciating pain</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From the prime of my life I became crippled in less than three months. Thankfully, a world-renowned mesh removal surgeon from the USA removed my faulty and recalled product.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I now have severe incontinence, nevertheless, this is the least of my worries. Worse is that I am made to feel like a criminal by my insurance company because their doctor and our government do not believe that mesh causes these types of injuries. It has left me suicidal and abandoned. In this day and age, and in our country, I can't believe that this is happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She asked a question that we have tried to get answers to. That question, from a crippled victim: why would the TGA allow it, why would surgeons implant it and why is a permanent and life-threatening device put into a woman's body for a non-life-threatening problem such as incontinence? The foreign body mesh placed through the vagina cannot be safely removed and it is guaranteed to pick up bacteria, which will fester and create a biofilm, erosion, nerve and organ damage et cetera. She says it's not like a pacemaker, which can be implanted and then easily removed if there's a reaction or a fault. She says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">None of us were warned that removal of mesh is pretty much impossible. Few of us were warned that it was polypropylene. None of us were warned that there were over 100,000 legal cases against mesh and warnings throughout the world. None of us were tested for allergy or reaction to polypropylene before surgery. Most of us were only offered mesh as a treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They were offered no alternatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard case histories and about some of the side effects: things like infection, bleeding, painful sexual intercourse, vaginal scarring, prolapse return, sepsis, immune system rejection, urinary problems, chronic pain—it went on and on and on. And there is the pain of daily living: stabbing pains when sitting on the toilet; stabbing pains when crawling into bed, when you're walking, when you're sitting at a desk. It truly is a national disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was not exaggerating back in 2016 when I compared transvaginal mesh to thalidomide. This is one of the greatest medical scandals and abuses of mothers in our country's history. I said back then: 'I fervently believe a Senate inquiry is a must. We have to do it.' I thank Senator Siewert and the Community Affairs References Committee for letting me hijack them for this inquiry, and I thank the secretariat for such a comprehensive, if at times frightening, report. Personally, I believe that mesh using polypropylene should be banned for most, if not all, operations like POP and most stress incontinence treatments. At best, it should be used only as a last resort. I know now, after this year-long inquiry, that when I spoke about transvaginal mesh and thalidomide in the same breath in this chamber, I was wrong. Mesh is far, far worse. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tabling of this final report of the inquiry into crystal methamphetamine is the culmination of three years of work by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. Over the course of the inquiry, the committee has spent time with a diverse range of communities from Mt Gambier to Caboolture. We listened to communities tell their stories and their desperate need for treatment and family support. The committee's first report was handed down in September 2017 and focused on the role of law enforcement in drug strategies. This final report focuses on the importance of rehabilitation and treatment services. Our regional and rural communities are not only at greater risk but lack the resources to educate and rehabilitate their own. Particular stories have struck me—parents who are desperate for the opportunity to help their children and parents who have lost their sons or daughters. Visiting St Vincent's Hospital in both Melbourne and Sydney, we heard of the impact on emergency services and front-line staff—the increased violence and new issues which are arising from a growing rate of users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyday Australians see the devastating impact of methamphetamine use and feel powerless to help. We cannot be blind to the fact that supply has not diminished and that new illicit synthetic drugs will continue to appear. How we respond to the current situation is critically important in order to support our community in the foreseeable future. Fundamental to these recommendations, therefore, is adequate, stable, long-term funding that creates lasting partnerships and reliable access to treatment. Long waiting lists for treatment services are exacerbating our community's ability to help their own. Our regional and rural communities feel the brunt of this, with many witnesses expressing frustration at waiting lists and delays in receiving that adequate treatment. Drug treatment services themselves are stretched throughout Australia. That is why the committee has recommended strengthening these services with funding to increase capacity and equitable access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Harm reduction is an important part of an integrated National Drug Strategy and of critical long-term strategies across the board to minimise the impact of drug and alcohol abuse. The reality in Australia is that harm has not been reduced but has rather increased. Along with an increase in supply, it shows that current policies in this country are not working. So, despite this inquiry being conducted by our law enforcement committee, we argue that a law enforcement approach alone is not the answer to this problem. We must address the cause and not just the symptoms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the evidence from Dr Alex Wodak revealed, the most important strategy to reduce methamphetamine related problems in Australia is by expanding the capacity and improving the quality of treatment. Our committee recommendations recognise this. They emphasise appropriate treatment, funding and the need for a national quality framework for alcohol and other drug treatment services, including public not-for-profit and for-profit residential rehabilitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also recommend that the Commonwealth government refer to the Productivity Commission an inquiry into the costs and benefits of the National Drug Strategy as currently implemented. The current policy is not working. The Commonwealth, state and territory governments need to rebalance alcohol and other drug funding across the three pillars of the National Drug Strategy—supply, demand and harm reduction strategies. To ensure investment is weighted towards reducing harm minimisation, an analysis of the shortfalls of the current policy is required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a committee, we learnt that successful strategies are contingent on the relationships built between health workers, law enforcement, education providers and the community. These relationships are critical to ensuring that individuals are diverted before becoming addicted or receive timely relevant information and treatment. That is why the committee very much supports drug courts, which exist in some states around Australia, and their role in drug diversionary schemes. These schemes move people away from incarceration to give them a chance to address their drug problem. Public awareness campaigns also play a pivotal role. But we recommend that these engender compassion towards drug users and target and inform those people, with the objective of encouraging them to seek treatment and support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lessons can be learnt from the national HIV campaign and the media guidelines about suicide. The implementation of the Australian Press Council's standards provides an excellent model for governments and media agencies to develop appropriate and compassionate coverage of drug related content. Government messaging and media coverage, if implemented effectively, could significantly reduce the harm associated with the use of crystal methamphetamine by promoting that drug users seek treatment—rather than simplistic and punitive messaging that stigmatises individuals and prevents them from seeking treatment. We must break down the stigma.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Acknowledging that the current policies are not working despite government funding in this space, the committee, as I said, recommends that the Commonwealth government refer to the Productivity Commission an inquiry into the cost and benefits of the current policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee also visited Portugal. That provided an invaluable insight into how a country's decriminalised framework has improved drug users' health and saved lives. Whilst the committee has not reached a concluded view about a decriminalised approach for methamphetamine, it is worth noting the number of countries that have adopted a decriminalised framework for drug use and also what has been done in some Australian states and territories to decriminalise cannabis use and possession.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventeen years ago, Portugal decided to stop persecuting drug users and addicts and decriminalised all forms of drugs when people are caught with a small amount. Instead, users are only punishable under administrative law, not criminal law, giving them a fine for recreational use, for example, instead of a jail sentence. If they are an addict, they would be encouraged to subscribe to a government funded treatment program, which was free and readily available. For me, the most enlightening factor of Portugal's change of policy was that it meant that drug users should, above all, not be labelled and marginalised and it focused instead on the state approaching addicts to encourage them to seek treatment. It was a complete breakdown of the stigma that prevents drug users from coming forward to seek treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there's a misconception about decriminalisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst Portugal decriminalised drugs for users, it was not legal to sell drugs. Dealers and traffickers are still sent to jail, and dealing and trafficking remains a criminal offence. Drugs are still illegal in Portugal, but what it does is separate out addiction, so it can be managed through the health system, whilst handling the distribution of drugs through the judicial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In accepting that the war on drugs has not worked, and in accepting that drug use needs to be regarded as a health issue, I believe removing criminal sanctions for personal drug use and possession must be considered by all levels of government in future policy development. In fact, that was the approach adopted last week by the respected policy think tank Australia21. A round table of experts on drug policy highlighted how Australia's existing drug policy approach has failed to meet its own expectations and how poor drug policy leads to further crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this highlights that we do need serious drug law reform in Australia because, as our report highlights, the current approach in Australia is simply not working. If decriminalisation were to be seriously considered, then I think an approach, like the Portuguese approach, of appointing an expert panel to develop a strategy to improve health outcomes for Australian drug users would be an excellent example. When former law enforcement officers and former law enforcement agencies are saying that Australia cannot arrest its way out of the methamphetamine problem, then we must accept that a change in policy is necessary. In the words of Mick Palmer, the former AFP Commissioner:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Australians are fundamentally very decent and caring people. But to achieve the changes and improvements so desperately needed to our illicit drugs policy we must find ways to cause people to confront, identify and deal with the reality and to recognise the causes, not simply the symptoms. As part of this process we must be prepared to unashamedly tug at people's heart strings in order to change their minds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that this report, which is the culmination of three years work, provides a way towards changing people's minds and achieving a better drug policy for this country. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has landed a unanimous report on the life insurance industry. The life insurance industry plays a critical role in the lives of everyday Australians. Pricing risk is a fundamental and necessary dimension of life insurance, particularly to make sure that life insurance remains viable and sustainable. Life insurance must also serve its purpose. Risk is spread across an entire pool of individuals. What has become clear through the course of the committee's proceedings is that, at the moment, the type and extent of information accessed by life insurers to assess risk has a potential to reach a point whereby insurance is no longer serving its purpose. More than this, the type and extent of information accessed by life insurers is causing individuals to trade off financial stability, which could be secured through life insurance, against their health, whether through an insurer's broad ability to access medical information, an insurer's misuse of information on an individual's mental health experience or an insurer's discrimination against individuals who have undertaken potentially life-saving genetic testing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any role life insurers have that undermines the health-seeking behaviours of Australians cannot remain. Currently, many limitations and barriers exist around access to health treatment, particularly around mental health. Once an individual steps forward to seek help, they need to access appropriate services, and do so in a timely manner. Life insurers are presenting an additional barrier. We need to manage the reality that those who take proactive steps to better health cannot continue to be locked out of the life insurance market and dissuaded from taking positive health action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report has achieved a sensible balance for the benefit of Australians more broadly, and for the life insurance industry as well. During the inquiry, we learnt that by simply ticking a box Australians making a claim for life insurance can provide their entire medical history, sometimes inadvertently, to their insurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This includes intimate details about any health issue they have ever had, including information that may not be relevant to their claim. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners estimated that entire medical records are provided in around half of the cases. Very concerningly, we learnt that some life insurers could not even tell us how many complete medical records they had in their possession. The RACGP's Dr Seidel expressed that—and I don't think he could have put it any more clearly—'a patient's medical record is not a tradeable commodity'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The practice of assessing whole medical records is not sustainable. It impacts on health outcomes for patients. In response to the concern that patients may be at risk of insurers misusing the information that they receive, doctors are now under recording information that their patients provide to them. The tone and the language of the current FSC code do not reflect assertions by the industry that full medical records are rarely required. Again, individuals should not have to trade off financial sustainability that could be secured through life insurance for their health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the proceedings it also became evident that insurers do not know what to do about mental health. The issue of access to mental health services is a very significant one. Access to life insurance if you've ever had a mental ill-health experience is even worse. Not only do denials occur but insurers are applying unnecessarily broad exclusions. For instance, a mother who has experienced postnatal depression could have a complete mental health exclusion applied to her insurance policy. A period of situational mental ill-health, such as an episode of depression occurring from grief, should not be treated by insurers in the same way as schizophrenia or bipolar. These practices, however, continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that not all mental health problems persist into adulthood. Mental ill-health can be situational and episodic, but some life insurers are not appreciating this in any way. They rely on outdated mental health stereotypes. Many of them are bringing together work stress, anxiety, depression and schizophrenia without appreciating the full spectrum of mental health challenges. This has to change. The signal that denial of life insurance sends is in very significant contrast to our public health message of hope and recovery. We need to encourage people to seek treatment, not to avoid it because of insurance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the loss of financial stability, fear of refusal of insurance is causing real cost to the health of Australians, including our young people. The committee received evidence that fearful parents are doing anything they can to avoid their children getting mental health notes recorded because the parents are concerned about the insurance implications for those young people later in life. This is very concerning given that 75 per cent of mental illness will be diagnosed by the age of 25 and 50 per cent will be known by the age of 14.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerns about mental health exclusions were initially raised with me by tradies and small business owners on the Central Coast who had experienced a period of mental ill-health and were then denied income protection vital for the financial security of their families and businesses. But it's much more broadly spread than just for income protection. Nearly half of the Australian adult population will experience a mental illness at some point of their life and less than half will access treatment. Let's be clear. The insurance industry has been part of the reason Australians are choosing not to seek help for mental ill-health. It is simply untenable that people are avoiding mental health care due to the fear of discrimination. It's undermining collective efforts by dedicated individuals, organisations and governments to improve the health and wellbeing of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, evidence was presented that life insurers are impacting people's desire to undertake potentially life-saving genetic testing. Evidence presented to the committee indicated that an individual's genetic information can be used by insurers to charge a higher premium, exclude insurance cover for certain conditions or deny insurance entirely. This has occurred even in instances where individuals have taken proactive steps to reduce the likelihood of having a certain condition. Currently, we know that genetic tests vary in accuracy and quality, and in some instances they are conducted without health professionals. Interpretation of results can be the subject of debate amongst clinicians, let alone amongst insurers, yet life insurers treat all results in the same manner and are arbitrarily dealing with diagnosis, not with prognosis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The misuse of genetic information by life insurers has meant that some Australians are not undertaking the BRCA gene or Lynch syndrome tests, for instance. These tests could allow these Australians to mitigate or avoid the onset of symptoms. The treatment of genetic information by life insurers has consequences beyond Australians not undertaking the tests themselves. This is very concerning. It is impacting research around public health and preventative methods. Some individuals are not participating in research trials because of concerns about discrimination by life insurers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to close with a few necessary acknowledgments. Can I thank the chair, Steve Irons, the Liberal and Labor senators who participated in this inquiry and Senator Whish-Wilson. I'd particularly like to thank Matt Keogh, Terri Butler and Senator Ketter from the Labor team—together we worked really hard to get a great outcome here. Can I also acknowledge the excellent work of the secretariat, led by Patrick Hodder, and also John Bell for bringing this report together. It was a long process, and it took a lot of dedication. I'd also like to thank the life insurers, the advocacy groups, the people from the mental health sector and the geneticists who gave us the benefit of their considerable knowledge. I hope that this report will play a significant role in revitalising the insurance industry and that the steps we've recommended will go to improving the quality of the experience of life insurance for Australians. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I present the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee on cyberbullying, together with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee, and I move:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking to this report very briefly this afternoon, I want to highlight to the Senate the significant impacts and distress caused by cyberbullying on many vulnerable Australians. Be they young people or adults, the distress and disruption to people's lives has significant mental health impacts, and there are not as yet sufficient remedies for people to address this kind of harassment. We've seen, in recent days, big debates about the lack of duty of care of companies like Facebook in relation to people's data. But I want to say that is not where their duty of care should end. Duty of care should relate not only to privacy and safety of data but also to people's online conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, we've made strong recommendations about social media in this nation. The definition needs to be broadened because currently not enough media platforms are captured by it. Duty of care is a real issue in terms of people's conduct inside those platforms. There's not very much difference between a shopping centre, a workplace or other places where duty of care is expected, so there should be a greater onus on our social media companies to ensure that people conduct themselves inside those platforms in a manner that is free from the kind of bullying and harassment that is unacceptable online and unacceptable elsewhere in the community. The extraordinary harassment faced by people, particularly women, people of disability, LGBTI people and other people with characteristics that might make them vulnerable, is just extraordinary and cannot go unaddressed by this nation. The Office of eSafety Commissioner gave terrific evidence, but, sadly, their powers are limited by the fact that they can only issue take-down notices for children. The committee recommends that those powers be expanded.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to say thanks to the witnesses that gave evidence to our committee, in particular the very brave women, including those from the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children, Van Badham, Sonya Ryan and Women in Media. It is absolutely critical that we hear their stories, and I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Foreign Media Ownership and Community Radio) Bill 2017, questions arose about the right to privacy and whether, in the circumstances, civil penalty provisions should be accompanied by criminal trial safeguards - however more information was needed to finalise this assessment. Following a response from the minister, it was assessed that adequate safeguards will be in place to sufficiently circumscribe limitations on the right to privacy. The further information also clarified the particular regulatory context and intended application of the civil penalties, enabling the committee to conclude that they were unlikely to be considered 'criminal' for the purposes of international human rights law.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to the national security espionage and foreign interference bill, information requested from the Attorney-General about proposed amendments addressed a number of issues going to compliance with Australia's international human rights obligations, though some concerns remain. The Attorney-General also foreshadowed the potential for further amendments - the committee has requested a copy of these and supported the Attorney-General's suggestion for a 5‑year review of the operation of relevant provisions.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  I present the report of the Senate Economics References Committee on foreign bribery together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I wish to thank a number of people, including former Senators Xenophon and Wang for moving the motion to establish the inquiry. I particularly thank the witnesses and the people who gave submissions. Forty-six submissions were received. There were three hearings, and I thank those witnesses who came along. I want to thank the secretariat for their hard work in preparing the 213-page report, which I think will make a significant contribution to public policy in this area of foreign bribery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned in the report, foreign bribery impedes economic development, corrodes good governance and undermines the rule of law. Appropriately addressing foreign bribery is essential to cultivating integrity in all areas of government, business and community. There are clear moral problems with bribery, but it should not be forgotten that such activities hamper productivity here and abroad. If people and firms operating in an economy believe that there are ways to circumvent the rule of law, it destroys trust and economic activity and leaves us all worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The picture in Australia when it comes to foreign bribery reveals that there is some movement but at a snail's pace. The government appears to have taken a minimalist approach to the issue that does not go nearly far enough. What became clear during the inquiry was there had been very little enforcement action and very few actual prosecutions. It took considerable research to delve into the various reasons for why this has been the case. Australia's historically poor record in investigating and prosecuting foreign bribery matters has also affected its international reputation. I have said previously in the media that I am concerned that stakeholders see Australia as a soft touch on this matter. International bodies such as the OECD, as well as Australian commentators, have consistently criticised Australia's foreign bribery legislation for being too narrow in scope and inadequately enforced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of aspects of the report I would speak to, but I note we are very short of time. The one issue I do want to highlight is the strong evidence in favour of abolishing the facilitation payment defence. This is one of the more conceptually complex issues arising from Australia's anti-foreign-bribery legislation. Australian companies are taking matters into their own hands in choosing to prohibit such payments and should be commended for this, and many submitters talked about the removal of this particular defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of aspects to the report, but I won't deal with them at this point. Just to finish, the evidence in the report makes it clear that we can be doing more to stamp out foreign bribery. This report includes some sensible recommendations. I hope the government takes this report with the seriousness it deserves to stamp out this immoral and productivity-destroying activity. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted; debate adjourned.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government thanks the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth for its inquiry report into Australia's trade and investment relationship with Indonesia. The Committee's report contains valuable insights into how Australia can benefit from an enhanced trade relationship with Indonesia, particularly in the context of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) currently under negotiation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As the report notes, trade and investment is one element of the Australia-Indonesia bilateral relationship that has historically lagged behind the others. In 2016, Indonesia was only Australia's 13th largest trading partner - lower than New Zealand or Thailand, which have comparatively smaller economies. However, in line with Indonesia's rapidly developing economy, Australia is presented with an opportunity to strengthen the economic relationship to the significant benefit of both countries. The IA-CEPA is an important part of our efforts to make the most of this opportunity, including in areas such as healthcare, tourism, education and agricultural products.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The report's recommendations include that the Australian Government develop an information campaign to actively promote the business opportunities presented by the IA-CEPA. The Government supports this recommendation, and will engage with the private sector following finalisation of the agreement to ensure that Australian businesses are in a position to reap the benefits of its implementation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The report further recommends that the Government prioritises the development of infrastructure in Northern Australia to facilitate maritime, education and tourism services partnerships with Indonesia. The Government is fully cognisant of the need for greater investment in infrastructure in Northern Australia to benefit from its proximity to Asian markets. The potential benefits are outlined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Australia White Paper</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Australia Audit: Infrastructure for a Developing North</span> report from January 2015.</span>

It is difficult to accurately model the impact of changes to non-tariff barriers, trade facilitation, increased regulatory certainty and other rules-based aspects of trade agreements. Moreover, statistics on international trade in services and investment flows are incomplete.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The fiscal challenge for the Government is that HELP repayments have not kept pace with HELP lending growth. From 2010–11 to 2016–17, the level of new debt not expected to be repaid increased from 16 per cent to 25 per cent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a new minimum repayment income of $45,000 at which one per cent of income is repayable. The second threshold is $51,957 with a two per cent repayment rate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Each progressive threshold increases by six per cent income amounts and by 0.5 per cent increments in repayment rates, which smooths repayment obligations. Importantly, this new schedule of thresholds will also reduce incentive for debtors to "cluster" below thresholds to avoid repayments as they do now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are increased repayment rates for those earning the highest incomes, who are best placed to repay their debts sooner – with those earning $131,989 or more paying at ten per cent of their income.</span>

Currently, these debts are repaid concurrently with HELP debts but according to a subset of just three thresholds. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To improve rates of repayment of SFSS debts, and to achieve consistency in debt administration, the current three-tier threshold approach applied to SFSS repayments will be replaced with the full range of HELP thresholds. There will be a transitional year in 2018–19 that maintains the three-tier threshold arrangement while systems changes are implemented, and to allow these debtors additional time for transition.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 of the Bill also implements new indexation arrangements for the HELP repayment thresholds, which are currently indexed according to Average Weekly Earnings (AWE).</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For a number of years now, the HELP repayment thresholds have been rising relative to earnings. The higher growth in AWE has meant that people have dropped from a higher repayment threshold to a lower one, or have dropped out of the repayment stream altogether as the thresholds rise faster than their income growth. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill provides that the minimum and all subsequent thresholds will be indexed using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This will ensure repayment requirements are adjusted in line with the cost of living. It also streamlines indexation factors used throughout the <span style="font-style:italic;">Higher Education Support Act 2003</span>, as all amounts will be indexed in the same way.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment also reflects the National Commission of Audit's 2014 recommendation to improve the sustainability of HELP, in part, by indexing using this method.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 2019–20, when the full schedule of HELP thresholds will start to apply, old debts from SFSS will be repaid after HELP debts are discharged rather than concurrently.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new $150,000 loan limit for students undertaking medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses (as defined in the Act) is an increase on the estimated FEE-HELP limit of $130,552 for 2019. Students in these courses who had previously reached their FEE-HELP limit will, from 2019, have access to additional funds up to the new $150,000 limit. The new limit is considered more than sufficient to cover the Government‑subsidised tuition fees for these longer, and therefore more expensive courses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The combined lifetime loan limit is unlikely to present a financial obstacle for the vast majority of tertiary students, even if they undertake more than one course of study or undertake studies in both vocational education and higher education. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is because with the recently introduced VET student loans program, the Turnbull Government put in place loan caps on the amount of financial assistance available to be borrowed each year (from $5,075 up to a maximum of $15,225, depending on the course, for a year of full-time study in the 2018 academic year). </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new combined HELP tuition limit – from $104,440 to $150,000 – is more than adequate. In fact, it is sufficient to cover almost nine years of full-time study as a Commonwealth supported student in higher education — even in the most expensive courses. The loan limit is also sufficient to cover students who choose to undertake a mix of Commonwealth supported and fee-paying courses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To be clear, all new HECS-HELP borrowing will reduce a student's HELP balance – the amount that they can still borrow within the new lifetime loan limit. Previously accumulated HECS-HELP debt will not be counted but any new amounts deferred through a HECS-HELP loan from 1 January 2019 will count against a person's HELP balance.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms ensure our high quality higher education system can grow while meeting the global challenges it will increasingly face.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  Labor will not be supporting this amendment. This amendment would amend the legislation regarding the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. When the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Consumers First—Establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority) Bill 2017 was debated, Labor noted that the bill would unfortunately not make much difference in relation to the way banking disputes were handled. The average banking customer would not see much difference between the Financial Ombudsman Service and the government's Australian Financial Complaints Authority once it is established. We noted that, in relation to banking disputes, the bill was basically a rebadging exercise and the name 'authority' was a misnomer. This amendment seeks to include valuers, investigating accountants and receiver managers in the AFCA scheme. However, stakeholders, including the Institute of Public Accountants, in their reply to the Ramsey review, raised a number of technical issues with regard to including such third parties in the AFCA framework. While we cannot support this amendment today, we acknowledge concerns about the conduct of banks, which is why we have fought so hard for a royal commission.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  This amendment includes valuers, investigating accountants and receiver managers in the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, AFCA, scheme. Bank appointed valuers, investigating accountants and receiver managers act in a largely unsupervised environment. Misconduct in this sector has been raised in numerous past government and Senate inquiries. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has recommended changes, and so have various other inquiries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are serious about stopping white-collar and banking misconduct in Australia, we should support these changes, and we call for your support to do this with us. The problem is that the new AFCA, in its current form, will not investigate misconduct by bank appointed valuers, investigating accountants and receiver managers. The Financial Ombudsman Service, FOS, will not investigate cases of misconduct by valuers or accountants or receivers, even when the bank is aware that there has been misconduct. AFCA will be the same under the existing proposals. So, in some respects, it is a toothless tiger. As an example, I have a letter from FOS showing they will not investigate because, once the receiver is appointed, the receiver acts as an agent for the company and not the person who appointed it. In other words, the bank could appoint the most corrupt and incompetent receiver and be aware of misconduct and yet be totally unaccountable. The ombudsman cannot help unless the bank gives the regulator permission to investigate the crime. In the example submitted, Bankwest informed FOS that it is not prepared to waive the issues that may exist to enable a fresh dispute to be considered by FOS. So, if the bank wants to prevent an investigation, it can do so with a loophole in the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add insult to injury, if the damage caused by the misconduct is greater than the limit of FOS, it can fall outside the jurisdiction. This limit could encourage greater misconduct. To avoid investigation, a bank or the agent has to ensure that they create a level of damage above the limit. With the banking royal commission now underway and further cases of misconduct being exposed, now is the time to strengthen legislation and regulate this troubled industry. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has confirmed in discussions that there is very little regulation on these banks and appointed entities. They admit that, in some cases, receivers just refuse to provide details of their work to the owners of companies they are appointed over. They often charge hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for their work, with no accountability for what they have done. We have seen cases where receivers have employed the same lawyers the banks employed and then they act for the companies they are the receiver over—a conflict of interest in itself—and then they refuse to disclose to the owners and companies what the lawyers have done.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I refer to a letter from the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to Senator Jane Hume, Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, dated 29 September 2017. It reads: 'Despite the welcome step of establishing AFCA, we believe there are important considerations which are still missing from the jurisdiction of the proposed authority, namely the role of third party agents such as valuers, investigating accountants and receivers.' The ombudsman's inquiry report into small-business loans dated 12 December 2016 made a series of recommendations, including recommendation 13 that:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP have argued that these changes are unconstitutional. However, the Senate Procedure Office have said they can't see any constitutional problems with this amendment and they believe it is compatible with corporations law. Also under section 51, heads of power, banks, financial institutions and service providers are covered federally. We have run this by the Parliamentary Library. They have advised that our amendment is a solution to the issues raised by the ombudsman and they cannot see any constitutional reason why it can't work. The government objects to this amendment on the basis that it is unconstitutional. We have repeatedly asked the government to identify any reasons that this amendment may be unconstitutional and they have failed or refused to clarify these reasons. The only explanation can be that this amendment in fact is constitutional.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment needs to be supported if we want to help those affected by bank misconduct. Given the bank and receiver misconduct covered by numerous past government inquiries and the misconduct now being revealed by the banking royal commission, we request the Senate support the proposed constructive changes to bring this largely unregulated sector under control. This chamber should take the word of the Parliamentary Library, the ombudsman and the Senate Procedure Office ahead of a government who would rather protect their banking mates.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  Everyone has been calling for a royal commission into the banking sector, and the coalition government have actually instigated that. Labor say they've been calling for a royal commission into the banking sector, as have the Greens and One Nation and, I believe, Senator Hinch and others, and we were very pleased to see it happen. Now we are talking about the valuers and liquidators involved in this. In the Senate inquiry that One Nation had last year, it came out that they played a very big role in the devastation that shut down a lot of people in the farming sector who lost their properties, yet nothing was done about it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now proposing an amendment to include those people in this bill. We have confirmation that it can be done under this bill. If Labor are so much for all the battlers out there, why don't they want some accountability to ensure that these people are taken to task for their actions? Why aren't Labor prepared to stand up for this? This is an amendment that calls for accountability, so that they cannot just do what they want to do and destroy people's lives. The government, from the minister's office, is saying that this is unconstitutional. We have asked: which part of the Constitution? Absolute silence! Nothing has come back to us. They can make a comment like that, but they can't back it up with evidence.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They come under the Corporations Act—and that's fine—but there is no reason why either side cannot pass this amendment. Do you really want to stand up and ensure accountability in this country from the banking sector? They hire these liquidators and receivers. They don't pay for them, though; it's the people who are going under who have to pay the bills for this. They rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that's why people lose their properties. But you sit here in deafening silence and you're not prepared to make them accountability to the public. You sit there and say that you're for the battlers and you call for a royal commission into the banking sector. Is this Labor? Is this what you really want?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor constantly accuses One Nation of being out there grandstanding and not being prepared to stand up for the battlers and the farmers. Yet, here we are, moving an amendment to legislation that is going to be so beneficial to people in this country. It will make them accountable, and Labor just sits there and does absolutely nothing about it. You know who's really fighting for the people of this country, the battlers. It's One Nation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  I just want to note that the opposition will not be proceeding with amendment (1) on sheet 8382, dealing with the question of indigeneity. The government has wisely made the decision to omit the definition of 'Indigenous person' in the bill, on the basis that the administrative definition, as it's known, is the one that's widely used. I don't think there's much more I need to say in relation to that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the longer-term question of how Indigenous peoples want to be defined and how they want to be known—this is a matter that we should be consulting First Nations peoples about, rather than retaining the colonial process of attributing definitions to First Nations peoples that go way back to the old 'stud book', as it was called, or the various other ways in which derogatory language was used in relation to First Nations people. I'm not going to embark on a history lesson in relation to that tonight, but, as my colleague Senator Macdonald said earlier, there is a need for us as a parliament to come to terms with this and to engage with First Nations peoples on how they wish to be identified. Secondly, we have to remove the concept of race. It's a big exercise—I understand that—and a huge legacy, but, as a mature nation that seeks to uphold international standards, we ought to be moving further towards a recognition of the common nature of our humanity, rather than distinguishing people on the basis of race.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 1) Bill 2018. This bill deals with five relatively uncontroversial matters: an issue on regulatory reform, allowing the tax commissioner to pay certain superannuation amounts to individuals with a terminal medical condition; extending tax relief for merging superannuation funds; increasing the APRA levy to cover funding for SuperStream gateway governance; transferring responsibility for the early release of superannuation from the Department of Human Services to the Australian Taxation Office; and payment of GST on taxable supplies of certain real property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1, on regulatory reform, includes amending the superannuation laws to enable the tax commissioner to pay certain superannuation amounts directly to individuals with a terminal medical condition, rather than it needing to be paid to the fund, who then pays it to the person; amending the Corporations Act 2001 to modify the notification and reporting obligations applying to certain corporations that have property in receivership or property in respect of which a controller is acting; and repealing several inoperative acts as well as amending the taxation law to remove a number of inoperative or spent provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 relates to extending tax relief for merging superannuation funds. The transfer of assets from one super fund to another leads to the realisation of capital gains and/or capital losses. This can act as an obstacle to a superannuation fund merging with another fund, because the trustee has to take into account a potential reduction in the superannuation interests of its members when considering a merger. Through a series of government decisions, tax relief has been extended to merging funds since December 2008. This bill will extend the relief further, to 1 July 2020. The measure was announced by the government in the 2017-18 budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 will amend the APRA Act to enable the government to recover the ongoing costs of the governance of the superannuation transaction network SuperStream from the supervisory levy. It was Labor that first introduced SuperStream, following on from the 2010 Cooper review. SuperStream transmits money and information consistently across the superannuation system between employers, funds, service providers and the Australian Taxation Office. Before it existed, many transactions were processed manually, and the cost could be $5 or $10 a transaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowadays, over 80 million transactions a year are processed in a standardised digital form connecting around 800,000 employers, 200 APRA-regulated funds and 350,000 self-managed superannuation funds. SuperStream allows employers to make all their contributions in a single electronic transaction, including to multiple superannuation funds. It allows contributions and rollovers to be processed faster, more efficiently and with fewer errors. And it allows people to be more reliably linked to superannuation, reducing lost superannuation accounts and unclaimed money. The review conducted last year into SuperStream found that it had led to lower costs, ease of operation in the superannuation system and increased retirement savings. Members could now complete a rollover in three days, compared to an average 45 to 60 days previously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 to the bill transfers the regulator role for early release of superannuation benefits on compassionate grounds from the Chief Executive Medicare to the Commissioner of Taxation—that is, from the Department of Human Services to the ATO. Currently, the Department of Human Services has responsibility for early release of super. However, it does not administer any other program within the superannuation system and the program is not aligned with its core service delivery arrangements. The ATO administers several of the programs relating to the release of superannuation benefits. The transfer to the ATO is intended to build on this existing relationship and to streamline the process for the early release of superannuation benefits for both individuals and superannuation funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to schedule 5, which deals with phoenixing in development projects by amending the Taxation Administration Act 1953, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the GST act to require purchasers of new residential premises and new subdivisions of potential residential land to make a payment of part of the purchase price to the ATO. Currently, supplies of new residential premises are generally subject to GST. The supplier remits the GST to the ATO in the next BAS. This can be up to three months after settlement. The withholding tax being collected in this manner fits with existing conveyancing processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the main forms of noncompliance with these obligations involves developers selling properties for a purchase price that reflects the GST obligations but then dissolving their business before the next lodgement to avoid remitting the GST. This, of course, is a form of phoenixing. Phoenixing to avoid paying GST has grown significantly over the last decade. As at November 2017, the ATO had identified 3,731 individuals actively involved in this activity over the last five years. These individuals controlled over 12,000 insolvent entities responsible for $1.8 billion in debt that has been written off. These insolvent entities also claimed $1.2 billion of input tax credits between 2013 and 2017. The cost of phoenixing was estimated in 2012 at $3.2 billion annually. This is probably an underestimate. The government has received updated costs of phoenixing as at 2015 but has yet to publicly release them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleagues in the other place moved a second reading amendment that makes clear that the government has been lax in its action on phoenixing activity more generally. Labor announced in May last year that we would crackdown on dodgy directors through putting in place, among other things, a director identification number. Despite the government announcing that it would introduce a director identification number, we are yet to see the government take action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had a suite of organisations from across the political spectrum calling on this government to act urgently on a director identification number. When the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, the Productivity Commission, the Tax Justice Network, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Master Builders Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association, the Australian Institute of Credit Management, the Phoenix Project from the University of Melbourne's law school and Monash University's business school call upon the government to introduce a director identification number, you've got to wonder when they are finally going to act. If the Turnbull government had acted on director identification numbers when we called on them to do so in May last year, they would be law already and phoenix directors would no longer be engaged in the dodgy activity of burning their firms and hurting workers, taxpayers and honest small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we support the government's measures on phoenixing by developers to avoid GST, we urge them to go further and crack down on phoenix activity, as the Australian community demands, and reduce the cost of this to the community and the heartache that it imposes on workers, taxpayers and honest businesses.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="111206" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LEYONHJELM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 1) Bill 2018. There are few needs more fundamental than the need for shelter and housing, and we're all aware that it is becoming increasingly difficult for people in Australia to afford a new home. According to the 2018 Demographia survey, my home city of Sydney has been the second least affordable city in the world to buy a home for two years running. The median price for housing is 6.6 times the median wage, up from less than three times the median wage in the late 1980s. Even the most affordable region, Gladstone in Queensland, has housing 3.2 times the median wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A generation of first-time homebuyers is virtually locked out of the Sydney market, with an average time to save for a deposit on an entry-level apartment now eight years, up from five years in 2007. Despite initiatives announced by the state government, such as accelerating land release to try and increase housing supply, and despite the record supply of 38,759 dwellings in 2017, Sydney's median house price rose 15 per cent in the last year to $1.17 million. With strong immigration levels and with property seen as a secure investment, increasing supply is the best way to tackle high house prices. To reach the long-term targets set by the Greater Sydney Commission, and with a backlog of up to 100,000 potential purchases in Sydney, there needs to be 41,250 new houses built every year for the next 20 years, according to the Urban Development Institute of Australia. This has never been done before. Those in regional areas do not escape the pricing pressure as the cost reverberates out from Sydney and the other capital cities to increase house prices nationwide. According to the Demographia report in 2017, the Illawarra is the third most expensive region in which to buy a house. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's therefore imperative that we minimise the discouraging effect of housing market taxation and regulation on consumers and suppliers. Yet taxation currently accounts for up to one-third of the price of a new home. This is staggering, making a new home one of the most highly taxed commodities in Australia. For example, a new home in New South Wales costing $800,000 would attract the following fees: GST of $80,000; state stamp duty of $31,768; a state biodiversity contribution of $30,000; and a special infrastructure contribution of $7,236. This sums to $179,004 in total taxation. The taxation on an existing home costing $800,000 is $31,768 worth of stamp duty. The difference in tax between a new home and an existing home is a staggering $147,236, and this is without accounting for other costs that might apply, such as land tax or local government rates paid whilst developing the site.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of all that comes schedule 5 of this bill, which is an attempt to eliminate phoenixing in the building industry. Under current law, consumers seeking a new home obtain the price from a developer before approaching their bank to secure a loan. The money is paid to the developer or builder, and the builder or developer is responsible for passing on the GST to the ATO. This occurs every three months, like for every other business under the BAS system. Phoenixing is the practice of a small minority of builders to liquidate their companies in the final three months of the building contract. In doing so, they pocket the last three months of GST before resurrecting themselves as another company. This means that tax money is ultimately not paid to the tax office.</span>

                    </a>  And wages, as Senator Cameron advises. This bill takes the responsibility for paying the GST away from the builder and developer and puts it on to the consumer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with this extraordinary departure from the fundamentals of the GST is that the industry is simply not set up to deal with money in this way. Industry representatives have told me that, although they support tackling unscrupulous developers who practice phoenixing, the proposals need further scrutiny and planning. The proposed scheme requires the purchaser to provide one-eleventh of the cost of the new home to the ATO and to obtain a receipt from the ATO prior to or on the day of the settlement of the property. It is unlikely that a bank would fund the GST payment prior to the purchaser having secure title over the property, as it would mean the loan would be initially unsecured. The minister has said that the GST payment can be made on the day of settlement, but at the very least this will require considerable alterations to current practices by purchasers and lenders. Development industry representatives have told me that the only system currently available to process the GST payments by purchasers is for a cheque to be issued and photographed as proof that it has been paid before or on the day of settlement. The PEXA system, an e-conveyancing tool, is available and preferable for dealing with this transfer, but time is needed for the industry to move across to this system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also assured that this bill will not be retrospective and that agreements made before the proposed implementation of 1 July 2018 will operate under the existing system. That's something at least. Schedule 5 operates under the assumption that shifting the GST to the consumer automatically means it is shifted to an individual who is much easier for the ATO to trace, but consumers are not always individuals. Companies also buy new houses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, the proposed bill has been rushed and will lead to unintended consequences that will put a greater burden on consumers and developers. This bill is an extraordinary overreaction to the rare event that is phoenixing. It uses a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The government seems to want to chase down every tax dollar regardless of the consequences. It is acting as if no tax dollar should be left behind. At the very least, schedule 5 should be delayed until mid-2019 to allow the various parties to adjust their systems. Otherwise, there is a considerable risk that much-needed new housing will not be built and consumers will continue to be priced out of buying a new home.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Measures No. 1) Bill 2018. In particular, this bill makes a number of changes to the superannuation system which Labor support. The one aspect of the bill that I wanted to make a few short comments on concerns the changes to try to rein in a degree of phoenixing. We have heard from other speakers in this debate already about the problem that phoenixing is causing in Australia. In short, phoenixing basically involves company directors operating, running up big debts, not paying those debts and then collapsing their companies without having paid the debts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But before they collapse the company, they transfer the assets across to a new company and go on living happily ever after while leaving a trail of destruction behind in the form of creditors that they haven't paid. The reason I'm speaking on this is that this is a particularly big problem that we're experiencing on the Gold Coast, where I have my office. It's an issue that I've been taking up both with the regulatory authorities and in the local media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill addresses one aspect of phoenixing that directly concerns the government. Good on the government for making some changes which protect its own revenue from the actions of phoenix companies. Specifically, the proposed changes included in this bill will require purchasers of new homes or land to remit the GST component of their purchase price directly to the tax office rather than pay that GST to, for instance, a developer who would then remit that GST as part of their next business activity statement. The problem that the government has been experiencing—and the ATO in particular—is that too many developers have been taking that GST payment from buyers and then collapsing their company without having remitted the money to the tax office. They then close down their company, go into liquidation and owe the tax office debts which never get paid. I think it's a good thing that the government is cracking down on this and am very happy to support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see the government take similar steps to protect a range of other people who are suffering from the actions of phoenix companies. As I said, this has been a particularly big problem on the Gold Coast. Even over the last 12 months, there've been a series of construction companies that have gone into liquidation, owing subcontractors, homebuyers, suppliers and a range of other people significant amounts of money that these people never get to see because the companies go into liquidation. They transfer all their assets to other companies so they can't be used to repay their debts. They go on, live a great life and, in many cases, the subbies and homebuyers go broke. I've met people involved in the Gold Coast construction industry whose marriages have fallen apart as a result of debts that they've been owed by phoenix companies. They are rightly cranky that not enough is being done to protect their interests. What I say to the government is, 'Great—good on you for protecting your own revenue from people who are doing the wrong thing, but how about we take some action to protect other people who are also losing out from subbies?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cameron went through in some detail some of the proposals that Labor has had on the table for a long while now. In particular, we want to see company directors have director ID numbers to make it easier for regulatory authorities to track directors of phoenix companies. At the moment, it's harder to get a dog licence or a drivers licence than it is to become a company director in Australia. That isn't right when you think about the amount of money that companies are playing with. In many cases, it's other peoples' money. We think that the introduction of a director ID number would go a long way to helping ASIC and other regulatory authorities keep tabs on the people who are doing the wrong thing. We also want to see tougher penalties introduced for phoenixing. We think at the moment the penalties are too low and don't send a message to the people who are doing the wrong thing. We also want to see ASIC start taking some greater action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago, I again met with a number of subcontractors on the Gold Coast and their representative group, the Subcontractors Alliance. They have completely lost faith in ASIC taking action against the rogues in the industry, whether we're going back a few years to Walton Construction—one of the big construction companies with a large presence in Queensland that went broke, owing tens of millions of dollars to subbies and suppliers—or more recently with other groups like Future Urban Residential on the Gold Coast and former Senator Bob Day's company, which went broke and owed lots of people money as well. These subbies feel like they have repeatedly taken their concerns up with ASIC but are not seeing any action taken. It's for that reason that, only this week, I've referred their concerns to the Federal Police because, quite rightly, these subbies say to me: 'This is just fraud. Let's forget about breaching corporations laws. This is straight-out fraud by company directors. It should be treated as such and it should be investigated by the police.' So I've referred these matters to the Federal Police in the hope that some greater action can be taken to protect the interests of subbies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, we support the bill. We support, in particular, the move to tighten the net around phoenix companies when it comes to the government receiving its tax revenue. I look forward to also supporting government legislation in the near future that will take some action to protect the other people who suffer from phoenix companies, such as subbies.</span>

There have been some considered contributions to it and I thank the senators who have indicated support for the government's position. This bill includes schedules that will extend tax relief for merging superannuation funds, provide ongoing funding to the Gateway Network Governance Body and transfer the early release of superannuation function to the ATO. In addition to those schedules, schedule 5 addresses phoenixing activity in the construction sector. It protects GST revenue and stops tax evasion by property developers by requiring purchasers of new residential premises or new residential subdivisions to remit the GST to the ATO. Senator Leyonhjelm has concerns about the obligation of the purchaser to remit the GST to the ATO. I note that the legislation allows for purchasers, through their solicitor or conveyancer, to hand over a bank cheque made out to the ATO for 1/11th of the purchase price on or before settlement. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about Labor's commitment to the federal electorate of Flynn. It's one of my duty electorates and a region for which I have a great passion. I was fortunate to be able to host a town hall meeting in Gladstone last week, on 20 March, with the federal Labor leader, Mr Shorten, and newly preselected candidate for Flynn, Zac Beers. The Gladstone Entertainment Convention Centre was packed with families, individuals, local workers and small-business owners. There were great questions on a broad range of topics and there was constructive political discussion. There was a lot of support for Zac's candidacy. He's a great candidate. I am a great champion of Zac. I was proud to support him in the lead up to the 2016 election, and I will be working hard to support him in the next election, whenever that is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of those listening to this broadcast, I want to talk a little bit about Zac. He's a Central Queenslander through and through. Growing up in Gladstone, Zac was the school captain at Tannum Sands State High School. After graduating school, Zac went on to work as a painter and a scaffolder at the local alumina refinery. Following a stint working for Chris Trevor, the now deputy mayor of Gladstone, Zac went on to work as an organiser for the Australian Workers' Union, following his passion for standing up for workers rights. Zac loves his footy; he is a life member of the Tannum Sands Seagulls, where he likes to have a run.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Zac will always stand up and fight for Central Queensland. He will fight for jobs for locals, better pay and more job security. He's helped to launch federal Labor's campaign to crack down on dodgy labour hire arrangements—an issue which is also particularly close to my heart. I note there was an article in the Gladstone<span style="font-style:italic;"> Observer</span> where Mr Shorten stood alongside Zac and identified that there are a number of labour hire companies undercutting workers wages and offering little job security. We know that labour hire strips workers of all their rights and protections. Workers who are employed through dodgy labour hire arrangements find themselves in a position where they can't speak up about anything at work because the minute they do they risk losing their job. These are the things that Zac is passionate about, and he will fight on these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Zac also helped Mr Shorten and shadow health minister, Ms Catherine King, launch federal Labor's Fix Our Hospitals campaign in Gladstone on 21 March. It is concerning to me that we have a situation where there are cuts to our hospitals. In Gladstone, Mr Shorten said the federal government's funding of 45 per cent of state hospital budgets until 2020 amounted to $6.1 million less reaching Central Queensland hospitals than what would have been provided under the last agreement reached with the states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of any voters from the electorate of Flynn tuning in or reading this speech, I want to go through some of the choices you have at the next federal election. If Nationals member Mr O'Dowd is re-elected, we're going to get the same old coalition in-fighting, the same old talking the talk about infrastructure but still no action on the Port Access Road, $6.1 million less funding for Central Queensland hospitals and $17.1 billion less funding for Australian schools. Examples of local schools cut over the next two years include $1.35 million less for Gladstone State High School, $870,000 less for Toolooa State High School, $300,000 less for Gladstone Central State School, $220,000 less for Gladstone South State School and $570,000 less for Gladstone West State School. By contrast, if Zac Beers and Labor are elected, Flynn residents will have a united government and shared values between state and federal governments, leading to better outcomes for regional Queenslanders; $17.1 billion back into the education budget; an end to the fight on healthcare funding; $100 million for the stage 2 of the Gladstone Port Access Road, which will create around 200 jobs; and a plan for real jobs in regional Queensland, investing in infrastructure, manufacturing, mining, agriculture and energy. Zac Beers understands industry. He understands the need for jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be up in Gladstone again next week with Zac. We will be hosting the shadow minister for communication, Ms Michelle Rowland, for a forum on the National Broadband Network. No doubt, local residents in Gladstone have concerns about the length of time the rollout has taken to come to Gladstone, but this means there's still time for the government to see sense and implement fibre-to-the-premises or at least fibre-to-the-curb across the region. Labor is committed to regional Queensland. We can prove it: we're on the ground listening and developing policies for regional Queenslanders. The contrast is clear.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  I rise tonight to make a brief contribution about the importance of the north, particularly the importance of the north of my home state of Western Australia. It's great that the minister is in the chamber at this time. The north of Australia has a population of only 1.3 million but contributes over 10 per cent of our national GDP. Obviously, it's a very important part of Australia and it's a very important part of Western Australia, particularly with the contribution of iron ore leaving from the Port of Port Hedland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has a very strong commitment to developing the north. It commissioned the first ever white paper on developing northern Australia. It is a very important initiative to make sure that we continue this push to further develop that part of Australia—which is significantly underdeveloped—in a sensitive way but in a way that delivers jobs and growth to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak about a couple of things very quickly. The Ord River scheme is a significant project that has been underway for a very, very long time in Western Australia. It's in the East Kimberley, a part of the world that gets enormous rainfall. Lake Argyle holds 20 times the volume of Sydney Harbour—11 million cubic metres of fresh water. The first stage of the project involved 14,000 hectares of irrigated agricultural land, stage 2 added a further 13,400 hectares of land, and there is a proposed stage 3, which is largely in the Northern Territory. This represents, potentially, a significant food bowl, for Australia and also for export to the rest of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to export, particularly in order to export perishable high-value crops, we need air links out of the north. We need also need air links out of the north to support tourism. That's why it is exciting that SilkAir, the regional offshoot of Singapore Airlines, will be trialling direct flights to Broome over the next few years. That will bolster tourism and facilitate the trade of high-quality agricultural goods from the north of Western Australia into those key markets of Asia—particularly the Singaporean market, which is obviously a very important one for my home state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On tourism numbers, recently released tourism numbers show that, whilst there was no decline in numbers coming into Western Australia, people were staying for a slightly shorter period of time and, commensurately, spending a little less money. Obviously that is a trend we do not want to see continued. We need to see tourism as part of that mix, but we also need to see the export of those high-value agricultural goods out of the north—goods that are being produced and can be produced in greater volumes, as part of the ongoing expansion of the Ord River project, in conjunction with our existing major exports, the live cattle trade and mineral exports out of the north. All these things combine to create a very vibrant, exciting part of Australia and of our economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  Last Friday, I met with the CPSU representatives in my Hobart office regarding the Turnbull government's plan to tender Australia's visa processing services, at the potential cost of thousands of jobs Australia wide and the integrity of our national security. This proposal threatens over 100 jobs in my home state of Tasmania—the jobs of people who deal with complex visa processing issues. The Turnbull government has begun a process to privatise the delivery design of Australia's visa services over the next five years, releasing a paper requesting 'expressions of interest for market providers'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the Department of Home Affairs recently outsourced 250 departmental call centre jobs to the New Zealand company Datacom, while the Department of Human Services outsourced 250 Centrelink jobs to Serco. The Turnbull government's privatisation obsession fails to value the expertise and experience of Australia's public servants, both in Tasmania and around the nation. Visa processing services are too important to the security and fabric of Australian society to be handed over to private companies. I am extremely concerned by the loss of jobs and the potential impact on national security. We all know that when public services are privatised, Australian taxpayers end up paying more and getting poorer services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been personally written to by a number of officers from the Department of Home Affairs in Tasmania who have grave concerns for their future employment and the integrity of Australia's visa processing regime. They are concerned with not just the loss of their own jobs but the integrity of our visa processing system. Their words convey the true impact of such privatisation. One said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Losing these jobs will mean many families or individuals may have to leave Tasmania in search of work or place a burden on our welfare system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The privatisation of this work undermines data integrity and will result in poorer service quality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another officer said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Private companies and contractors cannot be trusted with the sensitive data required to do this job. Minister Dutton recently refused to rule out handing this data over to a foreign country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A private company will inevitably end up providing a poorer service and at a higher cost to the government and to the taxpayers of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, another said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My job is important to me. I proudly undertake my duties and serve the Australian community with integrity, diligence, courtesy, honesty and most importantly a sense of great responsibility. These traits are shared by the vast majority of my colleagues. I certainly have concerns regarding how private enterprise will instil these essential characteristics into their workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tasmanian Liberal representatives' approach on this issue has been incredibly disappointing. In response to public servants' letters of concern, Senator Abetz responded:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm sure you perform your duties in a diligent and professional manner … However, no Government should make decisions on what is best for the country based only on how the decision impacts the employment of a particular group of public servants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when so many national security concerns and different pieces of legislation are being put forward by this government, Senator Abetz fails to see concern in the loss of over 100 jobs in his home state, in Hobart, or the broader national security issues. This is a most short-sighted attempt to outsource the jobs of a group of public servants to the private sector, with no real guarantees in sight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Abetz's approach has been mirrored by the government's plans. The Turnbull government's obsession with privatisation fails to treat Australia's public servants with the respect that they deserve; instead it favours outsourcing to multinationals. Our visa processing staff in Hobart are dedicated, highly trained and hardworking, and they are the best possible people to deliver Australia's visa system and processes. This obsession of the Turnbull government with the privatisation of important government services must stop.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  I'd like to take the opportunity to speak briefly on integrity issues relating to both workplace relations and the financial services sector. At the outset, I'd like to provide the Senate with some background on NXT's thinking on the somewhat inelegantly named Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was about two weeks ago that I met up with Minister Laundy in a quiet corner of an airport lounge. He walked into the meeting room, said, 'G'day,' introduced his advisers and got straight down to business. He was, I have to say, very focused. He spelt out his case as to why NXT should support the ensuring integrity bill. As senators would know, the bill has two primary purposes: the first is to introduce a disqualification regime and deregistration regime for union officials and unions, respectively; the second is a requirement for the unions to pass a public interest test in the event they want to amalgamate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister provided me with a lengthy list of adverse judicial comments from the Federal Circuit Court and Federal Court judges about the CFMEU and its officials—after yesterday, maybe I should say 'the former CFMEU'. The rap sheet is certainly disturbing. Judicial officers are normally reserved and careful in their commentary, but the comments were certainly shocking. Justice Jessup, of the Federal Court, labelled the CFMEU as 'notorious' and 'an embarrassment to the trade union movement'. Justice Vasta, of the Federal Circuit Court, has described the CFMEU as 'the most recidivist corporate offender in Australian history'. He further observed: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It seems that the CFMEU feel that they can usurp parliament and that they can set the law in this country. There is no place for such an attitude in Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After discussing these issues with my colleagues, we decided to give in-principle support to the bill, subject to making sure that its provisions imposed, to the extent that it was possible, the same obligations on union officials and unions as the Corporations Law imposes upon company directors and companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we share the government's concern with industrial lawlessness, we are also concerned that considerations of justice, due process and proportionately should not be pushed aside in a campaign against a particular union, no matter how egregious the behaviour of its officials. This, I thought, would involve negotiating and watering down some of the provisions of the bill. But, as my advisers began work on possible measures to ensure parity between the treatment of lawless union officials and those guilty of misconduct in the corporate sector, stories from the banking royal commission started to roll in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm disturbed with the conduct of CFMEU officials, the emerging evidence before the banking royal commission has fuelled NXT's longstanding and strong concerns about ethics and integrity within the banking and financial services sector. Maybe many of the provisions that I thought harsh or overreach in the ensuring integrity bill in comparison to the Corporations Act are indeed appropriate in both legislative frameworks. I'm starting to think much of what I thought might need to be removed from the ensuring integrity bill might need to remain, provided that we see equivalent amendments to the Corporations Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government would like to bring the hammer down on lawless union officials. But, if they are to be consistent, the hammer must come down on those responsible for the financial misconduct—if not outright fraud—that has ruined the finances and lives of so many Australians, including those engaged in small and family businesses. The banking royal commission stories have also reinforced my view on the absolute need to make sure whistleblowing in the banking world is highly protected and, indeed, encouraged through an appropriate bounty scheme. Without prejudice to Commissioner Hayne's eventual report, misconduct in the banking sector needs urgent attention. And action from government should not be entirely put on hold until the royal commission has wound up and finished its final report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, by way of general observation, both the government and the opposition all too often wear ideological and partisan blinkers. The Labor Party has turned a blind eye to the lawlessness of too many union officials, many of them influential within Labor's own ranks. At the same time, the Liberal Party established the royal commission only with the greatest reluctance and appears much more interested in conducting an anti-union jihad than dealing with misconduct and misrepresentation in the banking and financial services sector. I hope that one day both sides will adopt a more balanced approach. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the scenes that we saw coming out of the United States and across the world over the weekend—particularly in Washington DC, where nearly a million people gathered together, led by young people, to demand that their government take action to address the scourge and terror of gun violence. I am sure that I am not the only one who was brought to tears by the speeches of Emma Gonzalez and Naomi Wadler, who spoke so eloquently for their nation, their generation and their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just the latest examples of a growing global youth movement, of young people coming together and saying: 'Enough is enough. From housing to climate change to employment and education, we demand that our government safeguard our future and listen when we speak.' Here in Australia we saw firsthand the energy and commitment within this movement during the marriage equality debate, where young people led the charge to ensure that Australia voted for fairness, equality and justice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These movements, led and driven by dedicated, dynamic and proudly passionate young people, put to shame all those who still lazily parrot the view that this generation does not care about the world in which we live or decisions made in places such as this. We, who will live in the world that is created day by day in dry, dull and deeply unrepresentative chambers such as this, are no longer willing to stand by while democracy is being hijacked by big business and they are content to rob us of our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, the young people of Australia, in solidarity with our generation across the globe, will be silent no longer. We demand to be heard. We demand the realisation of those rights which are ours, not by the virtue of some obscure piece of legislation but by our very existence as human beings: to meaningful work, to a home, to an education, to a voice in our parliament and to a safe planet on which to live. While this chamber so often recoils from the challenges of our time in favour of the comforting embrace of corporate backers, the young people of Australia are unafraid to confront the reality that politics is broken and to push back when the broken politics attempts to break us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The green movement is founded on the belief that when people come together change is possible. As a Green and as a young person I come before the chamber tonight in profound solidarity with and admiration of this rising global youth movement and pledge myself to its service. As long as there are Greens within this place and for as long as I'm given the honour to count myself among them, the young people of this nation will always have an advocate in this place—because we matter, our issues matter, our futures matter and our voices must be heard. I thank the chamber for its time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="CPR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  A number of people from Bahrain have come to see me in Sydney to speak about their deep concerns about what has been happening in their country for a number of years. In February 2011 pro-democracy protests began in Bahrain. They called for constitutional and political change. They wanted a more democratic electoral system. They wanted corruption to stop. They spoke to me of their concern about the discrimination against the Shiites, who represent about 60 per cent of the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of pro-democracy protesters has often been misrepresented. That's not surprising when you look at the actions of the government of Bahrain. It has been linked with various violent responses to democratic protests and human rights abuses. Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First, Amnesty International and Freedom House have found that the work of pro-democracy protesters has been misrepresented a number of times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is particularly disturbing to read a report from the Physicians for Human Rights that Bahrain's security forces have targeted health professionals by actually abducting health workers, abusing patients and making it very hard for these people to undertake their work. The Bahrain government has also expelled many journalists. When you look at the media coming out of Bahrain, it's very hard to find objective reports. Sadly, some of the reports coming from the Bahrain media actually run stories that it's legitimate to attack pro-democracy protesters. International journalists barely cover this part of the world at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had the opportunity to meet some of the former MPs in that country. Mr Matar and his al-Wefaq colleagues resigned from parliament in early 2011 to protest the regime's persistent crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy protests. Mr Matar was actually imprisoned and tortured. Again, the stories are deeply disturbing, and my concern is added to by how little we read in this country about what these people are facing. They have faced down tanks and they have faced down armed soldiers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, there is a real whitewashing happening of what's going on in Bahrain. Interestingly, a lot of it is being done through elite sport. There's the Bahrain Merida team. They were in the Tour de France. Many of us enjoy watching the Tour de France late at night. The Bahrain Merida team has established itself on the world circuit. It's now come a credible sixth place. But there is a real concern about the cycling team, along with the Formula 1 Grand Prix, which is a fixture in Bahrain, the Royal Windsor Horse Show and the International Triathlon Union. It is wonderful that these sporting events are occurring in that country, although they are elite sporting events and wouldn't be accessible to most people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly don't want to be criticising the sports themselves, but there are increasing reports that it is about image laundering—and FIFA has been caught up in it. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> newspaper have taken this up. They've sought responses from these various sporting bodies on how they've taken up the issue of human rights abuses considering, often, the people from Bahrain associated with these elite sporting events are under a cloud with regard to their own actions in Bahrain. Some of the statements from these elite bodies are really quite weak. Some of them have not responded at all, like the Royal Windsor Horse Show. You'd think they would surely come forward with a clear response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sheikh Nassar, who is the son of the ruling king, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, is very prominent in many of these sports. The Australian government really does need to be asking questions here, working with the people of Bahrain, because the situation at the moment is deteriorating. The fact that they are using sports to try to sanitise the situation in their country should alert us that we need to stand up for human rights in Bahrain.</span>
