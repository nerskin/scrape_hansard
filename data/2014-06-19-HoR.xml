The amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2013-14 was circulated earlier this week to insert a schedule that was omitted unfortunately during the printing process. The error arose in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel's printing process for Appropriation Bill (No. 6) that resulted in the omission of a schedule.

The motion to correct the error and insert the missing schedule we moved here in the House. I understand the opposition intends not to oppose this motion and I thank them for their support.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government remains staunchly committed to improving protections for members of registered organisations by implementing the comprehensive plan to enhance the governance and accountability of registered organisations. To be very clear, this bill enacts a coalition policy that was first released in April 2012—more than two years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we are reintroducing the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill that was voted down by the Labor Party and the Greens in the Senate a month ago. By voting against the legislation, they have demonstrated a refusal to support greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations. They have voted against improved protection for union members and have thereby given the green light to more exploitation of honest union members by dishonest union officials. They have also voted against a clearer and simpler reporting framework that would assist both unions and employer associations to comply with the framework. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absolute need for this legislation almost goes without saying—the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs have been in the media on an almost daily basis and the wider community is strongly in favour of these reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until this parliament acts, Australia will not have a sufficiently robust system to ensure that the sort of corruption that was revealed during the numerous scandals can be uncovered and eradicated before it becomes systemic as it did in the infamous HSU case. It is simply no longer tenable to argue that the present system is adequate to deal with or discourage this kind of behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions and employer associations play a critical role in the workplace relations system and the economy more broadly, and their members invest a great deal of trust in them. The community expectation is that these registered organisations will operate to the highest of standards. These organisations are given special legislated rights. With rights come responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believes that the majority of registered organisations do the right thing and in many cases maintain higher standards than those that are currently required. However, the investigations into the Health Services Union and the allegations that are coming to light through the royal commission illustrate that, unfortunately, financial impropriety can and does occur under the current governance regime and indeed that there is a rotten underbelly in some of these organisations. Let's be absolutely clear—loopholes have been identified and they need to be closed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill will provide the certainty and high standards of operation that members of registered organisations and the broader community rightfully expect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a suite of legislative measures designed to see governance of registered organisations lifted to a consistently high standard across the board. A more robust compliance regime will deter wrongdoing and promote first-class governance of registered organisations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of unions and the community not only want a strong regulatory regime but also want swift action taken when standards are breached. In order to do this, it is necessary to have a robust regulator with appropriate powers and resources, together with meaningful sanctions that can be applied when wrongdoing is revealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To improve oversight of registered organisations, the bill will establish the Registered Organisations Commission, a dedicated independent watchdog with enhanced investigation and information-gathering powers to monitor and regulate registered organisations. The new commission will have the necessary independence and the powers that it needs to regulate registered organisations effectively, efficiently and transparently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission will have stronger investigation and information-gathering powers than those that currently apply. These will be modelled on those available to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The commission will have the power to commence legal proceedings and refer possible criminal offences to the Director of Public Prosecutions or law enforcement agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission will also educate, assist and advise registered organisations and their members in relation to the new obligations and ensure members are aware of their rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission will be established within the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. While located within this office, the commissioner will have independence in the exercise of the relevant functions and powers under the law, and the authority to direct staff in relation to the performance of those functions. A special financial account will also be established for the commission to ensure financial independence, and the commissioner will have responsibility for day-to-day management of the account. The special account cannot be used, as has been suggested by some parties, to raise revenue through collection of moneys related to penalties applied to registered organisations and their officers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission will be required to report to the Minister for Employment annually on its activities, and that report will be tabled in the parliament. The commissioner will appear at Senate estimates. The activities of the commission will also be subject to the same oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman as Commonwealth agencies. This will ensure the appropriate level of transparency and public accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for information sharing between the Fair Work Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission to the extent that is required for both organisations to do their job effectively and efficiently. This is required as several administrative tasks relating to registered organisations will continue to be the responsibility of the General Manager of the Fair Work Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transitional arrangements have been included in the bill to ensure any ongoing matters being dealt with by the Fair Work Commission relating to registered organisations can be transferred to the Registered Organisations Commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also strengthen existing financial transparency obligations for registered organisations and officers. It is entirely appropriate to expect a high standard of financial reporting from our registered organisations, given the trust members place in their unions and employer associations to operate honestly and to use the funds derived from their membership fees to represent their interests rather than for any ulterior purposes. Registered organisations have substantial economic, legal and political influence. It is clearly inconsistent with community expectations for such organisations to operate to lower standards than those that apply to corporations or other comparable bodies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Thomson, Mr Williamson and the unfolding allegations arising out of the royal commission have shown us that the existing regulation does not sufficiently protect members' interests. Unfortunately, there will always be less scrupulous individuals who will seek to take advantage of their positions when standards of accountability and the risk of getting caught are too low. In the face of this kind of behaviour, a strong message needs to be sent to discourage wrongdoing by officers and to rebuild the confidence of members and the community. These measures, however, will have little impact if the penalties for wrongdoing are not high enough to act as a deterrent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, registered organisations and officers do not face the same consequences as companies and directors for wrongdoing. That is why the government is introducing higher civil penalties and a range of criminal penalties for organisations and officials who are found by courts of law to have done the wrong thing. These penalties are consistent with those faced by companies and directors who break the law. In relation to civil penalty breaches, the maximum penalty for serious contraventions will be $204,000 for an individual or $1,020,000 for a body corporate. This will apply to serious contraventions. What will constitute a serious contravention is defined in the bill. Other breaches will face a maximum civil penalty of $17,000 for an individual or $85,000 for a body corporate. By way of comparison, the current maximum penalties for even the worst misbehaviour are only $10,200 for individuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be very clear, it is the government's expectation that the highest of penalties will be rarely handed out but it is important that the courts have the ability to hand down strong penalties should the crime deserve it. We know that the courts have had an issue with the current framework with Federal Court Judge Anthony North making quite unprecedented comments last year, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The penalties [under the current Act] are rather beneficially low…beneficial to wrongdoers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also give the Federal Court the power to disqualify an officer from holding office where a civil penalty provision has been contravened and the court is satisfied that disqualification is justified. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Criminal penalties are being introduced for serious breaches of officers' duties as well as offences in relation to the conduct of investigations under the Registered Organisations Act. The maximum penalties in these areas are $340,000 or five years imprisonment or both and again will be handed down by a court which will use its discretion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Broadly, these offences relate to officers and employees of registered organisations who fail to exercise their powers or discharge duties in good faith and for a proper purpose. They also apply where an officer uses their position to gain advantage for themselves or someone else or uses information gained while an officer or an employee to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some registered organisations have indicated concern that the new penalties will mean that they will have difficulty persuading people to take on official responsibilities. The government certainly does not agree. The only people who have anything to fear are those who do the wrong thing. Officers who are operating within the law, which is the overwhelming majority of them, will have no reason to fear taking on official responsibilities. The overwhelming number of officers who are already doing the right thing should be comforted in knowing that the unlawful behaviour will be dealt with, thus ensuring ongoing member confidence in registered organisations as a whole. There should be no difference between the penalties levied against a company director who misuses shareholders' funds and a registered organisations boss who misuses members' money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise the broad community consensus for the government's amendments, including from one of Australia's most prominent union bosses, Mr Paul Howes, the outgoing head of the Australian Workers Union, who told the ABC on 26 November 2012:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I actually believe there is a higher responsibility for us as guardians of workers' money to protect that money and to act diligently and honestly. The reality is I do not have any issue with increasing the level of requirements and penalties on trade unions for breaching basic ethics like misappropriation of funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone in this place who has regard for the best interests of members of registered organisations and the protection of their hard-earned contributions will support this bill. The refusal of the Labor Party and the Greens to support the bill as introduced in November 2013 is delaying the government's attempts to protect honest union members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believes the bill sets an appropriately high standard for the governance and regulation of registered organisations. It responds to the legitimate concerns of members of registered organisations and the community as a result of the shocking behaviour of certain Health Services Union officials and allegations arising out of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. Only those officers who do the wrong thing have anything to lose from these changes. Members of registered organisations and the community have everything to gain. I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921<span style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>It is part of a package of bills that will give effect to the government's commitment to ensure that the rate of fuel excise duty applying to all fuels, with the exception of aviation fuel, crude oil and condensate, will be biannually indexed by reference to the consumer price index.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Excise has applied to domestically produced petrol since 1929. From its introduction up until 1983, changes to the excise rate were largely made in an ad hoc manner. Indexation of excise was introduced by the Hawke Labor government in August 1983 in order to maintain the real value of excise collections and to provide more stability for business and consumers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since March 2001, the excise rate applying to petroleum products has been frozen, leaving the excise rate on petrol at its current level of 38.143c per litre.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reintroduction of fuel excise indexation will provide a predictable and growing source of revenue which will be used to assist the government to deliver road infrastructure projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills will establish the Fuel Indexation (Road Funding) Special Account. This account will ensure that the net revenue raised through the reintroduction of fuel duty indexation is spent on road infrastructure. Its balance will be reported in Budget Paper No. 4.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consequential amendments will also be made to the <span style="color:gray;">Excise Tariff Act 1921</span> in order to simplify the burden on businesses by rounding the applicable duty rate of indexed fuels from three decimal places in the cent to one decimal place. On the current rate for petrol, this would have the effect of reducing the excise and excise-equivalent customs duty rate from 38.143c per litre to 38.1c per litre. However, indexation will apply in each indexation period to the three decimal places.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2014-15 budget, the government has committed around $26 billion over the forward estimates period to fund new road projects. The indexation of fuel excise and excise-equivalent customs duty will contribute to their funding by raising approximately $2.2 billion over the same time frame. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By indexing fuel excise with the consumer price index, the cost of petrol and diesel will increase by approximately 0.9c per litre for consumers in 2014-15. This would mean that 50 litres of fuel per week would cost around 45c extra or around $24 extra per annum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will not increase input costs for businesses using fuel in off-road operations or operating a vehicle with a gross vehicle mass in excess of 4.5 tonnes. This is because these businesses are able to receive fuel tax credits to offset the fuel excise paid. For off-road activities, this is the full reimbursement of fuel excise while for on-road vehicles with a gross vehicle mass in excess of 4.5 tonnes this is equivalent to the excise rate minus the road user charge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is committed to budget repair and putting the nation's finances back onto a sustainable path. Indexation of fuel excise will assist the government to build the road infrastructure for a 21st century economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Repeal) Bill 2014 is to repeal the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011 (the act).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is blessed with a diverse energy mix. Along with the traditional energy sources such as coal, which has powered our economy and our society for decades, we also have rich gas reserves which supply domestic power and through our exports make Australia an energy superpower.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One billion dollars of taxpayer funds have already been committed to nearly 200 ARENA projects across a suite of renewable energy types.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry has matched this investment with a further $1.8 billion, taking the investment in Australian renewables to a total of $2.8 billion as a result of the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very significant amount of money in anyone's language and comes on top of direct and indirect support, which amounts to literally tens of billions of dollars over the life of the program, that has occurred through the renewable energy target scheme. As well as that there have been various other state and territory renewable energy schemes.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Passage of the bill will transfer management and decision making on Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) functions to the minister and the Department of Industry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is anticipate that this will deliver savings of almost $1.3 billion, as identified in the 2014-15 budget. The investments of more than $1 billion in projects will continue under this new arrangement. Contrary to what some may claim, Australia is not walking away from renewable energy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say again—$1 billion in taxpayers' funds, and another $1.8 billion in private funds has been invested in renewable energy projects under the ARENA banner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By any definition, in any industry, that is a lot of skin in the game by Australian taxpayers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Established on 1 July 2012, ARENA's objectives were to improve the competitiveness of and increase the supply of renewable energy and related technologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial assistance, largely through grants, has been provided to nearly 200 renewable energy developments, including the construction of renewable energy projects, the research and development of various technologies and the development and deployment of renewable energy, along with activities to capture and share knowledge gained through all of these projects, to advance the sector towards full commerciality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ARENA has made significant progress towards achieving its objectives.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The investments have been made to support renewable energy projects across all stages of the innovation chain—from research in the laboratory to large-scale technology demonstration projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The total value of these projects is around $2.8 billion. Some examples of projects currently being supported by ARENA include the large solar photovoltaic project by AGL at Nyngan and also at Broken Hill—the largest solar project in Australia, and a project that was granted $166 million of taxpayer funds through ARENA; the Carnegie wave energy project, which I have followed from its inception, which is offshore from Garden Island in West Australia—a project currently at demonstration phase that will receive ARENA funding totalling $13 million; the King Island Renewable Energy Integration Project, which uses a unique combination of several renewable energy technologies and has also benefitted from over $6 million of ARENA funding ; and a facility at James Cook University that received $5 million to demonstrate biocrude production from seaweed. I congratulate the member for Herbert who has shown me this project on a number of occasions. It is an interesting project that has great potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is keen to see outcomes from these and the many other projects currently funded under ARENA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take the opportunity to thank the CEO of ARENA—Ivor Frischknecht, the chair of the ARENA Board, Greg Bourne, and the three other board members: Dr Brian Spalding, Judith Smith, and Betsy Donaghey, who have been thoroughly professional in executing their duties under the ARENA Act. They have done an excellent job and the government and I are appreciative of the work they have done. Under the board's direction, ARENA has played an important role of increasing the competitiveness of technologies and the supply of renewable energy in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will be ensuring that each project is well managed, meeting its contracted milestones and contributing to the advancement of an industry that has seen considerable government and customer funded investment over recent years—for now, almost a decade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government believes in providing the policy framework where Australian businesses can grow and compete in an increasingly competitive global marketplace without relying on hand-outs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be ensuring that the $1 billion of existing investment and the knowledge shared as a result of this investment gets us closer to this goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This focus over the life of these projects will be to make sure that the investments that are already made help progress the renewable energy industry as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Delivering on these projects will allow Australia to take a pragmatic approach, focusing on our capabilities to ensure that Australia is well positioned to take up technologies that work as they become commercial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government supports renewable energy and acknowledges the important role it plays in Australia's diverse energy mix.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And this government is making the tough choices to address the incredible debt left by Labor, along with the deficit disaster, and it is doing that by returning the $1.3 billion from ARENA to the budget as a result of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But despite Labor's appalling record in managing the country's finances over their six years in government, we still want to ensure the $1 billion of government investments in the renewable energy industry provides us with projects with every chance to succeed and advance the industry.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TONY SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:38</span>):  It is my pleasure to speak on these two bills, the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the Asset Recycling Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2014 and follow a large number of colleagues who have spoken through the course of yesterday on this important initiative within the budget. This of course was announced on budget night and the relevant bills were introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Moncrieff, on 29 May. Importantly, as previous speakers have outlined, they provide for an asset recycling fund as part of the government's infrastructure package announced in the budget—some $5.9 billion at the commencement, comprising $2.4 billion of uncommitted funds from the Building Australia Fund and $3.5 billion from the Education Investment Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the parliamentary secretary outlined, this important initiative will support the recycling of infrastructure. It is an important principle. Where government owns an asset, if it is best that that be sold, be privatised, in order for the purchase of other key assets—namely, infrastructure—it makes perfect sense. We need to upgrade infrastructure, particularly throughout the states. What this fund will do is provide incentives of 15 per cent of the sale price of assets to give the states and territories an immediate benefit, as the parliamentary secretary pointed out, to recycle their capital investments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend a bit of time on a number of aspects of this. Yesterday we saw the shadow minister, the member for Grayndler, railing against a number of aspects of this approach and announcing that the opposition would be moving a series of amendments, which clearly are designed to duplicate and complicate this process. The reason for that is, certainly in the case of the shadow minister and many members opposite, in their heart of hearts they remain opposed to privatisation. To be clear, the member for Grayndler said yesterday in this House:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am neither for or against privatisation full stop, but it must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes it might be appropriate to sell a public asset—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And on he went. I am the first to concede that he did say that. Many would say that I should take him at face value. But, given the track record of the member for Grayndler, I do not. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that, while the Hawke and Keating governments have a proud record of privatisation—privatising airlines and the Commonwealth Bank in two tranches—those opposite have never acted in that tradition. The Howard government faced total opposition from those opposite in the privatisation of Telstra, and many members—and I say exhibit 1 is the member for Grayndler—had their fingers crossed behind their back, at best, during the Hawke and Keating governments. In the case of the member for Grayndler, when he says, 'I am neither for or against privatisation full stop … it needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis,' the problem is that he has never thought of a case where it might apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back to Hawke and Keating governments and actually look at the Commonwealth Bank and look at the record of the member for Grayndler himself, we see that back in 1995, just before he entered this place as a senior member of the left on the retirement of Brian Howe, he was interviewed on ABC radio and he outright opposed the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. Let me quote him:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think in spite of that, I guess there is substantial disillusionment when you can have something such as the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank without the Left making a statement in opposition to that. And I think that there's considerable disillusionment amongst the rank and file of the party, not just the Left, but I think it crosses the factions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Oh, I think that there is perhaps a view at a rank and file level that the Left does have to be a bit more vocal, that the Left does have to differentiate its political perspective from the views of the Government at a time when it's necessary, whether it be the Commonwealth Bank—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then he goes on with a number of other issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear about this: the member for Grayndler, if he had his way, would still have the Commonwealth Bank in government hands. Think of that: in 2014 the member for Grayndler would have the federal government owning a bank. I have not had the time to go back and see what he said at the time of the privatisation of government owned airlines, but I think he would have had a consistent position back then of opposing that as well. He certainly opposed the privatisation of Telstra. And that is really what is driving those opposite. If we look to the asset recycling initiative, which is designed to give an incentive to the states to sell assets and to purchase new infrastructure that will build their economies and build the national economy, you only have to look to his home state of New South Wales, where Labor governments, particularly under Morris Iemma, sought to privatise their electricity assets. That was opposed by the Left vigorously, opposed by the current leader of the opposition up there in New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what has been the end result of that long period of opposition by the Left of the Labor Party to privatisation? It has been that the asset has diminished in value, the public has lost the opportunity it would have once had to get greater value and even better infrastructure. That is the approach of the shadow minister opposite when it comes to privatisation. Yesterday he and a number of other speakers took a lot of time to lecture the government on proper processes with respect to infrastructure.</span>

                    </a>  It was a bit rich, as my colleague interjects in support. Regarding proper processes on infrastructure, all of us on this side of the House can cite the big national projects for which they had no process. The process for the commitment on the NBN was done on the back of a beer coaster on a VIP flight. But in each of our electorates, particularly in the lead-up to the last election, we saw an incredible lack of process. I am going to take the time of the House—it is fortuitous that you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, and I make no accusations against you—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TONY SMITH:</span>
                    </a>  It is good to have the member for Fraser back there at the table. He carries a lot of luggage with him these days; he has to carry his books around wherever he goes. But getting back to asset recycling and processes on infrastructure spending from those opposite: I have often said that they have an unembarrassable quality about them. When it came to local infrastructure, as we all saw in our electorates, here is a case of what those opposite consider to be proper process. In the lead-up to the last election the then minister for regional Australia, the member for Ballarat, visited the Yarra Valley, in June of last year, and announced funding for three projects: a tourist railway in the heart of the electorate of Casey to the tune of $3.5 million; an initiative in the electorate of McEwen; and a swimming pool in the electorate of Deakin. They were all announced on the one day. But guess what had happened by the time the writs were issued some months later? It transpired that the minister had signed off with great haste on the funding announcements in the electorates of McEwen and Deakin but went on strike, refused to sign off on the initiative in the electorate of Casey. It fell to us to make that pledge that we would honour what those opposite had promised but failed to deliver—and I am pleased to say that we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that story is typical of what went on in the dying days of the Gillard and Rudd government when it came to process on infrastructure funding. Those opposite are in no position to lecture anybody on proper process when it comes to infrastructure funding or, as many speakers on this side of the House have pointed out during the course of this debate, on processes for so many of the programs that they undertook, be they school halls or pink batts. The shadow minister, when he was minister, had a lot of advice, including from the Infrastructure Finance Working Group back in April 2012. At that time they made the very point about the importance of asset recycling. They had this to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Infrastructure Australia is already looking at ways to encourage the sale and recycling of government owned infrastructure to fund new projects. The Australian Government should continue to work with State and Territory governments in assessing potential assets for sale and opportunities for better use of existing assets, for example, through pricing of asset use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And on it went. It put that principle to him time and time again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course the shadow minister cannot say he is in favour of this initiative wholeheartedly, because he cannot think of an asset he would be prepared to sell. As we have seen, he was opposed to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I set this challenge for those opposite: I would like the shadow minister to come out in support of one privatisation that has occurred—just one. We know he opposed the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I am very happy to say that, if the shadow minister believes that the Australian government in 2014 should own a bank, it is very difficult to think of one privatisation in the Hawke-Keating era that he would have supported. It is very difficult to think of a single privatisation that he would support today. He comes in here and talks the talk, but his record speaks for itself. That record shows that, while those opposite like to bask in the Hawke-Keating tradition, very few of them believed in it. The shadow minister and member for Grayndler is exhibit A on that front.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr LEIGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  by leave—Last night I was speaking about the distinction between a market economy and a market society, arguing that those opposite believe in a market society in which they have a theological support for privatisation across the board. We on this side believe in a market economy. We have a pragmatic attitude to markets and privatisations, which is that we should take things on a case-by-case basis, analysing each decision on its merits and deciding whether it is in the interests of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of issues that are important in considering the Asset Recycling Initiative. One of these is an issue that was raised by Flavio Menezes in a piece for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span> in which he noted that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The key issue is that most projects in the top two highest priority lists, adding up to over $A25 billion, are either road extensions and upgrades, or urban railways or busways. While worthwhile, these projects will not be suited for a capital recycling program until a comprehensive user pays system is in place. In fact, there are only two projects in those lists that would fit well into a capital recycling program, namely the Oakajee Port (A$5.4 billion) and the Darwin East Arm Port Expansion (A$336 million). This is well short of the revenue that may be raised by asset sales and so recycling of capital would not be very effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He concluded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This means that capital recycling, while a potentially worthwhile concept in a world where governments cannot borrow directly, will be at best one additional tool for funding infrastructure. At worst, the proceeds from the sale of assets will be spent to ensure future electoral support, on projects that would not pass a cost-benefit test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a concern of this side of the House. While Labor had a strong process in place for Infrastructure Australia to ensure projects were scrutinised based on their cost-benefit ratio, those opposite seem to want to return to the days of National Party pork-barrelling, the days of Roads to Recovery, where careful analysis by journalists, including Mark Davis, and an economic paper that I did showed very clearly that there was a partisan skew to the Roads to Recovery funding. It was not funding based on the highest cost-benefit ratio; it was funding based on the highest political pay-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see this ideology replacing evidence again in the case of this government opposing investment in urban rail projects. Even though urban rail projects have a high pay-off and even though commuting times in Australia's cities are too high and one of the best ways of reducing them is through better public transport, this government has stepped back out of investment in urban rail. We on this side of the House have a proud record in urban rail. The Rudd and Gillard governments invested more in urban public transport during our six years than every other government back to Federation combined. We call on this government to put evidence ahead of ideology and to back important urban rail projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to note where the resources are coming from to provide the initial contribution for the Asset Recycling Fund. The initial contribution of $5.9 billion will be funded by $2.4 billion ripped out of the Building Australia Fund and $3.5 billion ripped out of the Education Investment Fund. The Education Investment Fund was established to provide funding for projects to create or develop significant infrastructure in higher education research and vocational education and training institutions. The abolition of the Education Investment Fund raises big questions about this government's commitment to the long-term, sustainable funding of infrastructure for the teaching and research of Australia's public universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now clear that the Asset Recycling Fund will not allow for investment in research infrastructure, which means that 59 per cent of the seed funding from this Asset Recycling Fund will come from investment that might otherwise have gone into education. As the Australian Technology Network of Universities has noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">EIF funding has been used to develop new research and education infrastructure across universities, VET institutions, research centres and institutes and the CSIRO (pertaining to the SKA). The provision of modern research capabilities comes at a cost. To date 71 infrastructure projects have been funded by EIF to the sum of $2.4 billion. This included $643m in funding for pure research infrastructure—not including funding for dual purpose teaching/research infrastructure across a wide range of fields including Medical Research, Science and Engineering since 2008.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Education Investment Fund is abolished without any replacement, our fear is that Australia's research performance will suffer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer has spoken about his desire to have more Australian universities ranked among the best universities in the world. Those are fine words but they are not matched by actions. The actions of this government are: ripping money out of research; shutting down the Education Investment Fund; not having a minister for science; ripping 1,000 jobs out of the CSIRO; and showing a general disregard for experts across the spectrum, whether they be expert bodies like CAMAC, experts from the charities commission or experts on climate change. This government appears not to have ever seen an expert body that it did not want to shut down or stymie.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a proud record on infrastructure. When we came to office in 2007 Australia was ranked 20th in the OECD for our investment in infrastructure. In our final two years in office Australia was ranked No. 1. We had been well outside contention in the OECD but got the gold medal in our final two years in office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That investment in infrastructure by Labor was carried out based on the best evidence. Our concern about this bill is that it will not be based on the best evidence. It will not be based on sound science and expert advice, and it will encourage privatisations in instances in which those privatisations are not in the best interests of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kennett government lost office in 1999 due in large part to its theological belief that privatisation was always better. The Howard government's approach that if you could find it in the <span style="font-style:italic;">White Pages</span> then government should not do it was, I think, found in many cases to have cost the taxpayer more. A theological belief in privatisation does not serve the Australian people well. A pragmatic analysis of privatisation on a case-by-case basis is what Australians deserve and the risk of the 15 per cent incentive is that they will not get that pragmatic approach from this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support education infrastructure and we are concerned about the money being taken out of that. We support transport infrastructure but we believe that there are smarter ways of investing in transport infrastructure than those in this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise and speak on the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 because this bill, and what is delivered in this bill, is part of the four pillars of commitment that the coalition gave before the last election. I would like to go through what those four pillars were.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first was to stop the boats, the second was to repeal the carbon tax, the third was to repair the budget and the fourth was to build the roads and the infrastructure of the 21st century. So let us have a quick look at how we have actually gone so far on those four pillars of commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stop the boats: I remember before the last election that we were continually told that this could not be done. It was all too hard. Well, today we have marked the milestone of six months without a single unauthorised boat arriving on Australian territory. Six months without one single boat—this has saved the taxpayer $2 billion and also we have not had one single life lost, which is more important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Minister for Immigration is at the table, and I think the whole country should congratulate him on the strong stand that he has taken. They said he could not do it, he has proven them wrong and the public—every Australian citizen today—should be thanking the Minister for Immigration for that enormous achievement of six months without one single boat arriving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second commitment was to repeal the carbon tax. Again, I remember sitting on the other side of the chamber during the last parliament and good old Mr Combet, then the Minister for Climate Change, said that it would not and could not be done. We could not repeal the carbon tax and we would not repeal the carbon tax. We know that a few days before the previous election we were told by the then Labor government that the carbon tax was terminated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we get to where we were successful in winning the election: we came into parliament and the very first order of business was legislation to repeal the carbon tax. It was passed by the House of Representatives but over in that other place called the Senate, the Labor Party, holding hands with the Greens, continue to block it. So we are hopeful that with the change of the Senate come 1 July we will see that second pillar of our commitment fulfilled to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third pillar was to repair the budget. Again, we have an opposition in complete denial that there is a crisis. They have been running around saying, 'Oh, there's no problem. The budget doesn't need to be repaired. Just let's keep on spending.' This week, John Edwards, the Reserve Bank of Australia board member, put that dangerous delusion to sleep. John Edwards was appointed by the former Labor government in 2007 to sit on the Reserve Bank board. He was actually also a former adviser to the Keating Labor government. He said, 'I have no doubt there is a budget crisis.' Remember, this is a former Labor adviser—a board member of the Reserve Bank, confirming that there is no doubt there is a budget crisis. He continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We're accumulating debt as a higher share of GDP and of course in absolute terms, (it's) absolutely astronomical …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely the time has come that this dangerous denial, that we have to deal with the budget crisis, is put to bed?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to what this bill relates to: the fourth pillar of our commitment which is to build the roads and the infrastructure of the 21st century. It is interesting to see the approach of the previous Labor government in their six years and how they have left us with such a substantial infrastructure deficit. I well remember an example of Labor's approach to infrastructure. Just before the 2010 election, we had the then Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, and the then New South Wales Labor Premier, Ms Keneally, heading out to Western Sydney and making a grand announcement of the promised Parramatta to Epping Rail Link.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that much of this has disappeared down a memory hole, but I was able to find a media release about it from the former member for Bennelong, Ms McKew. There is a picture of the former member for Bennelong and in the same photo there is the current member for Grayndler, the current shadow minister for infrastructure. He is looking very sheepish in this photo. The media release says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this bill is important. It incentivises the states to get on and get the infrastructure we need built to get our country moving and to clean up the mess we have been left in so many different areas. The bill will make $5 billion available to the states where the federal government will actually pay the states and territories an extra 15 per cent of the sale price of any assets they sell and recycle. That is the point. We want our state governments to get on with building that infrastructure. This is what incentivises them. This is exactly what the federal government should be doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Fraser. I know he would prefer to have some giant centralised department here in Canberra full of bureaucrats deciding what and where the states should spend on their infrastructure, but that is not the approach the coalition takes. It is a fundamental difference between our two sides. We in the coalition believe that decisions are best made by those working closest to the coalface. In contrast, we know the opposition believe in centralised, bureaucratic decision making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fraser also referred to experts. So many times in infrastructure planning we have seen the so-called 'experts' get it hopelessly wrong. We have seen that with the Lane Cove tunnel in Sydney, the Clem Jones tunnel in Brisbane and, of course, the cross-city rail link—even the Sydney Airport link. All the forecasts of the so-called 'experts' were hopelessly wrong time after time after time. This is why the states are in a much better position to make these decisions. They are closer on the ground than some bureaucrat here in Canberra. This is why providing that 15 per cent incentive will get them moving to build the infrastructure that this country desperately needs as quickly as possible.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to comment on a few comments made by the shadow minister for infrastructure and member for Grayndler in this debate. He said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We planned and funded the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, delivering major productivity gains to Sydney and taking 3,300 trucks off the road every day …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This statement is a complete and utter furphy. It is completely misguided. It fails to understand the complete distribution chain. It is a mistake that has already cost the Commonwealth over $100 million and will potentially cost the Commonwealth a lot more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First you must understand the concept of the distribution of goods via either an intermodal or the standard truck. When a container arrives at Sydney port, it can go on a truck. The truck then goes to the warehouse, the container is unpacked and the truck returns to a container yard to eventually go back to a port. With an intermodal concept, at the port, instead of going on the back of a truck, the container goes on a train. It then goes on a rail link through Sydney, gets unloaded from that train and then goes on a truck, and then that truck takes it to its distribution point. Unless you are unpacking those containers and pouring the goods in a big hole somewhere in the Moorebank intermodal, you are not taking a single truck off the road at all. You do not have a rail siding at every warehouse door. You still need to get the goods from the intermodal to the warehouse via truck. At the very best, you are potentially maybe reducing the travel time and distance those trucks will need to travel to get to their warehouse destination. No trucks are taken off the road.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept of the Moorebank intermodal seems to be 'build it and they will come'. The question is: which companies will actually use the Moorebank intermodal? The MooreBank Intermodal Company have actually produced a map showing import destinations. To be honest, this is potentially very misleading. If anyone looks at this map, it looks as if there is this huge market in south-western Sydney for containers—nice big orange and green colourings on the map. If you actually break it down, go in and look at where the containers currently go, which should be the first question you ask, there is simply no market around Moorebank for these containers to go to. There is one market based around Enfield, but we already have an intermodal due to open there at the end of this year, so that zone around Enfield will not be serviced by the Moorebank intermodal. We have another zone south of Sydney in the Campbelltown area, but we already have an intermodal there, so the Moorebank intermodal will not service that area. And there is currently no volume whatsoever around that Liverpool-Chipping Norton-Moorebank area. The actual target market appears to be a market 25 kilometres to the north around Eastern Creek.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the money the coalition government is investing with WestConnex and the duplication of the M5 east, this will simply make the proposal to put an intermodal at Moorebank completely redundant. If I am an importer based out of Eastern Creek, I can get my container from the port and put it on the new WestConnex connection with a couple of traffic lights and be straight there. Why on earth would I want to put my container instead on a rail, ship it all the way around on the Southern Sydney freight line, get it off at Moorebank, unload it at Moorebank, put it on the back of my truck at Moorebank and then go up through the Hume Highway, one of the worst black spots in the entire country, through 20 to 30 sets of traffic lights to get my container up there? It simply will not work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the private sector wish to go ahead and invest money in this, good luck to them. But this will be a white elephant. I know the local residents of Moorebank have great concern about the additional number of trucks forecast to come from this intermodal terminal. But I do not believe it will actually happen, because it will not be serviced. It is not a matter of, 'Build it and they will come.' They could build this intermodal at Moorebank, but companies, importers, simply will not use it when we get our roads fixed up in Sydney, which is exactly what this coalition is doing with the WestConnex project, with roads around the new Badgerys Creek airport and with the duplication of the M5 East. We will have a much more efficient road network and we will not need to have an inefficient double-handling system of sending shipping containers around Sydney via rail and then putting them on a truck and sending them to their further destination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to consider the cost of the 270 hectares of land at Moorebank. When the Moorebank Intermodal Company negotiates with private companies to finalise this deal, we cannot give this land away. It is 270 hectares of very, very valuable land. We must make sure that, if we are going to hand this land over to the private sector, the taxpayer gets full value for it. I am convinced that any intermodal terminal built at Moorebank will be a complete white elephant.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  Infrastructure investment is what allows Australians to attend world-class schools, be treated in world-class hospitals and get to their places of business on world-class roads and railways. It is crucial for our nation's productivity and our cities' liveability. It is only by investing in infrastructure that Australia can grow in a fair and prosperous way. But funds for infrastructure investment are limited, and each infrastructure investment comes with an opportunity cost. So we must ensure that decisions made about what to fund and what projects to allocate federal funding to are given the careful consideration they deserve. We must ensure that political interest does not trump the public interest in the allocation of funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous Labor government believed strongly in investment in infrastructure in the public interest. Under Labor, infrastructure investment was lifted to record levels. In this period, Australia's infrastructure spending as a proportion of GDP rose from 20th in the OECD to first. But Labor was aware that, even with this increase in funding, not all proposed projects could be funded. It knew that, in making decisions about which project to fund, it was essential to have an independent body recommending which projects received these limited funds. That is why it linked funds that allocated money for projects to independent agency recommendations. The two funds in the bills under consideration—the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund—were both linked to such assessment bodies. These assessment bodies ensured that relevant projects met the appropriate criteria before they were allocated funding. This sorted the wheat from the chaff, meaning that only projects with a robust business case were able to get through and win Commonwealth funding. It cut the pork and focused investment on productivity-driving infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the Abbott government's actions in seeking independent analysis of their funding of infrastructure projects has so far not met their pre-election rhetoric. The bills under consideration consolidate funds from the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund into a new fund, the Asset Recycling Fund. This fund, however, has no requirement for projects to be assessed before funding is allocated. There is a general requirement in the bills that projects that are funded through the Asset Recycling Fund are 'productivity enhancing'. But no independent agency is specified in the bill to determine whether this crucial criterion has been met. Indeed, when asked who would make this assessment, the Treasurer responded, 'We will, through the Treasury, and we will form an opinion on it.' So the critical arbiter of whether the Treasurer's proposed project is 'productivity enhancing' will in fact be the Treasurer—a Treasurer with National Party MPs and Liberal Party marginal seat holders whispering in his ear and next to no external accountability on ultimate decision making. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why Labor is seeking to move an amendment that requires all projects funded out of the Asset Recycling Fund to be subject to assessment by Infrastructure Australia. The independent assessment will make sure that all projects receiving Commonwealth funding will really address Australia's infrastructure needs. Labor will also seek an amendment that will require the tabling of a disallowable instrument for each privatisation and funding transaction. This will allow privatisations to receive parliamentary scrutiny and will hold the federal government accountable for the actions taken by state governments as a result of this bill. Without these amendments, there is a real risk that key state assets, such as our hospitals and our roads, could be privatised to bankroll partisan, poorly thought out pork-barrelling projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key example of such a project is Melbourne's East West Link, stages 1 and 2. East West Link is a project that has undergone virtually no independent assessment. There are no public figures for how much the road will cost to build and no figures for how high the tolls will need to be for the private companies involved in this project to recoup their investment. No detailed evaluation of the project or cost-benefit analysis has been fully published. The Acting Infrastructure Coordinator of Infrastructure Australia, John Fitzgerald, told a Senate committee that, even three weeks ago, a full business case had not been seen by Infrastructure Australia. Mr Mike Mrdak, Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, tried to claim that the business case for Infrastructure Australia had been seen and was 'reasonably complete'. But, when questioned about what details had been provided to Infrastructure Australia about East West link stage 1, Mr Mrdak admitted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">I think Victoria are now reviewing in the light of what they are doing in terms of some of the planning issues and also the procurement issues which are now underway.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is hard to believe that an infrastructure business case without a concrete planning proposal and procurement details is 'reasonably complete'. Even an unpublished assessment by the Victorian government that was leaked to the Melbourne media suggested the project will be a dud, returning, under a conventional assessment of the project's costs and benefits, just 80 cents for every dollar spent. This lack of preparation may explain why the East West Link tunnel has been so vociferously opposed by community groups in Victoria, why more than $5 million has been spent by the Linking Melbourne Authority to guard the project against protesters, and why even now the project is tied up in Supreme Court litigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stage 2 of the project, largely in my electorate in Melbourne's west, is even less progressed than stage 1. At this stage it is not even a line on a map. No land has been allocated for it, there have been no land reservations, no environmental assessments have been done, no drilling or testing of the land has been undertaken, and no community consultation about the project has occurred. We do not know where the proposed tunnel is going to go, where the entries and exits to the tunnel will be, or even where it will cross the Maribyrnong River—by the Premier's own admission. We do not know how much traffic it will displace or divert, how many residential properties will be acquired to build the road, or what areas of Melbourne west will be most significantly affected by the construction. For the benefit of the House, I would note that this is a project that is intended to run not only through industrial areas in my electorate, but also through a number of well-established and densely populated residential suburbs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Acting Infrastructure Coordinator of Infrastructure Australia, John Fitzgerald, recently admitted that, although some discussions had taken place, 'there is significantly more information that we require for it to be a full business case'. He described the material currently under consideration for stage 2 as being in the 'conceptual' stages. Yet this did not prevent the Abbott government from pledging $1.5 billion to fund stage 2 of the East West Link—$1.5 billion for a back-of-the-envelope proposal, $1.5 billion for a project that is not even listed on Infrastructure Australia's priorities list from December 2013, $1.5 billion for a project with plans so utterly lacking in detail that, according to Victorian Premier Dennis Napthine, it may 'possibly' include viaducts, it may 'possibly' include bridges and a tunnel, and it may 'possibly' include surface freeways. They have no idea. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are plans for a road that will potentially pass through the residential suburbs of Footscray and West Footscray in my electorate. Families in these areas deserve to know the impact this project would have on their homes and on their community, but the funding for this project has been guaranteed by the Abbott government without even a modicum of community consultation. Moreover, Premier Dennis Napthine has suggested that he would like to start work in late 2015, meaning that the Napthine government 'is going to get its skates on'. With such an accelerated timeframe, it is unlikely the project will get the full community consultation it requires. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first billion dollars of funding will be allocated towards the project in the next six weeks. By 30 June, $1 billion of Australian taxpayers' money will be placed in a fund for a road that will not even be ready to receive environmental approval until 2015-16. Yet it is the government's intention that stages 1 and 2 of the East West Link will receive federal funding from the Asset Recycling Fund. Indeed, the Prime Minister was 'very pleased' to announce the funding at a press conference held at the end of May. He stated, 'We are very, very confident that this is a worthwhile investment by the Commonwealth at this time.' But I would ask how on earth he would know that. Indeed, it is one of the key projects being funded by the Asset Recycling Fund, as the Abbott government has now committed $3 billion to the project. Of course, when the Abbott government talks about a $3 billion commitment, this money does not magically appear from unused budget funds. This is $3 billion ripped from previous infrastructure projects around the country, including, most disappointingly for the commuters in my electorate, the $3 billion committed by the previous Labor government to the Melbourne Metro rail project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister likes to tout himself as 'the infrastructure Prime Minister', but the reality is that he is the 'infrastructure Frankenstein', stitching his policy and funding together by stealing funds from a series of previous Labor projects. It is just another of the Abbott government's fibs to claim that anything contained in the bills under consideration is new money to be spent on infrastructure. What these bills do demonstrate, though, is that the Abbott government only believes in one sort of transport—roads. That is why all funding for urban rail investment was cancelled in this year's budget. This is despite the fact that, early in its term, the Abbott government launched a Productivity Commission inquiry into infrastructure investment. This inquiry was needed due to the failing return on investment for private roads and tunnels. Indeed, economic geography professor Brent Flyberg has found that up to 50 per cent of traffic forecasts misjudge traffic flows by more than 20 per cent. Inflated estimates lead to significant losses when actual traffic falls below predicted traffic by a significant margin. This was certainly the case with the Brisbane Airport Link, where forecasts predicted 135,000 vehicles a day would use the toll road. Once built, however, the road was used by only 45,000 vehicles a day. When projects are only receiving one-third of their expected returns, it is understandable that investors begin to get cold feet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not rocket science to conclude, then, that the best asset for road investment is the requirement for a detailed business case before the project receives Commonwealth funding. Yet this is the one step in the process that the Abbott government seems determined to erase. To add insult to injury, this is a bill that contains an investment system primarily tilted towards private investment. Under the Asset Recycling Initiative, states and territories will be eligible to receive a federally funded 15 per cent incentive payment when appropriate public assets are sold and funds reinvested into new 'productivity-enhancing capital assets'. In real terms, this means that, if a state government sells a road and uses the funds to buy another one, they will receive 15 per cent of the road's funding from the federal government. However, one unavoidable result of this structure is that there will be a significant increase in the privatisation of Australia's publicly owned infrastructure. Further, the bill could very well decrease the amount of federal government project infrastructure funding that projects will receive, as it only guarantees that 15 per cent of the cost of these projects will come from federal funding. In the past the federal government has often provided up to 50 per cent of funding for our infrastructure projects. This shortfall in funding for infrastructure will have to be made up for by the states in funding substandard, or shoddily planned, infrastructure alternatives—and where the Commonwealth government refuses to provide any funding for these projects at all, this situation will become dire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is this clearer than with Premier Napthine's new and less-than-improved version of the Melbourne Metro rail project. Once the Abbott government indicated they were not willing to fund any part of the impeccably credentialled Melbourne metropolitan rail project, the Napthine government felt they had to come up with a more affordable alternative that they could fund themselves. The alternative proposed by Premier Napthine is a city tunnel that does not go into the city, does not service the majority of Melbourne's commuters, and calls the station next to the casino by the name of 'Fisherman's Bend'. It is a compromise project that was cobbled together when the Abbott government shut its doors in Dennis Napthine's face during the last election campaign, and it is not what the commuters of Melbourne, particularly the commuters of Melbourne's west, need or want.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous Labor government had an outstanding record of investment in urban rail projects. The last Labor government committed more to urban rail infrastructure investment than all previous governments in Australia running back to Federation combined. More than $13 billion was committed to urban rail projects—substantial nation building investment. But the bills under consideration are a depressing shift in government policy from rail to roads, a shift from detailed design and construction to big projects with little detail, a shift from independent support, oversight, scrutiny and accountability to partisan whim. It is another policy from a government with a lack of ideas and a rigid adherence to roads, roads, roads—an ideological obsession with roads, roads, roads. It is a government that cannot translate a three-word policy into a comprehensive infrastructure plan for Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this Abbott government we will see metropolitan rail systems across the country become more crowded, more creaky and more inefficient. We will see the residents of Melbourne's west saddled with a project they did not ask for, that their opinions were not sought on, before the creators gleefully announce $1 billion worth of funding. We will see projects chosen by whoever has the Treasurer's ear rather than the independent infrastructure experts of Australia. The commuters of Australia did not vote for this and they do not want it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  On any objective analysis, public assets that have been built up using public funds and public toil will deliver a better return for the public if they remain in public hands. There is a very strong principled and political argument to say that, when you have electricity networks, public transport networks and road networks that have been built up for the common benefit over generations by the public, it should be the public that holds onto them and gets the benefit of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, more importantly, any sensible economic analysis also shows that the public and consumers benefit from public assets remaining in public hands. There is a very simple reason for that. If you sell something off to the private sector, they will want to make a profit out of it. When they make a profit out of it, the costs get passed on to the public and the consumer, in the form of higher prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That has been the record in Victoria—for example, with the electricity network. What has been made crystal clear in Victoria is that from the 1950s until the mid 1990s, following integration and public ownership, real electricity prices across the country actually fell. But then in Victoria, after privatisation and after the reforms to the National Electricity Market, prices increased sharply and the reliability of the network went down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of reasons for that, and I will come to that a bit later in my speech. But the point is this: if economically there is no argument for rushing to sell off public assets, then you have to wonder what the motivation behind this bill is. What this bill effectively does is create a slush fund for the next two years to bribe state governments to sell off public assets as quickly as possible. This comes in the context, of course, of the federal government axing funds to state governments. So $80 billion comes out of health and education and we rip up agreements around health and the like. State governments find themselves increasingly cash strapped. The government does not deliver on Gonski funds for schools. Then it turns around and says, 'I'll tell you what, sunshine—if you sell your assets in the next two years, we'll give you a cash payment.' That is effectively the federal government bribing state governments to sell things off as quickly as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in Victoria, as I think is the case in New South Wales, we have state premiers and treasurers who are effectively the flying monkeys of this Prime Minister, who are prepared to go out and push the privatisation and toll roads agenda as quickly as possible. They are lining up for this fund to be established, because what the Liberal governments at the state level and at the federal level know is that the losers out of this will be the consumers, who will pay higher prices, but the winners will be the Liberal Party backers. You only have to look at who this Prime Minister appointed to his Commission of Audit and the large companies that they run to see who will benefit when public assets are sold off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know, and what we have seen in Victoria over many years, is that when public assets are sold off they get sold off to the private sector, but the public—the taxpayer—bears the risk if the sale or the operation does not work out quite as planned. So you privatise the profits but you keep the losses in public hands. That is what we found in Victoria and that is what you find right across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes no economic sense. The public is going to end up paying three times. Firstly, the public will lose an asset that in many cases generates returns for the community. So you lose the asset, and you only get to sell things off once. The idea that you balance the budget by selling off the farm is economic lunacy, because once you have sold it you do not get it back. You will get a short-term sugar hit, but after that you lose the recurrent income and you lose the asset forever. I do not know of many households who would decide that the best way to balance their weekly budget is to sell the home, but that is what this government is encouraging state governments to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will lose the first time because you will lose the asset. The taxpayer will pay the second time because they will have to pay billions of dollars—money that will just go out the door to state governments. So you are paying to subsidise the state governments unnecessarily as well. You are going to lose the third time because, just as we found with electricity and just as we found with transport, it becomes more expensive. It is a massive cost-shifting exercise to make the public pay more so that the private sector gets higher profits and everyone loses out, except for big business and the financial funds that are bankrolling them. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BANDT:</span>
                    </a>  A report that everyone ought to read, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Electricity privatisation in Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> a record of failure</span>, makes crystal clear why this is the case. Once you sell off something, you hand it over to someone who wants to make a profit—and that is fair enough; that is how the private sector works—but the consequence of it is that they will make the profit out of the public. That is the first point. What the private sector then do once they have got it—and we found this, and any objective analysis demonstrates it—is that, because they do not have an interest in investing in capital and maintaining it, they do what every company would do, which is to squeeze the maximum possible profit out of its asset. This means the network gets run down, which is why in Victoria we saw a massive spike in complaints from customers about quality and reliability. We also find that the rate of return from these companies is at Australia-wide highs. The result with the electricity network has been that the owners have made post-tax real rates of return at close to 10 per cent annually since 2006. So the profit is significant and, again, it comes on the back of the consumers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing—and this is significant—is the reason prices go up when you privatise roads and you have to pay a toll every time you go on them or when you privatise your electricity network. It costs a heck of a lot more for the private sector to borrow money to fund its operations than it does for the public sector. What this report found in the case of the electricity network—and I think the figures would broadly apply to transport as well—is that we have had a cost in privatised assets of almost 10 per cent per annum interest on the corporate owner's debt on electricity assets, which compares to government borrowings of closer to three per cent. What does this mean? It means something very simple. If you wanted to build an electricity network or a public transport network at the cheapest cost, you would say that the government should borrow to fund that investment. It would not add to net debt, because you have an asset there to back it up. Most people would say, 'Yes, let's borrow to fund something as long as we are funding a useful asset that is ours.' So you have a choice: should the government borrow at three per cent to fund the asset, or should we get the private sector to borrow at 10 per cent? When this Liberal government says, 'The answer is to hand it over to the private sector,' it is no wonder that electricity bills go up. It is no wonder that the cost of getting on the roads goes up. This is because it costs the private sector more to borrow. If we could get over this obsession with debt and say, 'If you have manageable debt set off against an asset that is there for the public good, it is a sensible thing to do,' the country would be much better off. Most households know this, because people understand that, yes, they are in debt, but it is called a 'mortgage'. They are paying off the cost of their house because they will have an asset there at the end of it. As long as it is manageable, it is okay. As long as there is something there at the end of it, it is okay. The government should adopt a similar approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we have a slush fund to create a privatised toll road—supposed nirvana—across Australia. It is going to come at the expense of public transport when we need to be investing in public transport, and it is going to come off the back of the public paying more and potentially going into more debt. This government is not getting rid of debt; it is just shifting it across to the public. It is shifting it across to the students in the form of student debt. You will now find with the higher prices here that the public is going to end up paying more. We clearly have an agenda from this government for a privatised toll road network across Australia and also an agenda to support its private backers, and it is all going to come at the expense of the public. This is why we will oppose the bill, and I will move an amendment to it shortly. But Labor now has the opportunity to join with us to kill this bill stone dead. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  I second the amendment. There is no nepotism involved, but I think the finest statement I have ever heard on privatisation came from the state member for Mount Isa, in my electorate—a person called Robbie Katter. He said that when you corporatise or privatise an essential service, you provide to that corporation the right to tax you at whatever level it feels like for forever. <span style="font-style:italic;">Enron: The smartest guys in the room</span> should be compulsory reading in this place. There are four books on Enron, and I have read them all. The head of Enron told the President of the United States and the Governor of California that corporatisation would be wonderful for them—this is what he said—because they would get more schools, more police and more of every government service if they sold California's electricity industry. We now know what the outcome was. The congressional inquiry informed the people of America that Californian electricity consumers had been skinned of $74,000 million in the space of four years. Of course the president and CFO of Enron both went to jail—perhaps not because they had broken the law; probably just because of the people's rage about the lies that had been told. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exactly the same story is occurring now. I read in a North Queensland paper where one of the politicians up there said that they needed a new football stadium. I think we have a magnificent stadium now, at the Cowboys, but they need a new one up there, and they want a roof on it, and we will have to sell the port and the railways. There is a very famous book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Th</span><span style="font-style:italic;">e Bible</span>, and there is a story in there about a bloke who sold his birthright for a bowl of porridge because he happened to be a bit hungry that morning. It was not a real good deal. Those who come from Melbourne will be well aware that 200 years ago the people of Melbourne were offered some blankets and some baubles, and they gave the greater Melbourne area to some blokes who had come in from overseas. There is obviously precedent for what is going on now—blokes from overseas have come to us and said, 'Just give us all these essential services and it'll be really good for you.' I think my blackfella brothers and cousins down there in Melbourne would say, 'We got conned.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go to reality land. In the year before corporatisation, which is privatisation by another name, the cost of electricity in Queensland—and all the states are the same—was $859 a year. That is what the consumer paid in 2005. By 2013, that had risen to $2,100, and by June 2014 it had gone up to $2,395. That is 400 per cent higher than before corporatisation. Yet, the government is advocating that this is the pathway we go down. I can say with great conviction that the economy of this country has been carried by the coal industry. At stages it has comprised nearly 30 per cent of the entire income for this country. Do not let the ALP come along with their hypocrisy here—they have sold more of the assets than the LNP. Qantas is gone; the Commonwealth Bank has gone. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories! Your life depends upon the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories; now it is a money-making machine for some foreign corporation. It even extends to the very production of money. They are talking about selling the Mint, which puts a whole new meaning on the phrase 'licence to print money'. When I was young they used to say, 'He is the sort of bloke who would sell you the Sydney Harbour Bridge.' The only joke now is that it has not been sold. But don't hold your breath.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to electricity. Close to half of Australia's export earnings comes directly or indirectly from mineral processing. That depends upon the price of electricity. The aluminium industry in Australia is one of the big three; coal, aluminium and iron ore have carried the economy of Australia for nearly half a century now. Why did we get aluminium? We produced virtually no aluminium in Australia except for the hydroelectricity produced in Tasmania, which is very cheap. Queensland got a massive aluminium industry because we had a restricted resource policy, a relentless resource policy. Every country on earth has a reserved resource policy. The Americans allow no gas to be exported from the United States unless there is no-one in the United States that wants that gas. That is called a reserved resource policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, our opponents used to call us the agrarian socialists. I do not know what you would call the Country Party, the National Party now. It is part of the Liberal Party and has been for about 20 years. Under the Country Party regime we took I think two per cent of the coal mined in Queensland for free. If you mined coal in Queensland you gave a tiny two per cent to us, but that was enough to fire the Gladstone power station, which provided more than half of the state's electricity. We put out one and a half thousand million dollars for that power station, which was then half of the Queensland budget. You talk about borrowing—the biggest borrowing government in human history probably was the Queensland government. We borrowed it because we absolutely knew that when we could provide the most cost-effective, cheapest electricity in the world we would get the aluminium industry. So not only could we provide the consumers in Queensland with the cheapest electricity in the world because we had the biggest power station in the world and the economies of scale were magnificent, but it was fuelled by free coal. This is a mortal sin to the free marketeers, and don't let the ALP be hypocrites here. They have been governing most states and federally for most of the last 25 years and most of the selling-off was done by them. But these blokes on the government benches are now saying, 'What is left to sell?' They are scrounging around and they are finding a fair bit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me return to electricity. Queensland had the cheapest electricity in the world. Under the socialists and then under the LNP it is now part of the Australian grid and this graph shows that we have the second highest electricity charges in the world. Our enemies used to call us agrarian socialists. Under agrarian socialism we had the cheapest charges in the world, and now we have the second highest charges in the world. There is the graph I asked for from the Library. Before corporatisation we were still amongst the cheaper electricity countries in the world. So that is not enough for them; they want full privatisation. A 400 per cent increase over 8½ years in electricity charges is not good enough. They have to get a lot more donations from their corporate backers. The previous speaker, the leader of the Greens in this place, referred to this sort of thing. I was the third-ranking minister in the Queensland government before it fell and I am not naive or so holier than thou enough to think that political parties are run on fresh air, and you have got to reward those people. For heaven's sake, reward them with knighthoods or reward them with places on boards, but do not reward them by giving them the people's assets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intellectual underpinnings of this are from Wat Tyler and Bishop Langton, one of the greatest men in human history. He drew up a document called the Magna Carta. If you want to know about it and understand about it, go and see the Russell Crowe movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Robin Hood</span>. In that movie they said, 'You, Mr King, do not own these assets. The land, the water, the resources and assets of this nation do not belong to you, they belong to the people, and you have no right to sell them or to take them off us.' That is exactly what is taking place here. I do not notice too many outside of Mr Bandt and myself who are prepared to go out there and fight as our forebears did in the run-up to the Magna Carta. I do not notice too many Bishop Langtons around the place either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us climb back down to specific examples. Tasmania had the cheapest electricity in the world, along with Queensland, because all of their electricity came from small hydro systems which were enormously cheap. They got the aluminium industry before Queensland did. Remember this is your second or third biggest export item for 50 years in Australia. This is an item that has been carrying the nation, with cheap electricity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I talked to the Deputy President of the ALP in Tasmania, a very erudite lady whose stepfather was Chief Justice, I think, for Tasmania. I said, 'Why do you now have the highest electricity charges in Australia and Australia is amongst the highest in the world?' She said that the reason is pretty simple. When you privatised the generating corporation they required a 20 per cent capex and profit. The capex had to be serviced and a profit had to be made—so there was 20 per cent. Then, the transmission corporation had to make 20 per cent—so that is 20 per cent on 20 per cent. Then, of course, the distribution and retailing arm had to make 20 per cent—so it is 20 per cent on 20 per cent on 20 per cent. So just straight off we had nearly a 100 per cent increase in the electricity charges in Tasmania—20 per cent on 20 per cent on 20 per cent, you can figure it out for yourself. If you start with $100 per unit you end up with $173. It is almost a doubling straight off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here you have a monopoly, or a monopoly shared by two or three people, because there are really only three generators in this country—you might argue four. I have always said the problem in this place is that your mummies and daddies never had you play Monopoly. If you played Monopoly you would know that when you own two utilities you have twice as much money per unit as when you own one utility. And if you own four utilities, for the same unit you have four times as much as if you owned only one utility. If you owned all of them then you have 700 per cent.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the industry that carried Australia, the coal industry, and that was built on— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the cognate bill are yet another example of the Abbott government's spin, the Abbott government's arrogance, and the Abbott government's extreme right-wing ideology, an ideology of a government that wants to privatise everything, wash its hands of social responsibility and let big business control the economy. The Abbott government wants people to believe that by renaming projects, by reannouncing projects, or by rearranging funding the government is offering something new.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that Australia's infrastructure is lagging and that it is holding back productivity. Good infrastructure has a direct effect on national productivity and on national wellbeing. That is why Labor, on coming to office in 2007, made infrastructure spending a national priority. Governments must lead and show initiative in the provision of public infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Major infrastructure projects are, however, costly, often costing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. For that reason it is critical that projects are chosen carefully, that the right priorities are made and that projects provide good value for the funds expended. No business would spend large sums of money without a careful cost-benefit analysis of the expenditure required, and nor should governments. That is why evaluation by Infrastructure Australia needs to be tabled in parliament before a project is committed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments proposed by the member for Grayndler do just that and will ensure that each major project is properly scrutinised and that the Australian people can have confidence in the project cost and the priority given to it. They can have confidence that the project is not just another government pork-barrelling exercise. The amendments also provide for the inclusion of a disallowable instrument, so that only projects that have a proven productivity benefit—that is, those that pass the test—will be funded by this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation also proposes to pay state and territory governments an incentive of some 15 per cent—that is, to bribe them—for privatising their assets and then reinvesting the funds they receive from those assets into new infrastructure. So the multiplier effect would give the impression that this government is spending huge amounts of money on new infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There may be some cases where privatising can be justified. I share the views of the member for Grayndler, who says that each case should be treated on its own merits, case by case. I believe that is fair and reasonable. There certainly may well be examples where it is in the public interest to allow an asset to be sold. But I also see that privatisation is too often used by governments as back-door taxation. Assets are sold and governments use the money to pay off debts or to fund other government expenditure. Once in private ownership, the price of the services or the use of those assets—whether it is toll roads or something similar—increases. But it is no longer a government asset and the governments that have sold them can wash their hands of the responsibility that goes with being in government. I saw that happen in South Australia when a previous Liberal government sold off that state's electricity assets. The choice at the time for the government was very simple: it could have cut government expenditure, or borrowed additional money, or sold the assets. By selling the assets what they effectively did was increase taxes to the people of South Australia, because paying higher electricity prices, as they ultimately did, was the alternative to the government perhaps having to increase taxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a fundamental difference, and that is that the people of South Australia, as in so many other cases where public assets have been sold, are then left paying higher prices, not just for the short term—perhaps a few years, which would have been the effect of the government having borrowed some money at the time—but forever and a day. Indeed, in my view, those higher prices are an alternative to a higher tax that the government could have imposed on the day but which would have been for a limited period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot think of one major government asset sale that has resulted in lower charges or lower costs to people, nor have I heard members opposite who have come into this place supporting this legislation provide one example of where privatisation has resulted in lower costs to the Australian community. If they can do so, I would be pleased to hear the example that they provide. Conversely, there are numerous examples where assets have been privatised—right through from utilities such as water, gas and electricity through to banking, with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and other state banks—where consumers ended up paying more and continue to pay more each day. Indeed, since the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and other state banks, bank profits have skyrocketed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is equally concerning about the sale of private assets is that the first thing that inevitably happens is that a new CEO is employed and the CEO is then paid millions of dollars—and, again, there are countless examples of that. It is the consumer, the Australian people, who are paying those excessive and exorbitant salaries to those CEOs as a result of privatisation. At least if an asset is in government hands, the government can determine the level of remuneration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole issue was put so well in an opinion piece by Professor Sharon Beder, a visiting Professor at the University of Wollongong, reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald </span>on 10 January this year. I want to quote an extract of her opinion piece. I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The privatisation of essential government services is not about competition and efficiency; it is about the redistribution of wealth and control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Privatisation has become the final resort of governments that need funds but are afraid to tax the wealthy and prevent tax evasion by big businesses. Instead, government assets are sold in a scramble for cash at the expense of ongoing dividends and government control of essential services. Struggling families and small businesses suffer most from the inevitable price rises that follow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, experience in the United States, where public and private enterprises supplied electricity contemporaneously, has consistently shown that public enterprises can provide a reliable service at lower cost to ratepayers. Similarly, in Britain and France, municipal governments offer water services at cheaper rates than privately operated services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that, in the US, some communities are now looking at buying back the very assets that they have sold, because they have come to the conclusion that it was not in the public interest for them to have sold those assets. It will be interesting to see whether that trend continues throughout the US and how successful they are in doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the matter of where the Prime Minister wants to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister of Australia. It is, again, just another one of those simple slogans that he thinks is going to become a reality. If the Prime Minister wants to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister of Australia I can assure him that he is certainly not proving to be the infrastructure Prime Minister for South Australia. In this budget the Abbott government has cut South Australia's local road supplementary funding, which was worth $17.8 million last year and was worth $51 million over the last three years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is additional funding that has been provided to South Australia for over a decade in recognition that there is a flaw in the funding formula used for the distribution of this funding. South Australia has 11 per cent of the national roads and seven per cent of the population but receives just 5.5 per cent of the local roads funding. This is a flaw that has been recognised by both previous coalition governments and the previous Labor government. It has been recognised by way of supplementary funding for over a decade. This year, where the Abbott government claims to be putting more money into infrastructure than ever before and where the Prime Minister wants to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister of Australia, the Prime Minister has cut that funding to South Australia. That means that local councils—and, in particular, country councils, who rely on this funding the most—will now have to raise their own taxes even higher if they want to carry out the necessary road works that they require.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add to this, we know that the federal government has frozen the financial assistance grants to local government for the next three years. That is a $920-odd million hit to local governments around the country. Again, financial assistance grants support country councils more than any other group of councils—and, again, the country councils will be hit the hardest. For South Australia, where most of our councils are indeed country councils, the freezing of those grants is a double hit on the cut of around $18 million a year to local road supplementary funding. So they have now been hit twice by decisions of this government. It is no wonder that the cover of the latest <span style="font-style:italic;">LGA News</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>says: 'SA roads to ruin'. The article inside the magazine highlights and identifies how South Australia is indeed going to be hit so hard because of the infrastructure funding decisions of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it actually goes one step further. If we look at the total amount of funding for infrastructure in the forward projections of this government's own budget, then South Australia gets $2 billion over the forward estimates out of $50 billion. That is only four per cent—even less than what we are getting out of the local road funding. So, South Australia has again been hit by the cuts in the local road supplementary funding, by the freezing of local government financial assistance grants and then by getting a lower percentage than I believe it is entitled to in terms of the total infrastructure package that this government has committed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting, because earlier this week mayors from around Australia were here in this place, and I know that they met with South Australian members of parliament, including the Liberal members of parliament. And I know that in their discussions they raised the question of the cuts to the $18 million supplementary road funding. They are very concerned about those funds. It is interesting that we have an assistant infrastructure minister who comes from South Australia. My question to the member for Mayo, the member for Barker and the member for Hindmarsh—who I know met with the mayors from around South Australia—is, where were you when the cuts were being made to South Australia? And what are you going to do about restoring the funding that South Australia loses as a result of this budget? The reality is that once again South Australia has been dudded by the Abbott government, and South Australian federal Liberal members have gone missing when the state has depended on them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  As is always the case with the Abbott government, never take note of the names and terms they use; think of the ones they are hiding from view. Or, in stark terms, when it comes to the Abbott government, do not focus on the smoke; focus on the reality that it is about to burn you. Only the Abbott government could attempt to—in this case, with this legislation—create a virtue out of asset recycling when and hide from view the thing they do not want you to see. The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 is designed to coax—or, as some have said in this debate, bribe—state governments to sell assets to get their hands on federal funds. The government will not provide the funds on a needs basis but rather will do it only on the basis that state governments will do this to their own constituencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of being up-front and telling people that this is a pro-privatisation measure, the Abbott government has turned green and embraced the concept of recycling—which is not surprising; since they have assumed office they have been re-using Labor government infrastructure announcements and rebranding them as Abbott government ones. And now they are taking things further, but they are being consistent. Not content to break their own promises, the Abbott government is trying to get state governments to breach faith with their own constituencies and privatise assets that those state governments did not get a mandate for. They are trying to get other governments to make unpalatable decisions on behalf of the Abbott government, which is what is happening in New South Wales. In New South Wales we have a government that is now proposing to sell the poles and wires—electricity assets—that exist in that state. We previously had a premier who made numerous public comments recently against privatisation of the distribution of poles and wires in New South Wales. But a few months later we get a new Premier, a new face and a redefinition of the term 'commitment'. The new Premier, Mike Baird, is brandishing New South Wales treasury analysis suggesting that New South Wales's regulated prices are higher than in the jurisdictions where poles and wires have been privatised. Yet that does not necessarily put a spotlight on something within that analysis, and that is that a lot of investment has been made in New South Wales to bring ageing assets into the 21st century to ensure that they can deliver on electricity in the way that modern consumers are using and demanding electricity supply, and at a quality that they can use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What they should be focused on is the analysis work that is being done in some jurisdictions in Australia where privatisation has occurred. For example, last week there was an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald </span>by Sean Nicholls and Brian Robins. Brian Robins is someone who has been following energy issues for well over a decade, so he speaks with a degree of experience and expertise. He focuses on South Australia. The article says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the state's retail electricity market was deregulated after household electricity bills soared almost 24 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today, South Australians are burdened with among the highest electricity bills on earth, ranked only behind Germany and Denmark according to a 2012 report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The average annual South Australian bill is now $2335, compared with $1960 in NSW and Victoria, figures from the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) showed …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that. And here is the bad news. I think there will be some suggestions about the future of electricity pricing in New South Wales, and we have to see whether or not reality will bear out. But it is the electricity consumer who is the loser, no matter the ownership model. And I would not necessarily be racing to embrace privatisation if I were concerned about electricity pricing. I understand that the New South Wales Nationals are concerned about this, and they will rightly be concerned about this going into the election, because their constituencies are rightly concerned about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why are we seeing this in New South Wales? We are seeing it because the New South Wales government is having to foot the bill in part for supporting a project that some are worried will turn out to be a white elephant, and that is the development of Badgerys Creek airport in Western Sydney. Importantly, this New South Wales government work is being done to support yet another breach by the Prime Minister. You might recall that in January 2013 he said that he had absolutely no plans for a second airport at Badgerys Creek. It did not take him too long to commit a breach of faith with the New South Wales people and the Australian people in committing to this project soon after getting into government. I do not recall either the member for Macarthur or the member for Lindsay or any of the candidates we stood against in Western Sydney displaying pamphlets saying that they were committed to Badgerys Creek airport. If anything, they rightly shook their fists at the notion of this airport and said that they would not support it. But now we have a government saying that that is exactly what they are going to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The interesting thing is that this government, making out that they are big and strong about these things, made a decision on Badgerys Creek airport but will never mention the actual term 'Badgerys Creek airport' because it is such a contentious issue in our region. It is, in fact, as I have dubbed elsewhere, an airport that dare not speak its name. The only time that the Prime Minister has ever used the term 'Badgerys Creek airport' was when he was before <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph </span>at their Champions of the West dinner. As I have also remarked upon, talking tough in front of <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> is like driving an ice cream van through a sweaty neighbourhood. It is not the hardest job in the world, particularly when <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> has been championing it. What was interesting that night was that—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Mr Chester interjecting</span>—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HUSIC:</span>
                    </a>  You get the concept, Member for Gippsland. It looks like you have had a few ice creams, like me!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But certainly that evening, as I have remarked upon elsewhere, the Prime Minister in talking about Badgerys Creek airport said that he did not want to see burden without benefit. So even the Prime Minister recognises that this this going to be a problem. The government's idea of the benefit is to build three roads, which the member for Mayo has described as a Western Sydney economic project. If you build three roads, amazingly you have an economic project in Western Sydney even though some of the details have not even been put on the table properly. For example, some of those roads have to be built anyway for the south-west growth centre that is going to house a city the size of Canberra—300,000 people. When you look at the program itself, one of the key projects, the new east-west motorway, at a total of $1 billion does not even have an end date put to it. We have been given a rather loose commitment that it will be completed before the airport opens in 2022. This is exactly the type of problem we have with infrastructure planning in this country—we have these loosely made commitments and not much evidence to back them up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of Badgerys Creek airport, one of the things we are being told is a big seller is jobs. Yet at a meeting that the Deputy Prime Minister convened and then did not show up for, to talk about Badgerys Creek airport, we found out from departmental officials the 60,000 jobs figure being mooted by the Prime Minister and his acolytes is not even true. It is going to be only 5,000 because 5,000 jobs flow from a single runway airport such as is going to exist at Badgerys. Frankly, we are being made commitments about benefits that are not in reality going to be delivered and we are going to be the worse for it. I will come to that in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are concerns that Badgerys will become an expensive, costly waste of taxpayers' funds. People have looked at where second airports have been built in jurisdictions either here in Australia or overseas. Here, Avalon Airport is struggling to exist. It was opened with much fanfare. There was a lot of retail presence there. I am now led to believe that all it has is a food-and-coffee outlet. Qantas has reduced its presence there. Avalon has been able to assume only 1.7 per cent of air traffic from Tullamarine. So there are concerns about Avalon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look overseas to Canada, when Mirabel airport near Montreal was built it was promised that it would carry the load of the other airport that exists in Montreal that was built in the 1970s. It has turned out to be an airport no-one wants to use. It is 50 kilometres north of Montreal and was supposed to replace Dorval airport, an airport that was only 20 kilometres from the centre of Montreal. An article that Ean Higgins wrote for the Australian on 9 May said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking to other parts of the world, there is the Ciudad Real Central Airport, for example, previously known as the Don Quijote Airport, in South Madrid. Like Mirabel, it is now a ghost airport. They are airports that are not delivering, and yet we have committed billions of dollars to similar airports. It has now prompted analysts here in Australia—for example, a transport and infrastructure analyst with Deutsche Bank, Cameron McDonald—to say that the federal government's plans for Badgerys are pretty vague. Cameron McDonald said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my issue is that we have seen infrastructure that is not what Western Sydney wants; it is stuff that eastern Sydney needs to see happen. We are told we are getting it because we want it and that it is based on community research—and this is intriguing—that Labor did when we were in government. A number of MPs from Western Sydney, me included, asked then Prime Minister Gillard how you could conduct community research on a project that we did not support and it was party policy not to support. We did it anyway. Then—surprise, surprise!—the federal Abbott government got its hands on documents that were part of a cabinet process some time later. Questions have to be asked about how the Abbott government got that material and how it is relying upon it. I think that is a serious breach of cabinet process and there need to be questions asked about how the Abbott government has just felt free to use this material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To come back to the point, we are committing billions to a project that is going to suck up dollars that will not be available for other things that Western Sydney needs. Those opposite are cutting health infrastructure spending for things that we need. We cannot get those but we can have an airport. If you ask any other Western Sydney resident what their infrastructure needs are, they will not be asking for an airport because they do not believe it is in the interests of Western Sydney residents to have that airport when they have other infrastructure needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one has had a serious look at unshackling the existing investment around Sydney airport. For instance, no-one is seriously looking at Sydney Airport's flight movements that have been restricted and restricted for quite some time. No-one is seriously looking at lifting the movements per hour from 80 to 85. One of the arguments is that the roads around the airport will not allow that to occur. Well, if that is the case why do we have a federal government committing billions to roads on the other side of the city instead of looking at what would make Sydney airport work better by freeing the land-based transport around the airport to accommodate an increase in the availability of flights within Sydney? No-one has actually looked at it, yet we are going to commit billions, and the people of Western Sydney will not actually get the infrastructure that they need. They will get it on the basis of what others are claiming they need. We are just going to repeat the Canadian experience of wasting billions on an asset 50 kilometres away instead of supporting what the markets want. And this is being championed, not by people in our area but by people outside it. Again, I do not think that it is in the interests of the area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In time there may be support amongst parties for this airport, but my view is that I will take the position of sticking up for the people of our area because I think they have been dudded for long enough. We have wanted infrastructure where the city continues to grow and where it is not supported with proper infrastructure. But then no government is prepared to, in effect, retro fit suburbs that have already been built with new infrastructure. Or, if that retro fit is put forward, it is again consigning infrastructure dollars in a way that will divert from the needs of people where they actually do require better infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, I think that this government is going to make a series of mistakes that will be very costly, and the people of Western Sydney will be paying for them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ALBANESE:</span>
                    </a>  and seconded by the member for Kennedy! I indicate that the opposition will not support this amendment. It has been moved as a second reading amendment and would have the effect, because it deletes all words after 'That', of changing the title of the bill. It would have the effect of negating the further debate on this important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to indicate that there is a very good argument, which I am sure may well be pursued by the member for Melbourne and the member for Kennedy, to change the name of the bill. It could well be a consideration-in-detail amendment. They do make the point that it is perhaps more transparent a description of what this legislation is than the 'asset recycling' terminology, which is an attempt to encourage privatisation without actually saying that this legislation is about encouraging privatisation. But we will come to that point when we get to the consideration-in-detail stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have indicated that I will move substantial amendments in the consideration-in-detail stage to this legislation. This is to improve the operations of the bill and to make sure that it is transparent. The opposition's amendments will go to the issue of making sure that there is proper cost-benefit analysis so that investment in infrastructure has to be in the most productive infrastructure possible, rather than infrastructure based upon a political decision. We want the economic growth and jobs to be the key factor, not the marginality of seats—frankly, given the National Party's record on these issues and the fact that in the budget that has just been handed down there are projects like the Perth Freight Link project. The WA government have said themselves that there is no plan, there is no detail and there is no cost-benefit analysis, but it is just appeared in the budget. So, I certainly understand the motives of the member for Melbourne and the member for Kennedy for their amendment, but we will not support it at the second reading stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the proposition: we also indicate that it is our view that should any asset be privatised then that needs to stand by itself—whether that is indeed a positive thing for any state or territory jurisdiction. We do not have a view, unlike those opposite, that 'public, bad; private, good'. That appears to be the motivation of those opposite. I indicate some surprise that during this debate no government member up to this point—and their speaking list has been exhausted—not one, has mentioned the budget initiative from last year of the tax loss incentive that was put in the budget for designated infrastructure projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This came about through an exhaustive consultation process by my department with the sector. It came into effect on 11 July 2013 after legislation was carried in this parliament. This legislation was about encouraging private investment into nationally significant infrastructure. We on this side of the House recognise that government cannot do it all by itself. We need to encourage private sector investment. And we did that with very practical initiatives in legislation, ones which we know the now government paid no attention to in terms of detail over the previous term of parliament. Now that they are the government they should actually have a look at what legislation is in place that provides an opportunity to encourage investment in infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The infrastructure investment incentive uplifted the value of carry-forward losses by the 10-year government bond rate and exempted the carry-forward losses and bad debt deductions from the continuity of ownership and the same-business tests. That is, an asset that was a brownfield asset where there was no incentive for private sector investment because the loss of capital that comes in at the front end of any infrastructure project through the construction phase could not be picked up if there were a change of ownership of that asset. We introduced this practical change with a support of up to $25 billion in new private sector infrastructure investment to apply from the previous financial year. In order to receive the tax loss incentive, applications had to go through the Infrastructure Australia process, and that is the point of our amendments that I have foreshadowed. It has to be for nation-building infrastructure. That is why we build it into the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another reason as well. The money for this fund is not new money. It is money that was already in the budget in the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund. That money of $5.9 billion was there with a system around it to ensure proper expenditure. The BAF could only be used for priority projects as recognised by Infrastructure Australia. The EIF could only be used after recommendations by experts and a panel, meaning that this was making a significant contribution to the national effort in terms of science and research, producing, therefore, future productivity and future benefit for the nation. Indeed, in this year's budget—with the rhetoric of those opposite about private sector investment—cuts were made to the existing funding that had been made available in the 2013 budget for the Brisbane cross-river rail project and the Melbourne Metro project. What we had there was a system whereby there were upfront payments from the government but the government also put it forward an offer of 50 per cent of an ongoing availability payment for the capital cost. As well as that, there was an Australian government guarantee on private debt to enhance the projects' creditworthiness and help reduce the cost of capital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here you have practical examples of measures to encourage private sector investment into infrastructure. We had agreements worked out with the Queensland and Victorian governments that they walked away from because of the ideological position of those opposite who say that any Commonwealth engagement in public transport is bad. What that does is stop proper investment in productive infrastructure because, if you are about addressing urban congestion, you need strategies based upon public transport as well as roads. You need to make sure there is an integrated transport strategy in our major centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To give two other examples, we had the Moorebank intermodal project, a model in which the government established a government owned entity to establish that project to make sure it was ready to go out to market to encourage private sector investment. Without that government entity being involved in the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, it would not have happened. This is a one-off opportunity to use this large tract of defence land in South-West Sydney to create an intermodal project that will take 3,300 trucks off Sydney's roads every single day and to make a big difference in terms of rail freight. Those opposite did not seem to understand it at all. By establishing the process that we did, we covered some of the preconstruction risk that would have prevented this project going ahead. It was a win for motorists, a win for the environment, a win for our economy and a win for productivity. But what was the position of those opposite on this issue? They opposed it. They actually did ads during the 2010 election. The member for Hughes was very prominently out there opposing this practical proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in last year's budget we had the F3-M2 proposal. It was a proposal that was around and was promised by the Howard government. They just did not get around to doing anything about it. We sat down with the New South Wales government and Transurban to come up with a proposition of $405 million from each level of government. It was up to that figure—it may well be that that figure is not needed—to make sure that this long-overdue 7.7-kilometre link road would be built. It will take out the traffic lights and congestion that is currently there in that northern part of Sydney and ensure, because of the link with the M7, that people who are not going to Sydney can get around and through Sydney without going through a single set of traffic lights. It is a great example of the federal government harnessing private investment to build much-needed public infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite of course have sat down with the New South Wales government since, even though the agreement was signed and the money started to flow in the 2012-13 financial year, renamed it NorthConnex and pretended it is a new project. They had a grand press conference as part of the 'magical mystery infrastructure re-announcement tour' by the Deputy Prime Minister and his errand boy, the member for Mayo. They run around the country making re-announcements but they are not actually delivering new investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party are up for investment by government in infrastructure. We are also up for encouraging private sector investment in infrastructure. What we are critical of is this pretence that money that was already allocated in the budget is somehow new and is an additional incentive into infrastructure. So we will be proposing amendments which, firstly, ensure that the funds from this can be made available on the basis of a proper cost-benefit analysis that is transparent and published and done through the recommendation of Infrastructure Australia. If those opposite do not do that they will be taking away funds that were protected and that legislation ensured would be used for the productive side of the economy, just putting it into wherever they want it to go. Secondly, our proposed amendments will go to making it a disallowable instrument, because this parliament should get to have a say about issues if money is going to be used for those issues. Unlike the other side of the parliament, we do not just say that any privatisation is good. We want this parliament to get a say in that process, and that is why we will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage and why we will not be supporting the second reading amendment by the member for Melbourne and the member for Kennedy.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I rise to speak on the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014, which could more accurately be called the 'Taxpayer Funded Privatisation Cheer Squad Bill 2014'. This bill, along with the cognate bill, is part of the coalition's election commitment to encourage privatisation. It comes out of the philosophy of the Liberal and National parties that basically says that anything owned by the public is bad and that anything owned privately is good, as detailed by the member for Grayndler. The Asset Recycling Fund would be established by this legislation, which would be a dedicated investment vehicle providing financial assistance and incentives to the states and territories to create new productive infrastructure. I have not gone through the legislation in great detail to see how productive infrastructure would be determined or what assets would be sold. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an interesting piece of legislation in terms of looking at the philosophy of the two major political parties in Australia—the Labor Party and the coalition. I will touch on the details of the legislation and then go to some of the philosophical questions it raises. The bill contains five parts. Part 2 establishes the Asset Recycling Fund. Part 3 sets out the responsibilities of the Future Fund Board in determining how to invest the funds of the Asset Recycling Fund and in determining the nature of those investments. Parts 4 and 5 set out the reporting obligations and the delegations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The motivation for this legislation arose from the findings of a Productivity Commission inquiry which suggested that there is increasing caution amongst private investors to commit to public infrastructure projects, particularly after some high-profile commercial failures: CLEM7, AirportlinkM7, the Lane Cove Tunnel and the Sydney Cross City Tunnel. It is always a difficult venture when private investors build income-producing assets that might have a life cycle of 30, 50 or 100 years. Private equity firms or other countries' future funds that purchase these assets can make the wrong decisions. The CLEM7 was a classic case of relying on the wrong advice or poor decision making to determine the number of vehicles per day that would make use of it and the income it would generate, and I think there is some ongoing litigation arising from that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation before the chamber aims to encourage private companies to fund and run public infrastructure, particularly transport. It gives an incentive to states and territories to sell assets, including transport infrastructure, and then use the money from the proceeds of the sales to build new productive assets. Fifteen per cent of the asset value of the sale will be used to fund the new infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is $5.9 billion in the Asset Recycling Fund, $2.4 billion of which comes from the Building Australia Fund and $3.5 billion of which comes from the Education Investment Fund. Additional money will come from the sale of Medibank Private. It will be interesting to see whether the kitty will eventually run out. More importantly, it will be interesting to see whether the way governments in the past have traditionally funded public infrastructure—under the ALP it was either 50 per cent or 80 per cent—will be offset by the financial contribution of 15 per cent of the asset value of the sale being used to fund infrastructure, as set out in this legislation. For making decisions about whether an asset will enhance productivity, be good for jobs and be good for the nation, we put our faith in Infrastructure Australia, whereas the coalition seem to have gone for a different mechanism. I have serious concerns about that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the Prime Minister's definition of what an 'infrastructure prime minister' is—I served under two infrastructure prime ministers. Labor has an incredible record when it comes to infrastructure. When we came to government in 2007, Australia was 20th in the OECD in spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP. Under the Labor government, we moved from 20th up to first. We lifted funding from $132 per Australian up to $225 per Australian. A lot of that was through that mechanism of Infrastructure Australia, where people who understand the benefits of infrastructure can research and rank proposals before making a decision. Cross River Rail was number one on that list, but sadly the Newman government walked away from that and has come up with a bit of a dog of a project—the BaT Tunnel.</span>
                </p>

                    </a>  A very costly dog, in fact, that is going to have implications for my community. But at least it is a step towards recognising the economic productivity that comes from investing in public rail, something that this Commonwealth government does not seem to understand. Under Labor, when it came to investing in rail, I am proud to say that we invested more in urban rail infrastructure than every other state government since Federation combined—$13.6 billion. We also invested $3.4 billion in rail freight over the six years we were in government. This means that by 2016 the average trip from Brisbane to Melbourne will be seven hours shorter, and the journey from the east coast to the west coast will be reduced by nine hours. Under Labor we also rebuilt more than one-third of the network—up to 4,000 kilometres of rail track. Contrast that with the opposition, who take a different approach entirely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this legislation, the focus on new, productive infrastructure should be looked at through the prism of the philosophies of the two parties. I believe, and every sensible Commonwealth government would believe, that the Commonwealth should play a lead role when it comes to nation-building infrastructure projects. We cannot just sit back and wait for times of war for the Commonwealth to step in; we should be looking at how we can improve our economy. We should also look at how we improve governance standards when it comes to making decisions that are in the national interest, rather than being connected to that three-year political cycle or to the marginality of seats—letting that determine where projects that benefit a community are going to be located.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Privatisation of one asset to fund a new asset does have some merit. I understand that can be the case in certain circumstances; but these matters should be for the states to determine in open consultation with their communities. This legislation is wholesale: 'You sell something for a billion, we will give you $150 million; you sell something for $2 billion, we will give you $3 million'—up to this $5 billion or $6 billion worth of handouts. This is Commonwealth taxpayers' money being handed out to states for making decisions that they may have made anyway. Obviously, states do make decisions about assets. Governments do. The Commonwealth government used to own the Commonwealth Bank. The Queensland government used to own the Babinda Hotel, which I think is why it has the longest bar in Australia—because it was designed by a public servant. The state government made that decision at the time because they were trying to open up the cane fields. I think the Queensland government even used to own butcher shops, but these things get sold off. The Queensland government even owned the Bellevue Hotel—they bought that in 1967—but decided to knock it down on the night of 20 April 1979. So governments do make decisions about assets, and things then change over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of assets being sold off is not something that the Labor Party is scared of supporting, but we need to look at the process. If you look at the assets owned by states—and I did not get a definition of what the eligible assets would be—the key ones would obviously be power stations and, often, the coalmines located with those power stations. Power stations are income-generating assets, even those dirty brown ones down in Victoria—they still pay a dividend back to the state government, so when people turn on their lights, they are actually paying money to the state government. Other assets include ports—in Queensland, Gladstone and Townsville—and rail lines. I think the rail lines, or certainly what is below the rail, are still owned by the Queensland government. There is water infrastructure, like dams, and there are some state government owned forestry assets as well. I am not sure whether the list of eligible assets would extend to schools—such as Nyanda State High School, a high school in my electorate that sadly was closed down by John-Paul Langbroek, the state education minister—hospitals or even state buildings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the process of turning these things into new, productive infrastructure. We would need to look at what happens when you do sell a state asset. Obviously it depends who it is sold to, but, as I said, it is basically going to be either a private company, another country's future fund—they already own assets here in Australia—or a superannuation fund, either domestic or from another nation. Some of the Canadian superannuation funds certainly like Australian assets because they have a nice, steady return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do they do? As I said, private capital is a bit more expensive than the nation's capital, so they will have to recoup that in charges. They can make some savings in safety and OH&amp;S as much as possible, hopefully within the law. That is one way they can make savings. They also can cut wages and other costs. But the end result for any taking over of a state asset will normally be that the charge associated with that asset will go up—the port charges will go up; the electricity charges will go up; the rail charges will go up. That is just the nature of any privatisation. Whilst the LNP talk about this taxpayer funded privatisation cheer squad bill that they have before the chamber now, they do not mention the fact that the costs associated with this will flow on to every electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start, this is a bit of difference in philosophies between the two parties. The Australian Labor Party is based on the idea of the collective having more power than the individual. We are a social democrat party, but we still believe in profits and markets. It is interesting to look at this legislation and see what it says about the Liberal and National parties, with their focus on the individual and on the market. The true liberals are slowly starting to die out in this House, the National Party aside. The voices of the true liberals—the Sue Boyces of the world—are being taken over by that extremist group, the Tea Party fan club. As the Tea Party fan club slowly take over the philosophy of the Liberal Party, and the National Party are less and less effective in putting forward their views of looking after the bush, it is going to be an interesting battle for the soul of this nation. We have seen the budget that this coalition has handed down—surely one of the cruellest budgets ever, with that focus on the lowest quartile making all the sacrifices, particularly in the bush. It will be an interesting debate. We have two amendments to this legislation, and I ask the LNP to consider those.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KATTER:</span>
                    </a>  I will continue with what I was saying. I spoke about the example of Tasmania, where they went from having the cheapest electricity in the world to probably the most expensive in the world. Tasmania is more expensive than the Australian average. How did that happen? It happened through privatisation. All the same generators and all the same distribution systems are operating. The state has not grown in population, so it is not as if they had to spend money on capital outlays to expand the system. There has been no capital expenditure whatsoever, and yet the price for electricity down there—as in the rest of Australia—is 400 per cent higher than it was prior to corporatisation and then privatisation. How many arguments have you got to put up for the fools in this place to realise that policy must be judged on its outcomes? Surely you cannot come into this place and put up some ideological rubbish that is based upon not a single shred of substantial economic argument or reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you another example, Mr Speaker, used by one of the founders of our little political party, the KAP. The government I was in built the Gateway bridge. We said we would keep the toll on it for 20 years, until it was paid off and each year we also serviced the interest owed to the people who lent us the money. After 20 years, the toll would be taken off and the people would have this magnificent asset that they would own and be able to use for free. Well, two years before the 20 years were up, the ALP government sold the Gateway bridge. Some 100,000 commuters a day use that bridge—and the member for Moreton probably has a lot of constituents who use that bridge. So 100,000 Brisbane people are now paying $50 a week on a tax imposed by the ALP government in privatising that bridge. Let me again quote the member for Mount Isa, a person called Robbie Katter. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When you corporatise—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">or privatise—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">an essential service – you give to that corporation, the right to tax you, at whatever level they feel like, for forever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here it is. The ALP government got themselves $400 million to buy their way through the election—which they won, so it probably did help them. They got $400 million to throw some baubles and blankets to the dumb masses, or 'We'll build you a nice little civic centre in your suburb,' and 100,000 people in Brisbane were taxed at the rate of $50 a week—not $50 a month or $50 a year; $50 a week. That is the taxation that was levied upon those poor people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of corporatising the electricity industry in Queensland is $1,700 per home per year. It is on a continuous growth curve. In fact, that curve now is slanting upwards in Queensland—it is 400 per cent higher now than it was before corporatisation. But even assuming that privatisation does not make that graph steeper—which of course it will—and it stays where it is, the consumers of Queensland will be paying over $6,000 a year for electricity in four years time. But, not only are they not admitting to their mistakes, they are actually compounding, dramatically, their mistakes by forcing the privatisation of everything else in the state of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you another example. In Queensland the state is bankrupt—it was bankrupted by the ALP, but the LNP are spending $51,000 million, 10 per cent more than the ALP spent, so if the ALP were the great bankrupters, the LNP are even greater bankrupters. What are they spending this money on? We just heard about the BaT tunnel, but the Premier is spending $670 million on tearing down a virtually new building—25 years is virtually new: you get a lot more than 20 years out of high-rise construction—and putting in its place an even bigger you-beaut building. The current offices of the Premier, the Deputy Premier, the Treasurer and all of them are in what used to be called the 'Power Tower'. It is the equivalent of the Pentagon—most people understand America better than they understand their own country—and is where the public servants and all the powerful people reside. They are going to tear that building down and get one of their corporate cronies to build a building in its place for $670 million. And they are going to say, 'This is good for the people of Queensland; we can get it for $670 million.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hold on a minute. They have got to get a capex return on that and they have got a maintenance cost, which Treasury says for all buildings is one-seventh of the cost. Then there is the servicing charge on the capex, so that is another 15 per cent. That is $70 million, roughly, plus another $60 million, so up to about $150 million a year. It was costing the people of Queensland virtually nothing for the building that is there. Now they are up $170 million a year so that (a) the Premier can live in even more palatial digs and (b) their corporate donors are going to be looked after with the building of this building. That is the real reason, of course, why we are privatising the assets, so that the big corporations can get hold of an essential service and charge what they like. This is one of the greatest fixes that you have ever seen. There is precedent for it, as I said. In 1215 at a little place called Runnymede in England—some of my forebears, I am told, happened to be there on the day—we said, 'Hold on, Mr King, the Crown doesn't own England, the people own England.' Well, that is not a concept that is abroad in Australia. The concept abroad in Australia is that the Crown owns it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Probably the most important argument of all in a country like Australia is about when you say that the government is out of building development infrastructure. I have listened to about 12 speakers today and every single one of them has referred to 'infrastructure'. In my day, infrastructure was a railway line into the coalfields, it was a port for coal, it was a beef road—that was infrastructure. Not one single speaker today mentioned that sort of infrastructure: development infrastructure. It is a very simple concept to me, as a person who has had cattle all my life. We always say: you can air-condition the living room or you can water the far paddock. You can increase your productivity and your real wealth or you can spend the money on self-indulgence—that is your choice. Every single speaker here today has spoken on self-indulgence. If I can again quote the welterweight champion of north-west Queensland, Robbie Katter, he asked: 'What do you get for the BaT tunnel?'—that tunnel that was referred to by the previous speaker in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is broke in Queensland, but they can find $1,000 million to build a new pleasure dome for themselves and they can find $5,000 million for yet another tunnel in Brisbane—which, I might add, brings this so-called infrastructure to 24 kilometres of tunnelling in Brisbane. Melbourne has got hardly any tunnelling. Sydney, with five million people, has only got 14 kilometres of tunnelling. But Brisbane, with a little over one million people, has got 24 kilometres. But let me go back what Robbie Katter said when he asked what you get for that $5,000 million: 'I'll tell you what you get for the $5,000 million. What you get is an extra four minutes of viewing time on your television at night.' A few thousand people in Brisbane will get to watch television for about an extra four minutes a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If that $6,000 million that they are spending on the 'Taj Mahal' and the BaT tunnel had been used to build the railway line into the Galilee Basin, coal would now be moving out of the Galilee Basin, which holds half of Australia's coal reserves. That coal would be moving if the railway had been built not by private development, not by Gina Rinehart nor by Adani, but by the government, the people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To understand this we have to turn the clock back to 1960. In that year in Australia there was great consternation because we again had to import coal from overseas. We were a coal importing country in 1960, and I can refer you to a number of books if you want to question me on that. Probably the best is on the 'microeconomics of developmentalism' by the dean of the faculty at ANU, but I can quote you many other books.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were a coal-importing country. How did we go from being a coal-importing country, within 10 or 15 years, to being the biggest coal-exporting country on earth? How did we do that? I will tell you how we did that, because I was there at the time. We built a railway line. The government—the people—built a multi-user facility. We could have said to Utah, 'If you want a railway line you build it.' If they had built it they most certainly would not have let Theiss on that railway line, nor any of the other Australian companies, like BHP. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a decision taken by Charles Court in Western Australia. The very, very great Australian Andrew Forrest has said that development was held up by 15 or 20 years in iron ore because BHP was forced to build the railway line themselves. Naturally they said, 'It's our railway line; no-one else is going to use it.' So no-one else could. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland it was a multi-user facility. When the government's total income was around $3,000 million a year we borrowed $1,000 million and built the railway line. That is why you have a coal industry today. Nearly 30 per cent of this nation's total income from overseas, for the last 50 years, has come from coal. Why do we have the coal industry?—because an enlightened government said, 'No; we don't believe in free markets, non-free markets, privatisation or non-privatisation. We don't understand any of this ideological rubbish. There's a whole stack of people who want to mine coal. None of them individually has the money to build a railway line. If someone individually builds a railway line that will be his railway line and he can screw everybody or stop them from using it.' We said, 'That's a stupid idea; we'll build the railway line.' So we built the railway line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rest is history; Queensland became the greatest coal-exporting state on earth, producing $50,000 million in terms of today's money, every single year, for the Australian economy and the people of Queensland. We did that, and we did it by building a railway line. It would have been anathema to the people in those governments. We were considered the most right-wing government in Australia. So I do not know what right wing and left wing mean. All I know is that Adam Bandt is considered very left wing and I am considered very right wing. We both agree on one thing: this country was built by government building the ports, the railways and those assets that were necessary for the development of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You may say that private enterprise can do it. Private enterprise would do it for their own selfish interests. If Mr Adani is allowed to build the railway line in Queensland and he owns that railway line then that would not facilitate growth; it would facilitate profits for him. Under section 457 visas, which were introduced by the ALP—do not let them criticise the Liberal Party—and which the Liberal Party say they are going to double, we will get little to no benefit at all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a>  I would firstly like to address Labor's claims that there is no additional money for roads. We are investing in major new road projects and accelerating the delivery of existing ones right across the country. That includes our $3 billion commitment to East West Link stage 1 and stage 2, both of which were opposed by Labor. When both sections are complete, the East West Link will make a meaningful difference to the transport challenges facing Melbourne and will improve connectivity across the Victorian capital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the $1.5 billion the Australian government has committed to the eastern section, the Commonwealth government has also committed $1½ billion to accelerate delivery of the western section to enable the full benefits of the overall East West Link to be realised sooner. The western section of the East West Link was submitted to Infrastructure Australia in 2011 and was assessed as having real potential, meaning that the project addressed a nationally significant problem and is expected to improve freight efficiency and access to the Port of Melbourne. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government funding for the western section of the East West Link is contingent on the Victorian government submitting an updated business case to Infrastructure Australia for consideration in its 2014 infrastructure priority list and commencement of work by the end of 2015. The Victorian government has provided an interim business case on the western section to Infrastructure Australia. So claims of there being no analysis of the project are just disingenuous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am always pleased when those opposite decide to show an interest in rural and regional Australia. They certainly did not do much of that in the six years of government between 2007 and 2013. If they had visited rural and regional Australia recently they would know that there is a great deal of support for our $564½ billion commitment to the Black Spot program and the reintroduction of the successful Roads to Recovery program, which involves a landmark commitment of $2.4 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to be in Queanbeyan just last week to see the Acting Prime Minister and New South Wales Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner announce a joint funding commitment of $50 million to build the Queanbeyan bypass. The bypass will take the pressure off the existing road network, particularly in the central business district, and improve safety for residents. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we are told that there is no money for public transport, when right across the nation since the federal election state governments have recommitted to investing more than $25 billion in major public transport projects. The member for Grayndler also referred to the government's plans to restore independence, transparency and credibility to Infrastructure Australia. He did not quite put it in those terms, but he was certainly referring to legislation which is currently before the Senate to improve the governance of Infrastructure Australia. This government wants Infrastructure Australia to be able to get on with the job of strategically assessing the nation's infrastructure. It is true that Infrastructure Australia produces a priorities list. But it is really just a list of projects it has assessed. It is outdated before it is even published. We want an Infrastructure Australia to be able to help shape priorities and inform decisions rather than simply play catch-up, and we are giving Infrastructure Australia real work to do, conducting an initial audit of infrastructure assets right across the nation and an audit every five years as well as developing a rolling 15-year plan. If the opposition is so keen on cost benefits analysis, why did it fail so miserably to do its sums on its own national broadband network—another example of the Labor mess which we have been left to clean up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were claims about state fire sales. It is disappointing to hear those opposite engage in fearmongering about the possibility of a fire sale of state government infrastructure assets. That is not what it is about. This fund is a response to the reality that state governments are not divesting themselves of assets which can be more efficiently managed by the private sector to free up resources for new infrastructure projects on behalf of people who live in those states. Even in the presence of the Asset Recycling Fund, there are clear incentives for state governments, New South Wales included, to be carefully considering divestment decisions, having regard to the appetite of the market for assets and the views of the community for asset sales, and that is important. The views of the community are very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to speak on an infrastructure idea very, very dear to my heart—high-speed rail. I think you will find that it nicely encapsulates much of what was lacking in Labor's approach to infrastructure. The member for Grayndler's own high-speed rail study showed that the priority for governments should be protecting the potential high-speed rail corridor and to do that requires engagement with the states and the Australian Capital Territory. The member for Grayndler's response was to absolutely splurge $52 million on a high-speed rail authority. This government is about reducing red tape. The member for Kooyong is getting on with the great job of doing that and not creating it by adding unnecessary levels of governance and complexity for work that can be achieved without it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government supports the idea of high-speed rail—of course we do and we are very much behind it—but we recognise that in the near term the most effective action is to engage the states as well is the ACT on the suitability of their legislation and budgets to preserve a corridor for high-speed rail. The government, ably led in this area by the Deputy Prime Minister, will continue to work within its means to seek agreement and the ongoing support of the governments of Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT and Victoria before committing to implement high-speed rail. It should be noted that other than Labor's $52 million red tape commitment to high-speed rail, it set aside no money to implement high-speed rail over the forward estimates. I repeat: there was no money for high-speed rail over the forward estimates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In planning to meet Australia's future transport needs, it is important to consider all transport modes, aviation, road, conventional rail and high-speed rail, to determine the best approach for Australia's unique conditions and to optimise regional development benefits. High-speed rail between Melbourne and Brisbane is expected to cost $114 billion. Labor delivered almost $200 billion of deficits. This government is lumped with $1 billion a month in interest on that debt. It is actually not the government, it is the people we serve, the people we represent—and Labor forgot those people—who have to pay that interest. The money we spend, which the people have to spend on interest, could go towards a whole range of important uses including building a high-speed rail network. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are getting on with the job of also building an inland freight rail. We are getting on with the task of constructing the long-awaited inland freight rail between Brisbane and Melbourne, appointing former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson chair of the implementation group to make it happen. This will enable freight to be moved from one capital to the other in just over 27 hours. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Labor is moving amendments to the bill to tie the Asset Recycling Fund up in endless red tape with lots of toing and froing, further proof that Labor's answer to everything is more government red tape not real government action. These amendments should not and will not be supported. The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and consequential amendments establish a new fund as a vehicle for providing financial assistance and incentives to states and territories to invest in important infrastructure. A new fund is necessary to support the government's Asset Recycling Initiative, a key initiative which will encourage states and territories to sell existing assets and reinvest in new infrastructure which contributes to a more prosperous economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw that the New South Wales government are getting on with the job. Their budget announced this week by the member for Bega, Andrew Constance, is getting on with the job of paying back Labor's debt and getting on with the job of recycling assets with the help of and in collaboration with the Commonwealth to help boost productivity opportunities for the people in New South Wales. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Payments from the Asset Recycling Fund will also be used to fund nation building infrastructure and other national partnership agreements. Payments to other bodies will be administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development and will support important local initiatives such as the Roads to Recovery program, and we know how important that is particularly in regional areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Establishing a new fund to support the government's infrastructure package is sound economic policy. It allows funds being committed now to be invested so that more is available when payments become due. Entrusting the Asset Recycling Fund to the Future Fund Board of Guardians will maximise the growth of assets. The board has a proven track record in managing assets on behalf of the taxpayer. It has grown the Future Fund from around $64 billion in 2006 to more than $97 billion by the end of March 2014. The government is committed to the new fund. It will be established with $5.9 billion funded by amounts from the Education Investment and Building Australia funds not allocated to approved projects. The government will make further contributions following the successful privatisation of Medibank Private. Should we decide to engage in future asset sales, then those proceeds may also be contributed to the fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to respond to a couple of items that have been raised during the debate by Labor members. On the matter of the South Australian funding raised by the member for Makin, I need to quote from a letter to local government in that particular state from the Deputy Prime Minister. The letter said, 'The local government financial assistance grants program will not be indexed for three years and this special road grant to South Australian councils, which expires this year, will not be renewed. The additional funding for infrastructure investments along with Roads to Recovery, bridges renewal and black spot programs, is expected to offset those decisions.' That word 'offset' is very important, because it means they will not miss out. They are benefiting enormously from the programs that the coalition government has put into place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the member for Chifley making all sorts of allegations and concerns about Badgerys Creek. How does this government plan to meet Sydney's aviation demand? What is this government doing to build the infrastructure of the 21st century for Western Sydney? The answer to those questions is that we are getting on with building Western Sydney's first airport. Some might like to say it is Sydney's second airport, but it is Western Sydney's first airport. For more than 50 years, governments of all persuasions have talked about a second airport for Sydney, a first airport for Western Sydney. This coalition government—this Liberal-Nationals government—has ended the indecision. We have stopped the dithering and locked in Badgerys Creek as the site for Western Sydney's airport. The talk is over. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is getting on with the job—getting on with the job of paying back the debt and getting on with the job of building important infrastructure. That is why this particular debate is so important. This decision about Badgerys Creek is good for the economy, it is good for jobs and it is good for tourism. Most importantly, it is good for Western Sydney, and certainly the member for Chifley should get on board. The airport will be a major catalyst for investment and jobs growth in the region for decades to come. While the initial construction phase is expected to create up to 4,000 jobs, tens of thousands of additional jobs will be created as the airport grows over time. There will be 35,000 jobs by 2035, increasing to more than 60,000 by the year 2060. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that sounds a long way off, but do not take my word for it—where do these figures come from? Ernst and Young analysed the employment benefits of an airport at Badgerys Creek as part of a report, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Study of Wilton and RAAF Base Richmond for Civil Aviation Operations</span>, and this analysis was based on a review of domestic and international literature on employment created by airports and a comparison of actual employment benefits of airports around the world. So we are looking at tens of thousands of jobs. That is going to revitalise Western Sydney and is going to provide so many great opportunities for industry, for business, for tourism and for the constituents of the member for Chifley and others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are getting on with the jobs of paying back Labor's debt. We are getting on with the job of paying back the debt and deficit legacy that we have been left after six years of Labor. In response to the member for Moreton's query about the eligibility of assets, the incentive will be determined under the national partnership agreement. Had he been listening, he certainly would have been on board with that part of this particular piece of legislation. The Asset Recycling Fund is an essential element of the government's infrastructure package announced in the 2014-15 budget to support economic growth. That 13 May statement by the member for North Sydney, the Treasurer, called 'the budget' is getting on with the job of rebuilding Australia in infrastructure and in paying down the debt. We are getting on with the job because that is what Australians expect us to do. Contrary to what those opposite would have you believe, the government has increased overall infrastructure spending between 2013-14 and 2018-19 by $16.4 billion. That is a substantial commitment in a tough fiscal environment. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments improve governance around the way in which grants are made from this so-called Asset Recycling Fund. Amendment (2) consolidates infrastructure approvals with the minister for infrastructure. The range of infrastructure that can be approved is not restricted. Amendments (3) and (6) are critical amendments that place proper process around approvals given to projects by the infrastructure minister. These are preconditions to grants or payments from the Asset Recycling Fund, including under the Asset Recycling Initiative. That initiative proposes a Commonwealth contribution to a state or territory totalling 15 per cent of the reinvested proceeds from a privatisation. The bill provides no criteria for deciding how scarce Commonwealth funds will be prioritised to competing projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's amendments propose to fix that. As the Parliamentary Library has noted in its <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills Digest</span>, the strong selection criteria that Labor applied under the Building Australia Fund has not been replicated in this bill. As this bill proposes to empty out the BAF and the EIF, which also had very strict criteria around them, these amendments that Labor is moving will retain independent and transparent approvals processes around project selection. This retains the rigor that Labor had in place under the BAF and the EIF, nothing less. Good governance follows the money. It is absolutely critical that this process be got right. If these amendments are not carried it will be a blank cheque to fund whatever they like out of the Asset Recycling Fund, whether or not it represents value for money for the Australian taxpayer, a good outcome in terms of productivity, and a good outcome in terms of jobs and economic growth. That is why we put in place the structures around the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite do not seem to get the idea that it is fundamental that we have proper processes in place and that money from the Commonwealth goes to where it will have the most impact on the economy, not on the margin of electorates. That is why we are moving these amendments, because we have seen with projects like the Perth Freight Link project, no cost-benefit analysis, no plans and no detail in terms of environmental assessment. Indeed, the WA parliamentary secretary responsible in the estimates process in the last week has called upon federal ministers to stop with their rhetoric without any detail. And that is the problem with this government's approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are absolutely consistent with the government's stated position, which is that for all projects above $100 million there has to be a proper assessment. These amendments are also consistent with the broad call for independence and transparency of project advice from important stakeholders such as the Business Council of Australia, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, the Urban Development Institute, the Bus Industry Confederation and the Tourism and Transport Forum. They are consistent also with Labor's foreshadowed amendments to the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill and those we have already moved to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments align with the Productivity Commission's recent finding in its interim report on the funding of public infrastructure, where they say:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The overriding message of this draft report is the need for a comprehensive overhaul of processes in the assessment and development of public infrastructure projects.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of either a grant, amendment (3), or a payment, amendment (6), to a state, territory or other entity, the infrastructure minister must first have received an evaluation of the project from Infrastructure Australia and advice from it that the project is likely to produce productivity gains. IA's evaluation must include a cost-benefit analysis of the project. Of course, that must be transparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, for a project involving the privatisation of a state or territory owned asset and recycling of the proceeds into another asset, the infrastructure minister cannot recommend a project unless the Treasurer has approved the privatisation transaction as eligible for a Commonwealth contribution from the Asset Recycling Fund. The mechanism for this approval will be via a disallowable instrument for each transaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This proposed change reflects Labor's view that there are good and bad privatisations. We do not believe, unlike those opposite, that privatisation is good on each and every occasion. Nor do the Australian people, which is why we are not prepared to give a blank cheque, politically or economically, to those opposite with this existing flawed legislation. Labor believes, for example, that the Commonwealth should not reward states who are selling assets in a fire sale or without adequate regulatory protections. We on this side of the House have a balanced approach to these issues. If the government were at all fair dinkum, they would be supporting these amendments that we foreshadowed to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen over in the other place this week that the government had to fold their position on the Infrastructure Australia legislation because there was such pressure from those in the business community and others who understand infrastructure policy. The legislation that they had there was about undermining the independence of Infrastructure Australia. They gagged debate on the Infrastructure Australia bills last year. They still have not begun debate in the Senate and it is now June. That is how prepared they were to avoid scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members might remember being here till after 11 pm on the night they gagged that legislation, even though there was no urgency whatsoever. The fact that the government will not bring those bills on until next week confirms that. But these amendments go to the same principles—the same principles that the government talks about but will do anything to stop from being in the legislation. These amendments should be supported by this House. The opposition commends the amendments that I have moved.</span>

We did not see too much good governance with anything, and certainly when it came to infrastructure. The member for Grayndler, who was then the minister for regional development and the minister for infrastructure, changed the funding for state roads and particularly the Pacific Highway. I think we share a common view that it needs to be upgraded. We do share a common view there, but the funding formula was changed such that it would be 50 per cent Commonwealth and 50 per cent state, whereas in the past it was 80 per cent from the Commonwealth and 20 per cent from New South Wales.</span>

In the past six months, this Commonwealth Liberal-Nationals government has boosted job numbers by more than 100,000. We have heard the infrastructure Prime Minister talk about that in question time. The member for Grayndler, the shadow minister at the table, was obviously not listening when the Prime Minister talked about the 100,000 jobs created by this side in the past six months. That is getting on with the job of helping Australia grow and helping pay back Labor's debt. If it were left unchecked, we all know—that side might not get it but the Australian public get it—it would be $667 billion. That is $1 billion each and every month in interest payments. This cannot continue—and it will not continue, because the adults are now in charge. It is six months today since we saw a boat illegally arrive on our shores. I digress. This Asset Recycling Fund is an important initiative. It has specific purposes which are consistent with the government's investment in productivity-enhancing infrastructure. This includes making funding available for the Asset Recycling Initiative and also the Infrastructure Growth Package. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is necessary legislation. It is a mechanism which allows money to flow from realised investments through to the COAG Reform Fund, special account, and the infrastructure portfolio special account—things that are getting on with the job of building productivity for our nation and creating jobs and wealth not just for the cities but also for the regional areas—those regional areas which provide all the food and fibre, which I think sometimes our city-centric MPs forget. It is about getting on with the job of building the valuable infrastructure left so badly behind by Labor in its six years of government. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  I think the proposed amendments for tighter controls put forward by Labor are pretty reasonable. I cannot speak to this legislation without giving examples. Money was spent in Queensland—and in Australia, for that matter—to build railway lines into the coalfields. That is how we got the coal industry. This was infrastructure to develop and create jobs and real wealth for this nation. Then money was used to build power stations for aluminium. It was not squandered on self-indulgence or on winning votes in Queensland. There were no votes at a little place called Gladstone—there was no-one living there at the time. This is how we got the aluminium industry and beef roads industry. They are major export items. Beef was not really very important at all until the great Jack McEwen built the 'beef road scheme'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another good example is my cattle station and other blocks of land that I own. I and a friend owned half a million acres. On that half a million acres I do not think any cattle had ever been run properly. There was not one inch of fencing on 500,000 acres back in 1973, 1974 or whenever it was. The bloke on the neighbouring station, Esmeralda, sold it because he thought: 'What's the use of owning a station if you can't get into or out of it?' When the roads were built, we realised that these places, which had been—to quote the great Slim Dusty—'land wasted' were not land wasted at all. It was not wasted land; it had just been land that was wasted until we put the development there. The coal industry and the aluminium industry have been on average two of the biggest export items for the last 50 years, and then there were the beef roads. They were all created by infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not think these amendments will be particularly effective because I think there will be a continuation of the spending. To again quote Robbie Katter: 'What did you get for your $5,000 million tunnel? A few thousand people getting home four minutes earlier to watch television.' One of the leading economists in this country—I think it was John Quiggin—referred to 'tunnel vision'. Governments today cannot see the potential of a coal industry, an ethanol industry, an aluminium industry or a beef industry. They cannot see that. All they know is that they will get to work a bit faster or get home a bit faster. That is the size of their vision for their country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be very specific: my great-grandad got on a ship to America and, out of his own money, bought two huge cranes to give to the Port of Townsville. He hoped that the board, which he was a member of, would pay him back, and they did as luck would have it. But he had no authority to do what he did, and if they had not paid him, well, at least we would have a port in North Queensland. Those two great cranes created that port. His grandson, my father, and his cousin, who was chairman, served on the Townsville Port Authority. So we had a vested interest in the port authority. The point I am coming to is that the government is going to sell the port. Already major industries in North Queensland are organising to build another port somewhere else, because, if the port is privately owned, the private owner can charge whatever they like. People are not going to go to a port where they can be charged anything that the owner wants to charge them. This is a multi-user government facility, and the government has a responsibility to provide the service at a reasonable charge to everybody. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The other issue is that, if Mount Isa Mines dominate that port and effectively control it—under private enterprise arrangements they might be the owner—they are not going to let their competitors use that port—of course they aren't. Once again, as the member for Melbourne said previously, the people built that port—great people like my great-grandad—out of their own money and their own time. It took him almost a year to get over there and buy the cranes and then come back again—six months, anyway, in those days. These people did that willingly because it was the right thing to do. The port is bringing in $38.5 million a year. The railway line, which is up for sale, is bringing in $450 million. So $500 million a year is now going to go to a private corporation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I cannot let the comments of the parliamentary secretary go unchallenged, given that he failed to address the substance of the amendments. He made statements about the Pacific Highway that simply do not stand up to scrutiny. The fact is that during the period of the Howard government the federal contribution to the Pacific Highway was $1.3 billion and during those same years the state government contribution from the New South Wales Labor government was $2.5 billion—almost two-thirds of the funding for the Pacific Highway came from the state government. The previous federal coalition government took for granted the people who live in electorates along the Pacific Highway. I did not, as a minister, and nor did the federal Labor government. As part of the economic stimulus plan, we invested massively in the Pacific Highway. During the six years I was a minister, there was additional funding for the Pacific Highway in every single budget from 2008 through to 2013, totalling $7.9 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Page 13 of the 2013-14 budget papers shows a graph that outlines Pacific Highway projects. This year's coalition budget papers, on page 17 of the 'Building Australia's infrastructure' document, also contain a graph of Pacific Highway projects. They are exactly the same—every single project. There is not one extra dollar from this government for the Pacific Highway in the budget. What is worse, it has let state governments off the hook. The coalition's colleagues in New South Wales have withdrawn funding that they had allocated for the Pacific Highway, along which they hold every single seat in New South Wales. Every metre of the highway, from the Harbour Bridge to the Queensland border, is held by a New South Wales coalition member. They cut funding in their midyear forecast because they got the green light from a National Party minister, the member for Wide Bay, who is asleep when it comes to this issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Have a look at the list of projects in the coalition's own budget papers: Banora Point upgrade, completed late 2012; Ballina bypass, completed in 2012; Devils Pulpit upgrade, completed; Glenugie upgrade, completed; and Kempsey bypass, completed and opened in 2013—fully funded, 100 per cent, by the Commonwealth government as part of the economic stimulus plan and involving the largest road bridge in Australia. Herons Creek to Stills Road was completed in 2013 along with the Bulahdelah bypass. Then there are the projects under way. Tintenbar to Ewingsdale is more than half completed—it is funded by previous budgets and will be completed next year. Sapphire to Woolgoolga is just about completed, and perhaps it has been completed by now. It was due for completion now. It was fully funded. Construction on the Nambucca Heads to Urunga and Warrell Creek to Nambucca Heads sections has all begun. They were funded in previous budgets. I turned the first sod on the Frederickton to Euangi construction last year. Kundabung to Kempsey and Oxley Highway to Kundabung construction is commencing this year, funded in previous budgets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not a single new project on the Pacific Highway from this mob opposite—not one. We have the ridiculous circumstances of the member for Lyne asking questions about this. The previous member for Lyne delivered on the Pacific Highway, as did members of the Labor Party. The coalition did not. All they have done is give a free pass to their coalition colleagues in New South Wales. They will maintain existing federal funding but because of a reduction in state government funding the project will be completed later than it would have been otherwise. It is to the National Party's shame that they have allowed that to happen.</span>

                    </a>  And ours, but at the end of the day the important thing is that we do need, as a government and as an opposition, to get on with the job of building the Pacific Highway. We need to do it to save lives. I know that the member for Grayndler is genuine in his desire to build the Pacific Highway, and I did hear in my first term of parliament a very passionate and emotional speech by him about the personal reasons he wants a particular stretch of highway funded to save lives. It is critical that we do save lives. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I realise I am not talking about the amendments, but I do take exception to the comments he made about the current member for Lyne. I know the current member for Lyne is committed, as we all should be, to getting on with the job of duplicating that stretch of road. It is vital. Far too many lives have been lost on that highway for far too long. This government, through its infrastructure projects and because of the absolute necessity to build roads for the 21st century, is getting on with the job and is providing more money than has ever been provided in the past to build the roads of the 21st century. The actions of the Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of The Nationals and member for Wide Bay will ensure we are doing just that. We oppose these amendments.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I go to the amendments and why it is important to have a proper process around the allocation of any funding arising from this legislation. I go to the issue of the Perth Freight Link project. I ask the parliamentary secretary to consider these issues seriously when he considers the amendments that I have moved. In the budget there is a considerable allocation of money for the so-called Perth Freight Link project. I was surprised because infrastructure projects tend not to just pop out of a Weeties packet in the morning, they tend to be the subject of a long-term development process. There is engagement at the bureaucratic and at ministerial level. I had a good relationship, I must say, with Troy Buswell, the WA transport minister, and we engaged regularly about our common interests over projects like the Gateway WA project, for example, that has been under construction for two years but which the government is pretending has just begun in the last two minutes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Perth Freight Link project therefore surprised me when it popped out just prior to the budget. But it appears that I was not the only one who was surprised; the WA government were pretty surprised about it as well. There has been almost $1 billion allocated for this project but this is what the WA parliamentary secretary with responsibility for transport, the Hon. Jim Chown, had to say to questions in the estimates process of the Standing Committee on Estimates and Financial Operations in the WA parliament just last week, on Thursday, 12 June. In response to questions about Freight Link he said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Look, it is a bit too early to give a breakdown. It is still under development in regard to the Perth Freight Link.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the Hon. Jim Chown. Then he was asked about more detail, and he said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The commonwealth has a propensity to make these announcements, as you well know, but the reality is that the Main Roads department and this government will be implementing and designing the Roe 8 extension, and at this stage we have not actually got design plans that are worthy of public scrutiny, as the director has stated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to state some quite extraordinary positions. When asked, he said that all options are on the table because they just had not got any detail. Ken Travers, Labor's transport spokesperson in WA, said about the Commonwealth that they must have had conversations with the WA government. Again, the Hon. Jim Chown said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Maybe that is a question you should be asking a commonwealth government representative. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was quite extraordinary evidence given. For example, on the claims that have been made by the government, Mr Travers asked:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So you are not in a position to provide any modelling to show that 65,000 heavy vehicles will be taken off Perth roads? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hon. Jim Chown responded:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not at this stage, and I think the director general has stated his reasoning really well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question from Ken Travers was: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Would it be helpful, then, for the commonwealth minister to stop making claims that cannot be backed up and that you do not have the evidence to support? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the answer from the WA Liberal Party member of the executive responsible for transport to this committee: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The simple answer in the context of the conversation would be yes! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here you have the WA coalition government saying can the federal government stop talking through its hat with regard to infrastructure projects, because the detail simply has not been done. What we argue is that you do the planning, you get the detail, you get the economic assessment and then you determine where the funding should go. What this amendment before the parliament today does is ensure that the government's rhetoric is able to be implemented. It is as simple as that, and I do not understand why the government is not supporting these amendments. I commend them to the House.</span>

This is consistent with concerns that have been raised by many stakeholders. It is also consistent with coalition policy. So what I say to the coalition is: vote for your policy which you said before the election you support. These amendments before the House should be supported. They will improve what is flawed legislation. I commend them to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  It is difficult to recall a government with as poor an environmental record as the Abbott government. Last night the World Heritage Committee rebuked the Prime Minister's environmental measures and gave the government one year to improve its management of the Great Barrier Reef before reconsidering whether to have it listed as in danger. The Great Barrier Reef is an asset for all Australians, but it is being treated with abandon by this government—a government that is walking away from the hard science on climate change in favour of the lunatic fringe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are members of this government who do not believe that the planet is warming, who believe that climate change is a great hoax of the Bureau of Meteorology, the CSIRO and NASA. Members of the government share the view of this weathervane Prime Minister that climate change is, as he put it, 'absolute crap'. The Prime Minister has held many views on many issues. He has famously flipped his view on paid parental leave, once saying he would only support it over his dead body and now casting it as his signature move. He said there would be no cuts to the pension, health or education and has now backflipped on that. As the member for Wentworth has noted, he has held every possible position on climate change. The time for cheap talk on climate change must be over. We need hard science and good economics to guide decisions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  The other night in Darwin the 116th anniversary of the proclamation of Philippine independence was celebrated with an event called Celebrating the Renaissance of Filipino Pride: Our Values, Faith, Culture. It was an event put on by the Filipino Australian Association of the Northern Territory. It was a pleasure to attend this event with the Top End's Filipino community, a group that continues to improve and expand the multicultural fabric of Darwin and Palmerston. I would like to take the time to congratulate the executive committee members on a job well done. Special mention goes to President Oscar Parian, Vice President JudithVentic, Secretary Lourdes Valles, Treasurer Mary Anne Samson and committee members Elsi Barretto, Matthew Mitchel, Ron Greaves, Marcos Pastor, Mary Anne Bernabe-Laurel, Primae Matuguina, Ingrid Vollmer, Annalee Boholst and Malix Laurel. It was an awesome event. As always with the Filipino community of the Northern Territory, they know how to have a good time. There was lots of wonderful food. There was some great music. There was some singing and lots of dancing. Once again, I would like to thank the Filipino community for involving me in their celebrations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Friends of Youth Mental Health, today I welcome HighWater Theatre from Wodonga to Canberra. HighWater is an arts based program for high-risk young people, aged between 12 and 15. These young people are out of school, involved with juvenile justice, child protection and youth welfare agencies in the Wodonga area. Yesterday this group delivered a performance of a compelling new play <span style="font-style:italic;">Mindfields … burns too bright</span>. The play looks at what we often fail to acknowledge—the issues surrounding youth mental health. It is a story which illustrates how:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">“Kids like us don’t walk in a straight line &amp; although we try, we try so hard—we don’t always arrive at the destination posts at your designated times.”</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The play is filled with music, singing, movement, high energy and humour, and it cuts deeply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In bringing this play to Canberra, the group hopes to increase discussion on the vexed issue of youth mental health. HighWater Theatre is a joint initiative between Somebody's Daughter Theatre Company, Gateway Community Health, the department of education and training in Victoria, and the Australia Council. As always with such things, it takes a team effort to make it happen. Congratulations to all involved—staff, young people, families and the many who donated via Chuffed. I would particularly like to thank my colleague Clive Palmer and Minister Pyne for the attention and wonderful welcome they gave these young people.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  I rise today to congratulate seven students across the O'Connor electorate who have been awarded an Australian Vocational Student Prize. The AVSP is one of the nation's top prizes for year 12 students undertaking Vocational Education and Training in School. It recognises year 12 students from 2013 who excelled while undertaking this program or an Australian school based apprenticeship. Seven O'Connor students are among 500 students who received the award across the nation. This recognises the skill, commitment and achievements of school students who take on vocational education in their final year of school. My congratulations go to: Peron Pearse from Great Southern Grammar; Adrian Beer and Tyson Introvigne from Denmark's WA College of Agriculture; Sarah Michael from North Albany Senior High School; Amanda Devenish and Georgia Ryan from Esperance Senior High School; and Jeremy Martyn from Manjimup Senior High School.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These students are not just ambassadors for their schools but for the first-class career opportunities that high-quality vocational education and training in school can provide. The future prosperity of our economy very much depends on a highly skilled workforce. It is great to see this generation given an opportunity to pursue a trade or training while at school before deciding on a future career. The AVSP is a great example of how we are committed to delivering a Vocational Education and Training in School system with stronger links to industry and training providers, ensuring our graduates get high-quality, on-the-job training that equips them with the skills that employers need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  The Prime Minister claims to be a conservationist Yet 'Abbott the Conservationist' has ripped half a billion dollars out of Landcare programs designed for conservation. What has been the effect of these cuts? Most of the funding will be cut from future rounds of local community based Landcare projects, the same work that is now being allocated to be done by the Green Army. It is the basic bait-and-switch retail trick where you advertise a product at a good price and then dump it and switch it with a product that is inferior or more expensive. Under this budget, the bait is Landcare and the switch is the Green Army.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">For a quarter of a century, Landcare has made Australia a better place, yet the scale of the task ahead is significant.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree with the CEO of the Farmers' Federation. I call on the Nationals, who are supposed to be the political wing of the Farmers' Federation and a voice for farmers in this House, to stand up for their base and be a strong voice on this issue. The government should restore the funding to Landcare so it can do its conservation work. It is time the Prime Minister actually stood by what he said and became the conservationist that this country needs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  On the Thursday before the state election, South Australian Labor put up a particularly dishonest poster, saying that the Liberals would cut Flinders neonatal unit and saying, 'Don't trust the Liberals with our hospitals.' It was not the worst thing they did during the election campaign, but it was an example of their dishonest tactics. What we are seeing now in the South Australian budget to be released this afternoon is that the South Australian Labor government are cutting $284 million in upgrades at four major hospitals, with $125 million cut from the upgrade to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital; $100 million cut from the Flinders Medical Centre; $27.8 million cut from the Modbury Hospital; and $31.3 million cut from Noarlunga. These were state Labor promises. This was state government money.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter of record and a matter of fact that hospital funding for South Australia from the Commonwealth government is increasing every year. It will increase by $70 million over the next year. So what we are seeing again from South Australian Labor is that they say one thing before an election and do another after. They said one thing only three months ago and are doing another in government. This is a disgrace. They ran a dishonest campaign and now we see that they will be ripping $284 million from hospitals— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If he is such a great conservationist, how can he allow alpine grazing and cattle grazing back into a national park? How can he turn a national park into a paddock? If this is a government that is built on conservationist issues, how can it allow this absurdity to happen? But it has. On 6 March 2014 the so-called federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, approved the Victorian government's application for a new cattle grazing trial in the Wonnangatta Valley, part of the National Heritage listed Alpine National Park. It is a National Heritage alpine park; it is not a paddock. Why are we allowing these cattle back into this environment? It is just destroying this environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no so-called scientific evidence to this trial. It is a complete farce. The bushfire royal commission did not ask for it, there is no peer reviewed scientific evidence for it, the site contains rare native vegetation, there has been no pre-trial fauna survey and there has been no consideration of locations outside the national park, which do exist, for the three families—literally—who benefit from this trial.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I met with the Newman Primary School students and teachers there was a fantastic level of excitement, and I was definitely given the rock star treatment. Students were full of questions on the life of a politician, and of the 42 students and teachers in attendance I must have shaken the majority of these young people's hands. It was also great to see that there were plenty of budding politicians, particularly amongst the young girls in this group, with all students a fantastic reflection of their school community and deputy principal, Helen Metcalfe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee expressed serious concern and regret with the Abbott government's decision to allow the dumping of three million cubic metres of dredge spoil in reef waters at Abbot Point. This might have come as a surprise to some, who had heard our Prime Minister proudly proclaim that he was a conservationist. It is worth considering exactly what kind of conservationist the Prime Minister is.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a conservationist who has handed over federal environmental approval powers to state governments and local councils, creating inconsistency, uncertainty and removing federal oversight from decisions about some of our greatest natural assets. He is a conservationist who is campaigning not for an Australian icon to be added to the World Heritage List but to be removed. In an unprecedented act, the Prime Minister wants part of the Tasmanian wilderness to be stripped of its world heritage ranking.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is a conservationist who chose as one of his very first acts as Prime Minister to dismantle the biggest marine reserve network in the world. He is a conservationist who does not see the need for urgent action on climate change and who instead wants to remove the price on carbon and replace it with a half-hearted scheme that will cost billions and achieve little.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Local government expenditure accounts for more than half of environmental spending across Australia's three spheres of government, and more than a quarter of local government's total annual expenditure. These federal government department figures show that local government is doing the heavy lifting in the environment in this country. The PM, in his surprising remake as a conservationist, should then be very concerned about the $925 million cut to local government and the impact that this will have on important environmental work across the nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more concerning must be the impact of today's High Court decision in the second Williams case. This is a decision that will threaten the 20 per cent of federal government funds that come directly from the federal government to local government. We can no longer delay putting local government funding on a sound basis and ensuring that local government can continue to deliver critical services across our community.</span>

Their behaviour last year in playing ducks and drakes on their support was shameful. We now need to rebuild this consensus and put local government into the centre of our Constitution.</span>

I would like to acknowledge them by name: Naomi Hastings, Meg D'Souza, Amelia Anthony, Alex, Lachsz, Amanda Windsor, Arun Krishnan and, in addition to that, Josephine Parsons, who represents my local University of Western Sydney action group. They are remarkable, genuine conservationists who care about the world now and about leaving it in good order for the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast that to the government's action, where supposed conservationists rip away at our very capacity to act on climate change by attempting to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Compare it too to the 'conservationists', actions on World Heritage listing. Australia has a proud history; we were the seventh nation to sign the World Heritage Convention 40 years ago, and yet this week two issues of significance—the Great Barrier Reef and the attempted delisting of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area—are on their agenda. It is shameful action from a person who claims to be a conservationist.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  I was delighted last Saturday to attend the Racecourse Road Winter Lights Festival. It was a day of high activity and fun for the people of Brisbane. I was pleased to join my state and council colleagues the member for Clayfield, the Hon. Tim Nicholls; and Brisbane City Council councillor for Hamilton Ward, Councillor David McLachlan in the opening of the Lantern Festival in the evening. It was the second year that we were treated to an absolutely stunning lantern parade with a circus theme. There were performances happening all along the road to the festival, and it was a truly interactive experience. The day would not have been complete without the presence of some of Brisbane's finest performers, entertainers and musicians. We were treated to some community and jazz performances as well as a live art show.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who were fortunate to attend despite the very inclement weather saw some wonderful cheese on display and for tasting purposes. There were 20 of Australia's finest cheeses there. The day was a huge success with wonderful entertainment for everyone. It was a great family day out and it was so fantastic to see so many creative, talented and innovative people having a great time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  A few weeks ago I had the great privilege of travelling on the Georges River with the Georges River river keeper to see what a truly magnificent waterway this is but also to have a look at the few environmental issues affecting that river. The river is currently in good health. There are a lot of fishermen enjoying good hauls of blackfish, jewfish and bream from the river, and things are generally on the improve, but there are a few issues of concern, and one of those is the number of plastic bottles in the river.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The river keeper tells me that last year he pulled no less than 300,000 plastic bottles from the river, and that is what they are actually able to take out. Who knows how many there are at the bottom of the river and on the riverbanks? In fact, the river keeper took me to one place on the riverbank where there was a collection of plastic bottles and other rubbish and waste. I actually gagged when I was there. I felt physically sick from the amount of rubbish that had accumulated on the side of the river.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the coalition's plans for a green army will actually do practical things for the environment. We already have four programs approved for the Georges River, and the river keeper has applied for another three programs that will allow the coalition to get on to do the practical work that will improve the environment of our local areas. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  There are proposed changes to the way Australia Post will deliver our post—proposals that would cut the post down to three days per week. If one is examining the nature of Australia Post these days, it is not simply a matter of the parcel service being successful and the letter service not being successful. There are 485 executives of Australia Post earning more than a backbench member of parliament—more than $200,000. That is more than three parliamentsful of executives earning more than $200,000. For the average old lady in Manangatang who wants her postage deliveries to continue five or six days a week, cutting Australia Post staff might be better than cutting the post to deliveries a two- or three-day service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great Australian postal workers who deliver our post are also delivering large numbers of small parcels. I am not sure of the legitimacy of the claim that the postal service's letter delivery service is not helpful in delivering large amounts of small parcels that are being organised by eBay these days. I think there is another way of going about Australia Post as an organisation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I inform the House that on the weekend I had the honour of attending the Hastings Cancer Trust's 10th annual charity ball and over $50,000 was raised by the members of the Port Macquarie community. The Hastings Cancer Trust has been operating since 2005 and has raised over $1 million. That has been put 100 per cent into care for cancer sufferers in the Hastings and Macleay valleys. No administration costs have ever been gained; it has all been pro bono or volunteer work. It is one of the many strong community groups in the Hastings Valley. I would like to congratulate the committee, which changed hands, and one lady in particular, Betty Allman, who has worked tirelessly for 10 years for the committee and has now retired from it. Many of the staff at the North Coast Cancer Institute have taken over roles in the committee and they are doing a sterling job. I would like to congratulate all those donors of prizes, raffle sellers and committee organisers who put their heart and soul into the event and will do so for many years. They have delivered home hospice care, liver surgery equipment and such into the integrated cancer care centre. Thank you.</span>

They will go up every six months under this government. This government has absolutely delivered on its commitment not to change pensions in this term of parliament. We have absolutely delivered on our commitment not to change pensions in this term of parliament. It is true that we have not continued with a national partnership agreement on pensioner concessions, but pensioner concessions are overwhelmingly the preserve of the states. Less than 10 per cent of the value of pensioner concessions was provided by the Commonwealth, and, given that in this budget the Commonwealth is providing the states with some $9 billion more, we thought that this was a small price for the states to pay toward the task of budget repair.</span>

I can inform her and other members of the House that the government is making steady progress towards all of its key election goals. This government was elected to scrap the carbon tax, because that will save the households in Australia $550 a year, and legislation is before the Senate. This government was elected to build the infrastructure of the 21st century, because of years of neglect by state Labor governments, and work is soon underway on many of these projects. We were elected to clean up Labor's budget mess, because $1 billion a month in dead money is being wasted just to pay the interest on Labor's budget debt. This budget brings us back close to balance within four years. </span>

In the comparable period under the former government there were almost 200 illegal boats and almost 13,000 illegal arrivals by boat. Operation Sovereign Borders is working. The boats are stopping, and that is saving lives. The boats are stopping, and that is saving the budget $2½ billion.</span>

I also pay tribute to our partner governments in Nauru, PNG, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Indonesia, whose cooporation is also making these successful policies possible. Combating the people smugglers is an ongoing effort, but this government will remain vigilant to ensure that our borders are secure and our country is safe.</span>

Frankly, under Operation Sovereign Borders, that is just another day at the office. It is another day at the office for the men and women who comprise the Operation Sovereign Borders team, whether they are in our Navy, our Customs and Border Protection Service, the Department of Immigration or our Federal Police. All of those agencies are working together to achieve the results we have achieved to date. Together with the Prime Minister, I thank them for their service. This House should also thank them for their service and what they have been able to achieve. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are alternative approaches and there have been other approaches in the past. The previous government engaged in a reckless, conceited and dangerous experiment from 2007 onwards. The purpose of that experiment was to try and prove that John Howard had it wrong on border protection. They abolished every brick in the wall of border protection that John Howard and his government had built up over the term of that government. What was the result? More than 50,000 people turning up on more than 800 boats; almost 1,200 people dying at sea; 15,000 people denied permanent visas under our Refugee and Humanitarian Program; and detention centres being built every other day and then burning down under the same government that built them. It was chaos, it was cost and it was tragic. That was the result of the alternative approaches and the experiment. </span>

The results are that John Howard had it right and this government had it right, because we have not had a successful people-smuggling venture to this country in six months. My advice to those opposite is: get over it. Understand that you got it wrong and it is time to look this way when it comes to border protection policies that work. Get on board with the things that are saving lives and putting the integrity back into our immigration program that was lost on the conga line of failures who now sit on the opposition bench who used to sit on this side. They should look this way for success.</span>

Minister, you have stated that deregulation of higher education will not necessarily lead to higher fees. If regional universities are not in a position to increase fees, I am concerned that this will mean they will not be obliged to offer new Commonwealth scholarships, which are funded from increased fees. Minister, would you please consider pooling the scholarship funds and redistributing to all students on a needs basis?</span>

                  </a>  If the member for McEwen had cared to wait and hear the answer, I was actually talking about theatre students from non-mainstream schooling who have been hurt by trauma and abuse and are finding their way back into higher education through the arts, in the member for Indi's electorate. If he had cared to be a little bit better mannered, he would have heard that that is what I was talking about. But unfortunately I expect very little from the member for McEwen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To answer the member for Indi's question, I know that she cares very deeply about education, as the transformative nature of it can help kids like the ones from Highwater Theatre, but also young people across Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas, lift their qualifications and their opportunity to get better jobs and earn more income. In terms of the deregulation of fees, the tremendous opportunity presented by our reforms is to let universities make their own decisions about what they value the most in their institutions and what they believe they can charge higher fees for and also, in regional and rural areas, how to price their courses in order to compete with the institutions in the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great thing about the Commonwealth scholarships fund is that each university will get the opportunity to make its own decisions about how to attract students through scholarships. So in a rural and regional area—as many of the coalition members who represent rural and regional areas would also be interested to know—they will be able to tailor their scholarships to what they think will most attract students, whether they are from the local area or whether they are from the city, to regional areas. They might decide to forgo tuition fees for those students. They might decide to help them with living expenses in order to move to rural and regional areas. They might decide to pay them relocation expenses. The reason each institution will make its own decisions about fees and how to spend its Commonwealth scholarships, within the guidelines that the Commonwealth will develop through our working groups, is so that they can compete with suburban institutions. I see great opportunities for rural and regional institutions in our reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also point out to the member that there have been some excellent articles written about this by rural and regional vice-chancellors or former vice-chancellors like Jim Barber, from the member for New England's electorate. He was the former Vice-Chancellor at UNE. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> just after the budget, he pointed out the opportunities that deregulation presented to rural and regional areas, and I would recommend it to her.</span>

Like a previous member for Bennelong, he is very concerned about the sustainability of the budget. It is hugely important that we make sure that we live within our means as a government so that the decisions that are made tomorrow are not punitive for those most vulnerable. Our latest legacy of $667 billion of debt and budgets where there are no surpluses means that Australians are currently spending $1 billion a month on interest, with 70 per cent of it going overseas—and it is going to $3 billion. Of course, you have to be straight with the Australian people in dealing with this. You have to be honest with the Australian people in dealing with this, and we are being honest with the Australian people. </span>

                  </a>  Honesty comes as a great surprise to members of the Labor Party because, of course, they did say they were going to have four years of surplus. They continue to delude themselves that in fact the budget is fine; but, in fact, the member for Lilley himself, in a confession to still existing Senator Carr, apparently, said the budget situation is 'ruinous'. So there is a bit of hypocrisy there. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a bit of hypocrisy from the Leader of the Opposition. If you came into this parliament today, you would think he was really concerned about the impacts of decisions on pensioners. But do you know what? It was about two years ago that he sidled up to me—just over there—and he begged me to help him to take 60,000 women off a single parents pension and put them on Newstart. Do you remember that, with the member for Jagajaga over there, because of the divisions in the Labor Party? Remember that: taking 60,000 single-income parents off a single parents pension? He knew about the divisions in the Labor Party. And then there were all these crocodile tears when they went into opposition—crocodile tears for single parents, crocodile tears from Labor, crocodile tears from the Leader of the Opposition. </span>

                  </a>  Oh yes, I got it wrong! He was the architect of it, with the member for Jagajaga. So the hypocrisy of the Labor Party is just a little bit overwhelming. They cry crocodile tears now about the fate of pensioners, yet when they were in government they did not hesitate to take people off a single parents pension and put them onto Newstart. Well, spare us the moment. We are the best friend Australian pensioners have ever had. We are their best friends, because we want the pension to be sustainable. We want it to be affordable. We want the pensioners of Australia to get a fair deal from the government, not just today but tomorrow. We will not cop the hypocrisy of this hypocrite! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As Reserve Bank board member John Edwards—the distinguished economist and friend of the Labor Party that the Labor Party appointed to the Reserve Bank Board—said: 'This is a budget crisis. It does need to be addressed.' It is going to be addressed by us in ways to protect the vulnerable. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:31</span>):  I want to praise the member Durack for being entirely consistent in her determination to get rid of the carbon tax and to get rid of the mining tax. Everyone on this side of the House is entirely consistent. There are no hypocrites over here; there are no people who go around the country and say one thing and then come into this place and do something else. Where would those people be, who go around and say things to the rest of Australia and then come into this place and do something else? There is always someone on the Labor side that bells the cat. We thought it was always going to be, in relation to the mining tax, the member for Perth, who has repeatedly said that the mining tax is just outrageous. Yet, the member for Perth keeps voting in here to keep it. So she is inconsistent. I would not say it is the act of a hypocrite—I would not say that—but I would say it is entirely inconsistent. Of course we can always rely on Senator Mark Bishop, from Western Australia, who said only yesterday, 'For Western Australia the mining tax is seen as coming from Canberra. It is seen as intrusive, it is seen as a cost. Whilst it can be seen as a cost with benefits if government raises significant revenue and spends it on things that government does, if it fails to receive any revenue at all people will simply ask, why are you doing that, what is the value?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to get rid of the mining tax. We want to get rid of the carbon tax. We are entirely consistent with the position that we took to the last election, and we want to get rid of these taxes because that is going to strengthen the Australian economy—it is going to deliver more jobs for everyday Australians and it is going to deliver greater prosperity. So we are entirely consistent. Unfortunately, the Labor Party are not. I seem to recall them saying they were going to terminate the carbon tax, yet they want to keep it. I thought they were embarrassed about the mining tax, as the Leader of the Opposition said to the Minerals Council and to the Business Council of Australia. He said don't worry, the mining tax was going to go—but he is voting to keep the mining tax. The Labor Party cry crocodile tears about pensioners but when they were in government they took the pension off 60,000 single mothers and now we know, in relation to carers, there is that same desperate inconsistency.</span>

Page 126 of Budget Paper No. 2 shows that the cuts to hospitals start on 1 July—in just 12 days time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:38</span>):  I thank the member for Casey for his question. He recognises how important the trucking industry is to the Australian economy and indeed his own local community, where there is substantial agribusiness in the wine industry, berries, apples and flowers, all of which require the trucking industry to bring them to market. So extra costs imposed on the trucking industry add to the costs of producers and of course increase the cost of living for consumers. The trucking industry has welcomed strongly this government's commitment to $50 billion worth of investments mainly in our national road system. They are also very pleased with the commitment for $248 million for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program and $565 million to fix up road black spots. All of these things help build a better road system. But if Labor were still in office the story would be very different today. They would be forcing legislation through the parliament this week to impose the carbon tax on the trucking industry, to add close to 7c a litre to their fuel costs, add to the cost of moving things around the nation, add to the costs of business and add to the costs of consumers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, our government has not increased the road user charge this year—something Labor never did. They raised the road user charge every year on the trucking industry to add to their costs. But this government has not increased the road user charge and that is of enormous benefit to the industry.</span>

                  </a>  For the benefit of members opposite, who I think must have had a bad night at the ball because they are absolutely hysterical today, let me make two points. We are eliminating taxes. We are scrapping the carbon tax, we are scrapping the mining tax, and if members opposite would like us to keep that promise they can pass the legislation. We are reducing the tax burden. The overall tax burden reduces by $5 billion as a result of decisions taken by this government. So I am really pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has reminded people of what I said in 2012, because we have absolutely delivered on those commitments.</span>

The Australian government condemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of the extreme and brutal terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIL's reported massacre of 1,700 Iraqi defence force personnel and attacks on civilians in Iraq are truly horrifying. The loss of life and the mass displacement of people in Iraqi is devastating. While we have not received a request for assistance from the Iraqi government, today I have announced $5 million in humanitarian aid to support the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from the violence. Australia's assistance will be provided through the World Food Programme and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It will provide food, medical assistance, tents, access to clean water and hygiene kits to those displaced by this violence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the deteriorating security situation, the Australian government has reduced staff numbers at our embassy in Baghdad, leaving only a core. We strongly urge Australians in Iraq to consider departing Iraq immediately, while commercial airlines are operating. Those Australians who choose to remain in Iraq should be aware that we have limited capacity to provide consular assistance.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We note the Iraqi government's efforts to counter terrorism and fight back against the forces of extremism. The government is deeply concerned that there are Australian citizens travelling to Syria, and we believe to Iraq, to fight with or support terrorist groups. This is against Australian law and, if they return to Australia, they will face the full force of our law. ISIL is listed as a terrorist organisation under Australian law. Our Criminal Code imposes strict penalties, including up to 25 years imprisonment for Australians involved with terrorist organisations.</span>

                  </a>  from the current sixty-forty arrangements to fifty-fifty, which we think is a fair and reasonable contribution for students to make. I would like to read a letter I received from Graeme Mitchell, a graduate of the University of Western Sydney. It very much encapsulates exactly what the government is trying to achieve through our higher education reforms: 'My father died in my second-last year at high school. I lost all interest in education and bombed out. My then deputy principal told me and several colleagues we were dills and would never amount to much. I had to get a job to help support my family. My dad's death, my deputy principal's expressed opinion of me and the dead-end job I was obliged to take did nothing for my self-worth. I drifted from one dead-end job to another. In my 40s I became aware of HECS and applied for uni entry as a mature-age student, not thinking for a moment that I would make it, but I did. I graduated second in my course, in the top one per cent of all faculties, and won several outstanding-student awards. My academic achievement gave my self-worth an enormous boost. My degree got me a much better job and income, and I had the satisfaction of paying something back to the society that had supported me through uni. My HECS contribution was a pittance compared to my post-degree income.'</span>

He understands the transformative impact of higher education. Rather than whinge, moan and complain about being asked to contribute to his own higher education, he pulled himself up from the bootstraps, got himself the higher education qualifications he needed and massively increased his income and his self-worth.</span>

                </a>  Yes, most grievously. In today's Mackay <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mercury</span> on page 18 John Pratt of Wilmar Sugar Australia has said: 'Mr Christensen and canegrowers need to explain why they don't want canegrowers to be part of a marketing system that would give them more farm income.' He goes on to say: 'Growers would have on average achieved a cane price which was more than $4 per tonne higher than under QSL, Queensland Sugar Ltd, which equates to an increase of more than 50 per cent in average gross margins.' What Mr Pratt has not said is that the premium achieved by Wilmar was done through an aggressive price pool within Queensland Sugar Ltd.</span>

                </a>  Yes, Madam Speaker. Also, Mr Pratt raised another matter. He said, 'We have offered to meet Mr Christensen to explain the details of our proposal, but so far he has chosen not to meet with Wilmar.' I have on three separate occasions met with Wilmar about this issue, most recently on 16 May in Mackay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  We just heard a personal explanation from the member for Dawson. I say to the member for Dawson: it will take more than that to save you in your electorate following the bringing down of this horrendous budget. It will take more than your opposition to that terrible PPL scheme to save you in Dawson. I hope constituents in Dawson are listening to this debate this afternoon because I have no doubt that, at the conclusion of this debate, my colleagues and I will have convinced them and left them in no doubt that this is a bad budget for rural and regional Australia. While there is a lot of competition in measuring which is the biggest broken promise in this budget, I suspect many of them will come to the conclusion that the increased fuel taxes in this budget will go down as the worst broken promise of all. I hope that the constituents of the member for Dawson are listening. I hope that the constituents of the member for Eden-Monaro are listening. I hope the constituents of the members for New England, Page, Capricornia, Braddon, Lyne and Parkes are listening. They are all members who represent rural and regional Australia who I know fear going back to their electorates again this weekend because of their incapacity to sell this terrible budget to their constituents.</span>

I have a quiz for members this afternoon and I invite all members on both sides of the chamber to participate. I have some questions this afternoon. The first is about people who have embarrassed themselves in politics. The second is about political parties which have embarrassed themselves in politics and then I have three questions on mathematics—three maths questions just to keep people alert.</span>

I am going to share a quote with the chamber and then I am going to ask people who this quote is from. I am going to give people hints because, as I said, I know we are all a bit tired on Thursday afternoon. So I am going to give people hints. This is a person who has actually served in this place and, in fact, remains in this place. The person says this of fuel taxes: 'Fuel tax is a tax on distance. If ever there was a country that should not aggressively tax fuel it is a vast country like Australia. It is a tax on doing business outside the capital cities. It is a tax on farming in the distant parts of our nation. It is a tax on living and setting up a business in a country town.'</span>

Would be the Liberal Party for bringing down such an embarrassing budget? It is a pretty hot contest, once again, but no, I think—</span>

                  </a>   The member for Blair has it! It is the National Party! I remind members of the play in the lead-up to this budget, when we were going to lose the diesel fuel rebate. This is the straw man the coalition likes to put up, 'We've got a plan. We've got to put petrol taxes up, despite our election promises. But what are we going to do about the National Party? They won't be happy about it because they know it impacts adversely disproportionately on country Australia. I know! I know what we'll do. We'll feign the revocation of the diesel fuel rebate and they'll get themselves all worked up about that. Then, on election night, we'll say, "No, we're not revoking the diesel fuel rebate," and they'll all breathe a sigh of relief. But they won't work out until the next morning what has happened with petrol taxes!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what went on in this place only a couple of months ago, and the National Party takes the prize for the most embarrassing moment for a party in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We move to mathematics, and I make this point very deliberately because it helps people understand what is happening with fuel taxes in this country, and it helps us to understand what the difference is between excise in petrol now compared to the days prior to the GST.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask members this question: if petrol were at 70c at the bowser and you take 7c off because John Howard, when he was Prime Minister, took 7c off excise—I say '7c' but I think he took 6.7c off, so we will say 7c to keep it easy—so that the GST would not necessarily increase the price of the GST. So if you take 70c and subtract 7c off the excise and then you put 10 per cent on, what do you get? You get roughly the same price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what about when fuel is $1.50 a litre? When you get to $1.50 a litre and you take 7c off you end up with a fuel price of about $1.57 a litre. Even John Howard understood that you cannot put a tax on a tax. He did not anticipate, of course, that oil prices would accelerate and that the 7c reduction would go nowhere near compensating motorists for the GST.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, if John Howard had left the excise indexation in place fuel excise would not be 38c today, it would be 50c. So that tells you what the now Prime Minister's decision is going to do to fuel prices in another 10 years. So this is not just a decision that impacts today, this is a compounding decision—something that is going to increase exponentially petrol prices over a period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Deputy Prime Minister himself has pointed out, this is a decision that falls disproportionately adversely on rural and regional Australia, because we travel longer distances. The Treasurer goes from North Sydney into the city for his meetings, just across the bridge. In rural and regional Australia we drive hundreds of kilometres on a daily basis. Sometimes we drive 100 kilometres just to go to the supermarket. This is not something understood by those who live in our capital cities. And it is about time those members who I mentioned earlier, those who purport to represent their rural and regional electorates, stood up to this mob—stood up to this government and explained how these things fall disproportionately on rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will leave others to go through the many other budget issues that adversely affect us in the bush in particular. They go to the GP tax, changes to the universities and changes for the unemployed who, themselves, have to travel long distances to apply for a job and who have to travel long distances to get to a TAFE course or any sort of a training course—if, indeed, in rural and regional Australia they can get one all. That is another disadvantage faced by those living in the bush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to one very specific broken promise before I close on the budget, because the Minister for Agriculture is with this. I put these questions to him in the parliament last night and he refused to answer them so I am going to give him another chance today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he donned the Akubra back in February and wandered out into drought-affected Australia he got all the newspaper reports he was looking for. He and the Prime Minister were on the 6 o'clock news, and in the lead-up to that drought tour the drought was in the news on a daily basis. We could not turn on our televisions in the morning for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Today</span> show or for <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunrise</span> without them talking about drought. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> in New South Wales was running a drought donation scheme. Everyone was talking about drought. But the moment the Prime Minister and the agriculture minister went out to announce their package it all stopped. It was a beautiful political circuit-breaker for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But guess what? The drought has not ended for those struggling in rural and regional Australia. I was outside Emerald just last week, meeting with some of these people who are very disappointed in this mob on the other side. I ask the minister again: is the $80 million I was referring to still available to assist drought affected farmers? You have taken $40 million out of Labor's scheme. You will not deliver $40 million under your scheme this year because you have not delivered one cent to farming families. I want you, Minister, to guarantee here today that the $80 million—the $40 million you took from the old scheme and the $40 million you will not spend this financial year in the current scheme—will remain available to farmers in the coming financial year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night I went to the Midwinter Ball, and I have to say there was a comedian there who did not really hit the high notes at all. So he went away, dressed up as the Queen and came back, and it was not much better. Today he has come back and dressed up as the member for Hunter, and he's about as bad as he was last night! I will give you a tip: if you are going to be a comedian, you have got to be funny.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he did raise a range of things. The issue today is a less-than-1c excise which was initially introduced by the Labor Party under Hawke. What the Labor Party are proposing—unless you want to tell us this is not the truth—is on 1 July to introduce a 6.85c-a-litre increase in the price of diesel. That is still your position, isn't it?</span>

They have moved a motion about a less-than-1c increase in the price of fuel, yet they stand behind a 6.85c increase on diesel. It just goes to show you how bizarre they are.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we had the representation of the things that are done—like a quiz show. We can have another quiz show. Who were the clowns who came up with an idea on the back of a coaster that they would build themselves a new telephone company which was going to cost us approximately $100 billion at the end? Who was that? Who could that possibly have been? Who could be that bizarre that they would come up with the biggest capital infrastructure project in the life of our nation, bigger than the Snowy Mountains scheme, and do it apparently because Senator Conroy was trying to track down the Prime Minister—your old mate, Mr Rudd—got on the plane, said, 'I just have to talk to him quickly,' and, by the time he got off the plane had stitched Australia up for the biggest capital infrastructure project in our nation's history without a cost-benefit analysis. Do you know how good that game was? I was looking at its books at the Senate estimates. I remember going through it. They spent more on airfares for their staff than they actually earned. So there is something for the quiz. Who put that up?</span>

Who did that? Who could that possibly have been? Was it you? Did you do that? You are looking at me. I think it was you. I think you know who did it. It's the Trappist monk! And yesterday, when we were in the other chamber—I would have left that conversation behind—he wanted to blow it up. He's a violent Trappist monk! If he's not burning it down, he's blowing it up!

Who decided to take a private asset and put it in the hands of the government? That was you. That was your party. Who was the party that divested people in New South Wales of their coal assets back in 1983? Who did that? It was you. Who took the nation to about $330 billion in current debt? When we handed over to you we actually had money in the bank. The world owed us money. By the time you handed back we were around $300 billion in debt. Who did that? You did.</span>

They do. They like it in Brisbane, they like it in Sydney but they just do not like it out in the country. When you are doing an observation of the chamber and looking for people in regional seats, how many have you got, mate?</span>

The trouble is, it might be your policy to terminate the carbon tax, but it is not your colleagues' policy to terminate the carbon tax. They are over in the Senate. You can do something for our nation right now. If you are listening to this over on the other side—they actually do have a telephone on their desk and they can listen to this—I can assure you that the member for Hunter said that it is still their policy to terminate the carbon tax. If you are listening to this, move it now, get rid of it. The member for Hunter is vastly more amusing when he is trying to be serious than he is when he is trying to be amusing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  I am more than happy at some point to have an opportunity to talk about my attitude to the mining tax and why in fact it has not impacted negatively. It may have impacted negatively on the Labor Party, but it has not impacted negatively on the mining industry in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we want to talk about today are all the surprises for rural Western Australia, for all of rural Australia, that were contained in the budget. Mr Abbott promised over and over again that his government would be a government of no surprises. People would know exactly what was going to confront them. But rural Australia had a lot of very nasty surprises. The member for Hunter spoke about the very nasty surprise of the fuel tax indexation. But I want to talk a bit about the financial assistance grants, the FAGs, and how over $900 million in cuts to these grants has disproportionately affected rural Australia and indeed remote rural Australia. If we look at the analysis of the regions that are most affected, we see that the very small rural and remote shires rely on the FAGs for around 36 per cent of their income; small rural and remote shires for 22 per cent; and the others between 20 per cent and 36 per cent. So the small rural shires are the ones that are going to be disproportionately affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just the other day I ran into the shire president of Morawa. She explained that, this year alone, her council is going to have to increase its rates by four per cent just to cover the reduction in the financial assistance grants. There are many more shires that are far more affected. In Halls Creek, Wiluna, Carnarvon, Derby and East Kimberley shires, in the member for Durack's electorate, FAGs represent in excess of 20 per cent of their budget. They will have to hit the residents with an increase. Yilgarn, Leonora and Laverton shires, in the member for O'Connor's electorate, all have a heavy reliance on FAGs. So this is going to have a major impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about the impact this is going to have on the Aboriginal communities across Australia, specifically the health services in the Western Australian Aboriginal communities. From recent hearings of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia, it is becoming very clear that the condition of our Aboriginal communities is a major constraint on development in northern Australia. We are very clear, as report after report has been, that progress cannot be made in northern Australia unless we close the gap. What is happening here? Over $500 million is coming out of Aboriginal services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, the GP co-payment is just going to compound the problem for Aboriginal health services in Beagle Bay, Kalgoorlie, Derby, Broome, Carnarvon, Geraldton, Halls Creek, Fitzroy Crossing and Kununurra. There is absolutely no way that these Aboriginal controlled community health services can charge the co-payment. They bulk-bill the vast majority of their services. If they waive the co-payment they will receive $5 less per visit in government rebates. That cut will directly result in them having to reduce a whole raft of services. So the co-payment alone is creating a great problem. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The member for Perth mentioned the freezing of the financial assistance grants, but she did not mention that the Roads to Recovery program is going to be doubled. For many of the regional shires she is speaking about, the net effect is actually a positive one, not a negative one.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to address the comments made by one half of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Two Ronnies</span>, my neighbour down here from the Hunter. The member for Hunter gives irony a whole new meaning. For those who are new here, we had a boundary change in 2010. There was wailing and screaming and protest from a bit of the Parkes electorate about having to leave Parkes and go into Hunter, but these things happen in a redistribution. A couple of towns from the Parkes electorate went into Hunter, one of those being Kandos, which happens to have a cement plant that had been there for 100 years. Guess what happened on the day after the election? They shut it down, taking 106 jobs and leaving generations of people unemployed. So I went up there. It was not in my electorate, but I thought that, as I had been looking after these people for a term or so, I had better go and see what was going on. The members of the union had come across from Newcastle and were explaining to the workers that losing their jobs was a good thing, because it was for a greater cause. The carbon tax was going to cool the globe and make us look good on the international stage. Kevin Rudd was going to Stockholm and we had to have something to sell, so they had lost their jobs for a greater cause. The member for Hunter did not make his way across there until some time later, and, when he got there, it was like: 'Don't mention the war; don't mention the carbon tax.' A lot of the people of Kandos are now fly-in-fly-out miners in Cobar, North Queensland and Western Australia, because the industry that sustained them—</span>

                  </a>  Ah, my favourite rural Labor person: the member for Richmond—the one who fights so hard for the 17 per cent of her constituents who vote Green, the one who dies in a ditch for those Green votes, for those hardy rural souls from Byron Bay as they toil away over their hydroponics in the back shed. She is such a great advocate for the 17 per cent of people in her electorate who vote Green. But I do not want to be negative. </span>

This government treats rural Australia with respect. This government does not watch a Green-inspired program on the ABC and shut down a cattle trade, decimating not only a whole industry but also a couple of states and territories.</span>

There is real money now in research and development, because we understand that Australian farmers and Australian regional communities have a future. For those of you who may be new, we sat here for two terms with this government and heard ministers such as Burke and others talk about farmers in slow voices, because they needed to help farmers to adapt to climate change. How were they going to do that? 'Oh, we will close down the cattle industry—that'll help.' They sacrificed the aspirations of rural Australia in order to get the vote from the member for Melbourne, up here behind us, because he had such a struggling urban electorate in inner-city Melbourne that they had to pacify him.</span>

We are talking about an NBN network that delivered no services to my electorate in six years—and we still have people who cannot have a telephone. The hypocrisy! I admire the member for Hunter's attempt at humour, because it is better than his attempt at politics. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He and his mate from Corangamite shut down the national rural farmers health service. They shut it down—because they do not support farmers. They do not support people in regional areas. They sit there and they say they do all these things and they get the clown prince 'Jar Jar Binks' Joyce over there to come in and rant and rave, but he could not talk about the budget. The reason he could not talk about the budget is that this petrol tax, which the government increased, despite saying that they would not increase taxes, is hurting rural and regional Australians.</span>

                  </a>  No, he said 'week'. Please listen to your own minister—I know it is hard and it is painful and it is shrill, but try and listen to him. Every week the average person in rural and regional areas uses at least 100 litres of fuel. They will now pay extra tax on that fuel—a tax that lot said before the election they would not have—and an increase in the GST on that tax—a tax on a tax that is built on a lie that is built on a lie. It is unfair. Because we do not have shops on every corner, hospitals in every town and access to schools and public transport, which we know this government is afraid of, the impacts are greater.</span>

The member for Wannon would certainly know this minister who was dragged out of her slumber and said that this tax is unfair and unbelievable. Your former employer Fran Bailey, a Liberal minister in the Howard government, said how disproportionately this affects country areas. It affects country areas because they need cars to travel. Most people travel 30 or 40 kilometres to school and have to travel 60 to 70 kilometres to get jobs in regional areas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government before the election said that they would be a government th no surprises and no excuses and that there would be no increases in taxes, but they did every single one of those things. The foreign minister, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, said: 'It's wrong to say we are talking about increasing fuel excise. We're not doing that.' But in actual fact they did. When the Prime Minister was asked before the election whether the conditions of the budget would be an excuse for breaking promises, he said: 'Exactly right. We'll keep the commitments that we make. All the commitments we make will be carefully costed.' We found out through <span style="font-style:italic;">The Weekly Times</span> this week that the government has not done an impact statement on the impact of this fuel tax on rural and regional Australia.</span>

                  </a>  He is sensitive about that. He is also sensitive about the fact that he has been asked by his leadership group to raise this matter of public importance. He needed a lot of face to put forward the arguments he did today. We have already heard from the member for New England the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in terms of raising the fact that rural and regional Australia would not have a better friend than the coalition government. The fact is we are fixing the budget mess that these guys created over the last six years. We left them with a budget surplus and we left them with net debt of $40 billion and they ended their six years with $123 billion in future forward deficits and then left us approaching in 10 years a $667 billion debt. That is what we faced when we came into government. Now we have to fix that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is a rural and regional electorate. It is very dependent on small business. In the course of the last six years some 519,000 jobs in small business were lost. In a rural and regional electorate, after you consider government jobs in teaching, in the provision of police services and in hospitals for example, small business is the largest employer. If we cannot put in place policies that support small business, we are dooming rural and regional Australia to a dreadful existence. That is what happened over the last six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Eurobodalla Shire, one of the major shires in my electorate, the unemployment rate is over seven per cent. That is what we inherited. We have to fix that problem, so we are repairing the budget. That was one of the key policies that we put to the Australian population at the election and it is one of the key reasons we were actually elected in a landslide in the 2013 election. This budget, however, is not just about contributing; it is also about building Australia. The budget contains the biggest infrastructure project in the history of Australia. We have put forward a policy that includes $50 billion of expenditure on roads and other infrastructure and my electorate of Eden-Monaro is getting a down payment on that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only last Friday the then Acting Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, visited Queanbeyan in my electorate and announced a $50 million road project for the Queanbeyan bypass. This is a vital piece of infrastructure. It is not just about road safety in the Queanbeyan district; it is about an economic development project that the Queanbeyan City Council has regarded as its top priority for years now, which was denied by the former member for Eden-Monaro, whom I defeated in the election. He would not support that road project. I think it is actually one of the reasons that he lost the electorate in the election. A matter of weeks after the federal budget was released, we were able to announce that we would put forward $50 million: $25 million from the New South Wales government and $25 million from the Commonwealth government. We were also able to announce a number of black spot programs worth some $622,000 in the Eurobodalla shire, in the Bega Valley shire and also in Queanbeyan. These are the down payments for the changes that we announced in the budget. It is a fact that the coalition is looking after Eden-Monaro, and I am very proud of this budget. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms CHESTERS:</span>
                  </a>  I withdraw that comment. But I will say that it will be very hard for the coalition to maintain and hold the seat of Eden-Monaro going forward because this government's budget is hurting rural and regional Australians. This new petrol tax and this unfair budget is hurting rural Australians, not just people in the area of Eden-Monaro but also people in regional Victoria, including in my own electorate of Bendigo. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fuel tax increase is another hit on regional Australians. This tax, which was frozen by the then Prime Minister, John Howard, in 2001, is now going to go up twice a year every single year. How did this come about? The Nationals were claiming a great big victory in the lead-up to the budget: 'Don't worry, bush. We've got it under control. There'll be no touches to the diesel excise—no touches.' What they did not see coming around the corner was an increase in the petrol tax—and, if they had, then maybe they would have had a voice on it, because this tax hurts the bush. Petrol going up hurts the bush. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the government have not acknowledged and probably one of the reasons why they have not done their research on this particular area is that petrol prices are even higher in the bush. The further you go out from the city the more petrol goes up. Even in an electorate like Bendigo, you can find on one particular Saturday four or five different petrol prices, depending on where you are. In Bendigo, one day in Woodend it is $1.65 and, on the very same day, it is a $1.50 up the road. Already people who are further out are paying more, and what this tax does is compound that and they will pay even more. The fact is that people living in the country have further to go. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You just have to compare some of the electorates around the country to really understand why the city based Liberals in this government do not understand what is going on in the bush and why they did not think it would be a problem. In my own electorate, it is 136 kilometres from Elmore to Macedon. Let's take the member for Wannon's electorate: it is 251 kilometres from Warrnambool to Dunolly. In the member for Mallee's electorate, it is 380 kilometres from Mildura to Halls Gap. These are big distances that people have to drive. Let's compare that to the Prime Minister's electorate, which is only 12 kilometres wide; compare it to the Treasurer's electorate, which is 10 kilometres wide. When you live in the city, you do not have far to drive; but when you live in the country, you do. So every increase in the petrol tax increases the price of petrol that people in the country have to pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This tax is compounded by other measures in this budget. As we have heard, local councils have been hit hard by their grants being frozen. In my own electorate, the councils have added up that it is about $1.8 million collectively over the life of this government. In health, we have seen massive funding cuts in regional communities that may force some of our regional hospitals to close or to amalgamate. In Bendigo, it is a cut of $25.8 million over the next five years to its hospital. When you look at schools, universities and other higher education institutions, there are, again, big funding cuts. This will hit regional universities really hard. Students may not enrol. For students who have to travel mostly by car, because we do not have decent public transport, there will be extra costs. This government has cut funding to volunteer organisations. Volunteers say that one of the biggest costs associated with the work that they do is the travel—driving in their own cars. Regional communities are held up and kept strong by the work of their volunteers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What compounds the pain of the other cuts in this budget is the fact that the fuel tax is going up. So there is less money in a school budget and then they have to pay more for their petrol. There is less money in the hospitals and then they have to pay more for their petrol. That is the problem with this government: their budget is hurting regional and rural Australia and this petrol tax— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  I am pleased to be speaking on this MPI, which is about the government hurting rural and regional Australia with its new petrol tax and unfair budget. I will actually be referring to that in my speech today. In regional areas it is the National Party that is driving this cruel and unfair budget, particularly through the petrol tax. In my area, on the North Coast of New South Wales, we call this the National Party petrol tax. It will be one of the many legacies of the National Party for a very long time to come in rural and regional Australia. Every time people fill up, they will be saying thanks to the Nats for the petrol tax. This tax will go up twice a year in line with inflation from August this year. This tax increase is a broken promise, and indeed the whole budget was a budget of broken promises. These broken promises will hurt pensioners, families and seniors, with all this array of cruel cuts and unfair increases in the cost of living. The people of regional and rural Australia have every right to feel totally betrayed by this budget of twisted priorities and many broken promises. There are so many of them, including the $80 billion cuts to hospitals and schools, the unfair doctor tax, pension cuts, education cuts, deregulation of university fees and cuts to council assistance grants as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I held a rally in my electorate last week in response to the Abbott government's cruel and unfair budget, and I want to thank those hundreds of people who attended my 'fighting for a fair go' rally last Thursday at the Tweed Heads Civic Centre. In particular, I thank those who travelled a very long distance to make their voices heard. The rally was arranged in response to the overwhelming community concern about this unfair budget and in response to the budget of broken promises. Before the election the Prime Minister and all of his candidates—in my area they were all National Party candidates—were running around saying there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions, and no new taxes. All of those National Party candidates on the North Coast were saying there would be no new taxes but the fact is they were not telling the truth. This budget contained all of those things—all of those things they promised would not happen. Many of these issues were raised at the rally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I especially thank our guest speakers who came along. We had Walt Secord, an MLC from the New South Wales parliament and shadow minister for the North Coast and shadow minister for roads, and also Ron Goodman, Labor's candidate for Tweed in the state election. Both spoke about the unfairness of the budget. The rally heard an array of concerns that locals had. The petrol tax was one of the major issues brought up, because it is particularly unfair for those people in regional and rural areas who do have to travel so much further. The doctor tax also came up, because that will really impact on people in regional areas. Reference was also made to cuts to pensions, family payments and education. Some state issues came up as well, one of the major concerns being the increase in people's power prices that will occur due to the New South Wales Nationals' plan to sell off the poles and wires. That was a big concern—the National Party selling off those poles and wires will push up the price of electricity for people in regional New South Wales. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People brought many signs to the rally, saying nobody voted for the petrol tax, nobody voted for extreme university fees, nobody voted for a doctor tax and nobody voted for pension cuts. The fact is that both the federal government and the New South Wales state government are out of touch with the concerns of people struggling week to week. One of the sentiments raised at the rally was that surely Australia is a better place than this; surely we are a fairer place than we see in this government's cruel and nasty and unfair budget. At the conclusion of the rally there was a resolution passed. The rally resolved that I raise in parliament the fact that the people of the North Coast reject the Liberal-National Party's unfair budget and acknowledge the fact that this budget is harmful to families, seniors and young people. The people of the North Coast condemn this unfair budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about National Party betrayals, the petrol tax is surely up there as one of the biggest betrayals. Another big betrayal is in relation to the Pacific Highway. I would like to point out that in this budget there was no new money at all for funding of the Pacific Highway compared to when we were in government— $7.9 billion in funding for the Pacific Highway and not one cent from them. I was very proud in my electorate to have delivered the federal funding for both the Sexton Hill upgrade and the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale Pacific Highway upgrade. There was $350 million in funding for the Sexton Hill upgrade. It has been open a couple of years now and it is fantastic. Also there was $550 million in federal funding for the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale upgrade which is going to be finished very soon—all that money delivered by the federal Labor government, nothing from the other side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we see the Nationals cutting services, slashing infrastructure funding and increasing taxes. At both the state and federal level the National Party are 100 per cent behind the cruel and unfair budget cuts. They are responsible for the doctor tax, they are responsible for the petrol tax, they are responsible for cutting family payments and pensions. Each member of the National Party should be deeply ashamed. They are cutting pensions of the people who have built our nation, our seniors. They are bringing in a petrol tax. They should be deeply ashamed. It is the National Party that betray the people of regional and rural Australia, and people will remember that for years to come. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on this MPI on the impact of the budget on regional people and particularly people in my electorate. I will get onto the impact of the budget but first I want to dwell on the impact the previous government had on my electorate. The first and most devastating decision that comes to mind was the suspension of the live export trade. You have to have lived in a regional area that produces livestock to understand the impact that this had on our communities. We saw live export prices for shipping wethers fall from $120 to $35. For farmers in my electorate a 1c increase in the fuel excise pales into insignificance compared to the loss of income they suffered from that one decision. It has taken four years to recover and I applaud the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture, who has instilled confidence back into the live export industry. Just recently at the Katanning saleyards we saw shipping wether prices reach $110 a tonne again for the first time since early 2012. I want to applaud the Minister for Agriculture for his efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then they introduced a carbon tax and families across my electorate suffered the increase in living costs that people in metropolitan areas suffered. But it wasn't just that. The WA government copped a $50 million bill, which also impacted on the services people in regional areas receive. The mining industry, which is currently going through downturn in my electorate, copped the loss of the 7c rebate on diesel used off-road. That included diesel used in generator sets and picked up people on stations, picked up people who own roadhouses on the Nullarbor—all extra costs for people in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of my electorate want roads. That is what they need and that is what they are going to get from this government. I do not need to be lectured by the member for Bendigo about distances. I drive 650 kilometres from my home to my office in Kalgoorlie, I drive 480 kilometres from my home to my office in Esperance and I drive 180 kilometres from my home to my office in Albany. I have to tell you that the roads are well below standard. They are unsafe and the people of my community want new roads, they want upgraded roads, and this government is going to deliver a $50 billion infrastructure package which will build the roads of the 21st century. As part of that we will see an additional $320 million injected into Roads to Recovery, taking that program to over $2.1 billion over the forward estimates. This program is funding directly to local government authorities so that they can fix up the roads that they prioritise in their own areas. We have also just announced today an extra $520 million over the next three years for the road black spot program, once again a great investment by the government in saving people's lives in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish today by talking about the diesel fuel rebate. People in my electorate very much dislike the diesel excise rebate being referred to as a subsidy. When the diesel fuel excise was introduced in 1957 it was introduced for road maintenance and building. It was deemed at the time that those people who did not use the roads—farmers, miners, fishermen and other off-road industries—would be exempt from paying that levy. That levy is critical to the economic wellbeing of my electorate and I am prepared to defend that levy. I am very pleased to say that this government also is committed to retaining the diesel fuel levy. </span>

In fact, what actually occurred is that in an article published on the ABC website on 28 March 2013 I stated that I had been involved in surf lifesaving for about 28 years, and I worked with Sydney's and Australia's multicultural communities and was fortunate to work with a number of people from a Pacific Island background and they are very warm and generous people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I rise to speak on the bills before the House and indicate to the House that the bills are designed to establish the Trade Support Loans program for Australian premises. The loans will be concessional and income contingent, with a lifetime limit of $20,000 indexed from 2017. The loans are repayable when the individual's income reaches the Higher Education Loan Program, known as HELP, repayment thresholds. The bill also provides for a 20 per cent discount to be applied to the loan incurred when an Australian apprentice has successfully completed their apprenticeship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to implement an election commitment the current government made in the campaign period. It should be noted that this was the only statement and commitment made on skills at the time of the election by the then opposition. Unfortunately for apprentices what the Prime Minister did not tell them before the election was that the trade support loans would come at a cost. What the Prime Minister failed to tell apprentices was that he would axe the Tools for Your Trade program, taking $1 billion from the pockets of apprentices. This has massive implications for apprentices. Under Tools for Your Trade apprentices were provided $5,500 over the course of their apprenticeship to help with their costs. Apprentices face many significant costs, including items such as tools, uniforms, safety equipment and also travel and day-to-day expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I indicate that I will be moving an amendment to the bill at the conclusion of my contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleagues and I have been contacted by many apprentices who are angry and very upset that they have been deceived. Prior to the election, in their 'real solutions' 2013 election booklet, the Prime Minister told them that the coalition 'will provide better support for Australia's apprentices'. What he has actually done is axe the $5,500 that Labor provided to our apprentices to help them with the cost of their tools or for their training and so forth. He has replaced that payment with a debt. Apprentice electricians can no longer buy expensive voltage testing equipment and other safety equipment without taking out a loan. Apprentice chefs can no longer buy the expensive knives and other equipment they would need without taking out a loan. Apprentice plumbers can no longer buy their expensive toolkit and safety equipment without taking out a loan. Apprentice hairdressers can no longer buy their scissors, hairdryers, straighteners and curlers without taking out a loan. Apprentice mechanics cannot buy their toolkits without taking out a loan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was the minister's answer to this? His answer was to tell apprentices that it did not matter, because they were spending their Tools for Your Trade money on 'tattoos and mag wheels'. We have seen no evidence of this. It is a pity the minister chose to take cheap shots at apprentices. It just demonstrates how out of touch the minister is with the situation facing apprentices. After bagging the apprentices about spending these funds on tattoos and mag wheels the minister introduced the Trade Support Loans Bill and it has absolutely no restrictions on what they can spend their loans on. The minister is more concerned with taking these cheap—and I have to say unsubstantiated—shots at both us and apprentices rather than providing the support that is necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apprentices now will have no choice except to sign up for the loan, even school-based apprentices who are under 18 years of age. Because the government has left no other financial support in place, and therefore has left no other option for apprentices, Labor will not oppose the Trade Support Loans Bill, but we will move a second reading amendment. I will move at the conclusion of my contribution that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that the government has failed to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) advise apprentices that they would be abolishing the Tools for Your Trade program, thus leaving Trade Support Loans as the only form of assistance for the purchase of tools;</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2) adequately explain in clear language the interest rates and full liability of these loans;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(6) offer apprentices the option of lump sum payments in order to purchase expensive items.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first point of our amendment goes to the dishonesty of the government in the lead-up to the election. The Prime Minister did not tell apprentices that he would be axing the Tools for Your Trade program. He did not tell them that he would be leaving them no other option but a debt. In his election statement he said, 'The coalition will provide better support for Australia's apprentices.' I would submit to the House that apprentices will be perfectly legitimately within their reason to have assumed from that they would be getting these loans as an addition, as another option available to them, to support them during their apprenticeship, and not that the better support was based on taking away a major payment that they relied on. He did not say, 'We will give you a loan, but we will take away $5,500.' This is really a mean and tricky approach to election campaigning on this issue, and it is why apprentices are angry about it, as are many employers of apprentices who have contacted us to express their anger about this decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point of our amendment goes to the importance of clear and simple information on how the loans will operate. The minister, despite repeated requests in media releases, in question time and in Senate estimates, has still failed to explain in clear language exactly how these loans will work. In the budget papers it says that apprentices will be charged a 'concessional interest rate', and the minister has been saying the loans are 'interest free' and that they are 'indexed by the CPI'. The minister is refusing to give clear and concise advice to apprentices. Firstly, the minister has accused them of not being responsible with their money, and then he refuses to give them clear details of their liability under this program. I am sure that many in the House would agree that, when extending a loan option to young people, it is very important that the information that they will be using to make their decision on needs to be clear and full and give them an accurate picture of what they are signing up for. It was also disclosed in Senate estimates that the minister had a plan to explore the outsourcing of these trade support loan debts. What this means for any apprentice is completely unclear and the question remains what exactly the minister is considering in doing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third part of the amendment addresses the protection of school based apprentices—children under the age of 18. Indeed, some could be as young as 15 signing up for a school based apprenticeship. The minister has failed to explain whether children will require a parent or guardian to supervise the application and undertaking of these loans and who will be explaining the terms and conditions and ensuring school based apprentices know that they will be entering into a large debt arrangement. In Senate estimates the government admitted that it only has the 'gist of legal advice' about whether a parent will be responsible, for example, for a 16-year-old's $20,000 trade support loan. The minister needs to clarify this and ensure that parents and children are fully informed about their liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACTU in their submission to the Senate bill inquiry also outlined their concerns on this issue. Their submission states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, one concern is that young apprentices starting out could find themselves under pressure to access these loans in order to pay for costs of the apprenticeship that should be borne by their employers, or to forego wage increases because a loan is available to meet their costs. The potential for abuse and misuse of the scheme is real but there is no indication of what resources, if any, will be directed towards educating and supporting apprentices in such situations, given that existing support programs have been abolished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That, of course, refers to the fact that there was a program in place, the apprentice mentoring program, which allowed tradespeople with experience in the field to act as a mentor and adviser to the young apprentice. It could have been, for example, envisaged by the government that that role could be utilised to provide clear and independent advice and support to young people in these circumstances. But they will not be there anymore because the scheme was abolished in the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth part of the amendment is about apprentices who signed up and made their plans to be an apprentice under the existing Tools for Your Trade program. Many apprentices have made financial commitments based on the anticipation of continuing to receive these moneys. Without warning and without any grandfathering arrangements, the goalposts have been completely moved by a mean and tricky decision of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth part of the amendment is about privacy. The explanatory memorandum notes that 'a large amount of personal information will likely be acquired' through the operation of the Trade Support Loan program. The ACTU again raised some valid concerns about the collection of personal information and privacy provisions—and I quote again:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under clause 75 of the Bill, a person only has to take an oath or affirmation to protect information they receive from apprentices. There do not appear to be any repercussions for a breach of these provisions or for failing to adhere to an oath or affirmation. By contrast, under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 the person/officer dealing with personal information has more onerous obligations to meet and the penalty is two years’ jail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question remains with the proposed passage of these bills whether the minister will be putting any measures in place to ensure that an apprentice's personal information is appropriately protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last part of the amendment regards the fact that it has now become apparent that the instalments of this money are going to be paid monthly in arrears. By paying apprentices monthly this will effectively be a wage supplement and will mean that apprentices will have difficulty in purchasing expensive items, such as tools, vehicles, uniforms and fees, without potentially borrowing the money commercially and repaying the loan with their monthly in arrears payments—in effect, repaying a loan with a loan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions to the Senate Economics Committee inquiry on the bill by both the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Contractors of New South Wales and Sarino Russo Apprentices welcomed the loans on the basis that apprentices would have the advantage of an income contingent loan rather than a commercial loan to buy something like a car or ute. The problem is the payment method envisaged in the actual bill would not make this possible. Apprentices should be given the opportunity to take their loans as a monthly payment or as a lump sum each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this, as I have indicated, was not the only attack on apprentices. In addition to axing the Tools for Your Trade program, the minister has also axed the Australian Apprenticeship Access program—a program that provided a sort of pre-vocational entry to apprenticeships for the most disadvantaged to give them an opportunity to get an apprenticeship. They also axed the Australian apprentices mentoring program, which I have mentioned, and the Apprentice to Business Owner program, which gave some small business training to apprentices post completion of their trade to enable them to go out and operate their own small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while the government is telling our young people to earn or learn, it is in fact taking away the very support, particularly with apprenticeships, which is one of the most successful training methods we have for young people to be able to actually achieve that. If the intention of this policy is to improve retention and completion rates for apprentices, it is inexplicable that the government would at the same time be abolishing programs specifically designed to properly recruit and prepare apprentices and to offer them and their employers the advantages of a mentoring program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This view of support for schools and training is unsurprising, given the actions that have been taken by conservative state governments, who in fact have been slashing TAFE—for example, closing campuses, cutting courses, sacking staff and increasing fees. I was however pleased to see today in New South Wales the opposition leader, John Robertson, and the shadow minister for education and training, Ryan Park, announce Labor policies to protect TAFE and to make TAFE courses more affordable and announcing that they are looking to introduce legislation immediately to block fee increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated, I would like to formally move the amendment in the terms given and circulated. I indicate to the House that we will not be opposing the bills, but I ask the government to very seriously consider the amendment that the opposition is putting forward to make the scheme work effectively and fairly for apprentices, those whom this legislation is intended to target. I move:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I was intending to address something very different here today, but I have been so appalled and shocked by the Prime Minister's conduct today in question time that I just want to get on the record what could only be described as a massive misleading of this parliament. If we do not hear from the Prime Minister correcting the record then I hope that we will look further and go forward with a censure motion, because what the Prime Minister has done today is I think a complete betrayal of the obligations of that office.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People will be aware that today we were talking about the cut to the pensioner concessions. I think it is around $1.3 billion over the forward estimates that has been cut from the pensioner concessions. And the Prime Minister was trying to tell us, 'Well, it's not going to be a problem at all'—that this is a responsibility of the states. He goes on and says, 'I am pleased to say that, so far, every single state has undertaken to continue to maintain the value of pensioner concessions.' But perhaps I could just quote from the Western Australian parliament two days ago, when the Hon. Colin Barnett, the Premier, had this to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The commonwealth has decided—it is its decision—to cut its share of the funding; therefore, $25 million has gone. The Western Australian government will not replace that; that is a federal government decision.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He makes this absolutely clear, beyond doubt. On several occasions the Premier of Western Australia has said this very publicly—it has been very well publicised in Western Australia—and now we have the Prime Minister telling us and telling the pensioners of Western Australia and indeed telling the pensioners around Australia that they need not worry because the state governments have all agreed to step into the breach. It is very hard to see that this is anything other than a deliberate misleading of our parliament. And I hope we can get the Prime Minister to come back in here and correct the record, because this is very, very much a misleading of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in a number of other states, like New South Wales, their agreement to fill the breach has of course been for only one year. But at least that can just fall within the basic—</span>

                  </a>  Yes, and it can conform with the basic spin we hear from the government about this budget. But what has happened here to the pensioners of Western Australia, who tomorrow morning will be rallying against this budget and the very, very unfair way it impacts upon pensioners and retirees, will be grist to their mill: to learn that the Prime Minister has come into this place and said that every single state has agreed to maintain the value of pensioner concessions when he must know—it is inconceivable that he does not know—that the Premier of Western Australia has made it very, very clear that that $20 million is gone, dead and buried, and he has no intention of replacing that. So, who is going to cop the cut? Who is going to cop the reduction in their concessions? It is the pensioners of Western Australia. This is most unfair, and I call upon the Prime Minister to come in here and be honest and correct the record.</span>

While other Anglican Church leaders privately support gay clergy, few are prepared to stand up for their beliefs in the face of attacks from those determined to uphold the traditionalist viewpoint. </span>

These included not just his acceptance of gay people, but his work with the disadvantaged and marginalised, with Aboriginal people and his support for the full ministry of women in the church. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">After ordination, John served in several Melbourne parishes and lectured in theological subjects at Ridley College before moving to Sydney in 1990 to take up the role that defined his ministry. John was Rector of St Saviour's Church, Redfern - a parish with a tiny congregation that no one else wanted - for 15 years. He quickly became a highly respected and loved leader in a diverse community marked by disadvantage and need. </span>

It is vintage McIntyre—a clarion call to the church to "be present in community with an integrity of being that assures all those whose lives we touch that we are there alone for their wellbeing; that we are constantly and consistently committed to peace with justice, mercy and inclusion".</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  Prime Minister Abbott recently described himself as a conservationist. This absurd claim would be hilarious if the damage the Abbott government is inflicting on the environment were not so serious. Callous disregard for the environment extends to all corners of this destructive government, and the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, is no exception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Environmental Defenders Offices, EDOs, are community legal centres which operate in each state and territory. They are small, highly dedicated organisations which work to protect the environment through law. They provide the community with legal advice and representation in public interest environmental matters. They work towards the improvement of our environmental laws and regulations. They are in a real sense the environment's own legal team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hardworking EDO lawyers, who forgo the remuneration available in private practice to work in the public interest, fulfil the highest ideals of the legal profession. I have had the privilege to meet with staff from most of Australia's EDOs during my time as Attorney-General and shadow Attorney-General. Regrettably, Senator Brandis has not seen fit to do the same. Senator Brandis went so far as to question in estimates earlier this year whether some of the invaluable work the EDOs perform is 'worthy'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After Senator Brandis's conservative colleagues in the Queensland and New South Wales state governments slashed funding to EDOs, the former Commonwealth Labor government stepped in. As Attorney-General, I delivered $10 million of funding to the EDOs to make sure they could continue their work. This was the largest increase in funding ever received by these organisations. I wanted EDOs to be able to continue to protect endangered species, prevent pollution, assist farmers with land-use issues and support proper urban planning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On taking government, however, Senator Brandis moved quickly to unravel the Labor government's good work. In December he advised all EDOs that they would not be receiving the additional $2.5 million each year that was already committed and contracted for by the Labor government. In his trademark style, Senator Brandis did not actually consult with the organisations he was attacking, although he admitted in estimates that he had been in contact with the Minerals Council of Australia on the issue of EDO funding. This government like to talk about how brave they are and how they courageously take tough decisions, but they never have the guts or even the common courtesy to front up to those their policies hurt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis ripped away the $10 million of total funding already committed to EDOs citing a 'change in policy'. Good governments think before they act, but Senator Brandis has admitted that his government conducted no assessment of the economic or social benefits of funding EDO services. This is a strange way for a supposedly grown-up government to go about making policy. Senator Brandis claims that his funding cut 'fulfils an election promise', but he certainly did not own up to planning an attack on environmental protection services before Australia went to the polls in September last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The EDOs are lean, resourceful and hardy organisations. They are used to setbacks and they will not give up easily. I know that they are working hard to find alternate funding, and I wish them well in this endeavour. I hope that the wider community will band together to support their important work. If we had a government which recognised the value of community legal services, which cared for the environment and which was not afraid of non-government organisations which speak out in the public interest, the EDOs would not be in this position. If we had an Attorney-General who did his duty and spoke up in cabinet for the worth of community lawyers, the EDOs would be able to spend their time protecting this country's environment rather than fundraising.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  On Friday 30 May I welcomed the Assistant Minister for Employment, the Hon. Luke Hartsuyker MP, to Dobell to officially launch the government's new Work for the Dole program. Dobell is one of 18 priority employment areas to implement phase 1 of this program. This means that 18- to 30-year-olds who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and receiving Newstart and/or youth allowance will now be required to participate in Work for the Dole, as opposed to the previous government's non-compulsory program. The former Labor government ran down Work for the Dole, introducing voluntary participation arrangements and removing the incentive for job seekers to participate and acquire new skills and self-confidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government strongly believes that all Australians capable of working should be earning, learning or participating in Work for the Dole. Work for the Dole is an important part of this government's plan to assist young people gain the skills and experience they need to move from welfare to work. Importantly, Work for the Dole keeps young people engaged and active and allows them to make a positive contribution to their local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commencing on 1 July, Work for the Dole participants will complete approximately 15 hours per week for six months in a work-like environment. Minister Hartsuyker and I formally launched Work for the Dole at the Central Coast Wetlands Pioneer Dairy at Tuggerah. The Central Coast Wetlands has benefited through a Work for the Dole project administered by Break Thru People Solutions. Minister Hartsuyker described the Central Coast Wetlands as:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… a great local community project, driven by great volunteers, with the support of a Work for the Dole team, …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Work for the Dole participants have undertaken various projects at the Central Coast Wetlands. As a community project run by volunteers this work is invaluable to the Dobell community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our visit offered the opportunity to meet with current and past Work for the Dole participants, as well as gaining a valuable insight into the benefits of the program. Daniel Mitchell joined the Work for the Dole project at the start of this year and through his involvement has now secured a job at the Central Coast Wetlands. Daniel explained that Work for the Dole had helped him 'to develop the work ethic and necessary skills that were needed to gain employment'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard the fantastic story of John Olarenshaw who, after finding himself unemployed for six months, made the decision to participate in Work for the Dole. John's decision definitely paid off: John now operates his own small business and credits Work for the Dole for his success, saying, 'The program helped me get back into the workforce and gain the confidence to find full-time work.' These are just two of the many examples that clearly demonstrate the benefits of Work for the Dole.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Service providers such as Break Thru People Solutions have provided the opportunity for job seekers to gain the confidence and skills that are required for employment. Currently, Break Thru People Solutions have 85 participants on various Work for the Dole projects. Ross Lewis, the Chief Executive Officer of Break Thru People Solutions, hailed Work for the Dole as a program that provides, 'Employability skills, positive self-esteem, establishment of work routine, team work, specific job skills, socialisation skills and normalisation of work based behaviours.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcomed the minister's decision to launch Work for the Dole in Dobell, because we are a community that will benefit greatly under the new arrangements. Since my election as the member for Dobell, I have strongly advocated the need for the re-introduction of a real Work for the Dole program. Dobell is ranked ninth in New South Wales when it comes to recipients of youth allowance (other) and our full-time unemployment rate for young people, alarmingly, exceeds the national average. The Labour Force Survey of December 2013 found that on the Central Coast 28 per cent of people aged between 15 and 19 years who are looking for full-time work cannot find a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As evidenced by those present at our launch, this government understands that Work for the Dole delivers the skills and confidence that young people need to assist them obtain long-term, sustainable employment. The changes to Work for the Dole introduced by this government will see approximately 2,000 young people in Dobell qualify for this program and hence acquire the skills and experience needed to move from welfare to work and to contribute to our community. This is a great outcome, not only for our young job seekers but also for the broader community and organisations such as the Central Coast Wetlands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank Minister Hartsuyker for taking the time to visit Dobell and launch Work for the Dole. My thanks go also to Break Thru People Solutions and the Central Coast Wetlands for their hard work and commitment to providing local employment opportunities. I am proud to be part of a government that is committed to ensuring that there are positive outcomes for our youth. I look forward to sharing with this parliament Work for the Dole success stories and the ongoing benefits this program will bring to my local community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="PK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RANDALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  Today I wish to raise the issue of superannuation payments to backpackers—generally younger people in Australia on working holiday visas. This is an issue that fruit growers in my electorate of Canning have brought to my attention from time to time and was in fact again raised with me earlier this month. However, it affects other industries where international backpackers commonly work: the hospitality industry would be greatly affected, with many backpackers working in bars, pubs, clubs, restaurants, hotels, at events, for caterers and also for a variety of small businesses and the construction industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crux of the issue is that employers have to pay non-resident backpackers superannuation, and they rightly see this as a waste. The reason small businesses have this view is that non-resident backpackers can fill out a form when they leave the country to have their superannuation monies paid to them immediately, so it is not even providing savings for their retirement, as is the intention of superannuation payments. It is roughly estimated that something like half a billion dollars annually flies out of the Australia because of this measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local growers—and I expect other affected industries—would like to see this requirement to pay non-resident backpackers superannuation taken away completely. However, we do have to continue to ensure foreign workers are not paid any less than Australian workers to maintain the integrity of our migration programs. Perhaps there is a possible avenue where a loading in-lieu of superannuation contributions could be made. This would see an increased wage payment being made up-front and while that person is still residing in Australia. They would hopefully spend the money here, as opposed to it being leaked from our country's economy. However, based on feedback from local fruit growers, who have a lot of firsthand experience with non-resident backpackers, they do not often spend a great deal of money while in Australia. They live simply, with little outgoing costs on items such as food and accommodation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local employers in my electorate, including Karragullen Cool Stores, the Blue Moon Orchard and Casuarina Valley Orchard, have said that many non-resident backpackers take a break at the end of their working holiday in Australia and head off to places like Bali, and then spend the money they have made in Australia over in places like that. These local businesses have said the situation of paying backpackers superannuation is adversely affecting their own profitability. They are competing against other countries like Chile, South Africa and even New Zealand. Those countries do not pay outgoings like superannuation on backpackers' wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just about the superannuation payments that employers are having to make but also about payroll tax and other outgoings. These employers are not against employing or paying backpackers—many would see them as very helpful to their businesses. They just think that if the money were spent or used in Australia then that would be far better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another option could be to pay a loading in-lieu of superannuation towards a registered training organisation or an apprenticeship program that would enhance the future up-skilling of Australian workers. Of course there would evidently be some costs associated with administrative and compliance changes, but this is still something to consider for the longer-term benefit of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have raised this issue with the finance minister, but the matter cuts across a whole range of portfolio areas. It cuts across finance, treasury, employment, industry, immigration and small business. Therefore, having a broad-ranging inquiry or committee established could help by fleshing out all of the details necessary, looking at the structure of these payments and the outcomes of any possible changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting the economy back on track, being more productive, supporting small business and industry, and creating jobs are key areas of focus for the Abbott government. Looking at how we can see money employers pay to workers make a greater contribution to the Australian economy is certainly something I believe is at least worth looking at. This would be in addition to the positive measures the coalition is already taking to fix Labor's economic mess and mismanagement and provide greater incentives for business and industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also implementing practical ways to boost education and training and give a wider range of people greater access to education and training opportunities. We are reducing the regulatory burden for small businesses by cutting red tape costs by about $1 billion every year. We are lowering the company tax rate by 1.5 per cent from July next year. We want to abolish the carbon and mining taxes and are making a record investment in Australian infrastructure, creating jobs in the process of doing this. For the first time ever, the government will provide financial assistance for students studying diplomas and is providing loans of up to $20,000 for apprentices—and we do need more of our own apprentices. More support will be offered for disadvantaged students through a new scholarship scheme, and we are removing all loan fees for FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP, meaning equal access to loans for students no matter where they study. I believe the backpacker superannuation situation can also be improved— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Just over 13 years ago—lucky 13—a conservative government was shaken to its core as a result of criticism about the way it was hurting voters. The criticism did not come from the government's opponents; it came from within; from a federal president of the Liberal Party, no less.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2001, conservatives had been pummelled in state elections, and backbenchers and federal ministers were privately complaining about how their 'leadership is not listening' and 'party meetings are a waste of time'. A Prime Minister and Treasurer were seen to have gone out of their way to alienate traditional Liberal supporters. Government leadership was seen to be tricky on issues like petrol. It was seen to be relying on fine print to change the impression that people might have had at the time of the election. Sounds similar. A conservative government was ignoring its base. It had to be dragged kicking and screaming to fix government mistakes. Within a five-page memo penned by then federal Liberal president Shane Stone lay the ultimate label to haunt a conservative government. One of their own condemned them by saying, memorably, that this was a government that was 'tricky, mean and out of touch'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From this floor of parliament I make a request on behalf of hapless coalition backbenchers choking on their own fear: who will be their Shane Stone? Who will tell this government they are being tricky, mean and out of touch like their conservative predecessors? It has only taken one budget for Australia to realise that conservative governments are all alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the worst and most punishing budgets in recent memory, targeting the most vulnerable in our society. The fallout and anger directed towards the coalition since the budget's release is understandable. It is anger not just from within this place but throughout the community. It does not take an Ian Macdonald in the Senate to question the merits of the government's approach; Australia feels the pain of the cuts but also feels disbelief seeing a prime minister at that dispatch box argue that a cut is not a cut, arguing against reality—</span>

I think it is an issue that has had a great deal of attention in the past depending on particular politicians attending it. It has been watched with great interest.</span>

I think we all extend our very best wishes to them, and all strength to their fundraising efforts this evening. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWR" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PARKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:30</span>):  It was my pleasure this week to host the mayor, Logan Howlett and his wife, Pat, and three councillors from the City of Cockburn, Philip Eva, Steven Portelli and Yaz Mubarakai. There were here in Canberra to participate in the National General Assembly of Local Government. I know they gained a lot through their involvement in this year's NGAA program, and they brought with them their perspective and experience as representatives of an important local government in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also participated in a breakfast meeting yesterday with the National Growth Areas Alliance and I am grateful to the member for Franklin, the shadow minister for regional development and local government, for organising and hosting that valuable opportunity for a number of members to hear some of the specific needs and challenges that face growing outer metropolitan communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Cockburn in my electorate is a member of the alliance and, in addition to being one of the most significant growth areas in WA, it is also one of the fastest growing local governments in Australia. The National Growth Areas Alliance made an important budget submission this year, noting that the local governments within the alliance absorbed 35 per cent of Australia's population growth between the last two censuses, and calling on the federal government to provide a growth fund to support critical initiatives in areas like transport infrastructure and training and skills development. Investment in these areas is essential if growth areas are to function at their best, enabling their residents to participate fully in the economic and social life of our cities. The reality is we will not see the kind of coordinated and integrated growth we need, with the kind of sustainability and amenity outcomes that Australians should expect, if the development of growth areas is not carefully guided and appropriately resourced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have explained before the wonderful and catalytic effect of the Perth-Mandurah rail line and growth in the City of Cockburn, and credit must continue to go to the member for Perth in relation to the achievement of that visionary project during her time as minister in the West Australian Labor government. Now it is up to the current WA government to do its part and for the current federal government to overcome its inexplicable aversion to public transport. In my role as the federal representative of the people of Cockburn, I have worked hard with local government representatives to close the gap between the pace of residential development and the lagging provision of community infrastructure to match that growth and support those households and families. As part of the Labor government that took local government, city planning and public transport seriously, and knew the enormous benefit of public assets and services, I was pleased to help deliver projects like the new fire and emergency services headquarters, the new Coogee surf lifesaving club and the new Cockburn integrated health and community facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the mayor and councillors from the City of Cockburn for their good company this week and I encourage interested members to consider the National Growth Areas Alliance advocacy campaign, which is aptly titled 'Bring the Basics Within Reach—Jobs and Services for Growing Outer Suburbs'.</span>

                  <a href="E0J" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEENAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Stirling</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Justice</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  I recently had the opportunity to visit the Quan The Am Buddhist Association in my electorate of Stirling. I met with the venerable nuns and also the temple representative, Mr Binh Loc. The Buddhist centre does some excellent work within the electorate by assisting people through their counselling services, English lessons and meditation classes. The centre also offers free meals to the homeless and to families who are struggling to make ends meet. The organisation does a wonderful job providing basic services for those who need them the most in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first met with representatives at the temple during the celebration of Ullambana Day, they were delivering all their classes using a whiteboard. They indicated to me at the time they were in dire need of electronic equipment to assist them with their service presentations. That is why I am pleased that I have secured a $2,000 funding grant for the centre to purchase a new laptop, screen and projector to use during the variety of classes they run. The contribution the association makes in our local area is invaluable and it was a great pleasure to be able to assist in their good work through this funding grant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently also had the pleasure of meeting with Mr Graham McKenzie-Smith and Mr Robert Gianatti from the Royal Australian Engineers Association of Western Australia to confirm that the coalition government was approving their $3,000 grant application as part of their Saluting Their Service program. The organisation received a grant to help publish Mr McKenzie-Smith's book <span style="font-style:italic;">Sappers in the West: Army Engineers in Western Australia 1851-2012. </span>Mr McKenzie-Smith spent a long time researching material for this book, including at the Australian War Memorial here in Canberra. I was pleased to read a copy of the draft book and to gain some excellent insight into the important role that Army engineers have played in Western Australian military history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Saluting Their Service initiative aims to honour the sacrifice and service of Australian service men and women in wars, conflict and peace operations. This book will help to promote an appreciation and understanding of the role that those who served have played in shaping our nation. With the Anzac Centenary year approaching next year, the publishing of this book is an excellent contribution to documenting Western Australia's history. I would like to congratulate Mr McKenzie-Smith on that achievement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great privilege to be able to help both of these worthy community organisations who contribute so much to my community of Stirling in different ways. I would like to thank both the Quan The Am Buddhist Association and the Royal Australian Engineers Association of Western Australia for the invaluable contributions they have made to my electorate of Stirling.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:35</span>):  Last week I had the pleasure of meeting with Ms Sinke Wesho, Ms Biftu Gutama and Mr Jamal Makuria, who are members of the Oromo community in my electorate. We met to discuss the plight of the Oromo people, who live in Ethiopia and 10 other countries in eastern Africa. The Oromos are the single largest ethnic and indigenous group in Ethiopia. They comprise more than 30 million people, out of Ethiopia's population of 90 million people. However, for a long time these indigenous Oromo people have faced persecution from the Ethiopian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the 2011 census there were 4,489 Ethiopians living in Victoria. I am advised that many people of Ethiopian background who live in Australia, like Sinke Wesho, have deep concerns about what the Ethiopian government is doing to its people in Ethiopia. According to Ms Wesho, the Ethiopian government has recently unveiled its integrated master plan for the capital, Addis Ababa, which aims to incorporate smaller townships surrounding the city of Addis Ababa into the major city. The consequence of this particular plan is that farmers in and around these smaller towns are being forced off their land. The action will, unchecked, force two million Oromo farmers and their families off their land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ms Wesho has advised that Ethiopia is in turmoil. The Oromo people are in a dire situation due to the political instability in the country. For example, on 25 April 2014 the Ethiopian government opened fire with live bullets on Oromo students who were protesting against this master plan, which would, as I said, evict two million farmers off their land. According to Ms Wesho, this master plan is a systematic strategy to evict the Oromos from their capital city and to evacuate the citizens around the capital in order to destroy their identity—the cultural, political and social aspects of the Oromo people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is deeply disturbing to hear from Ms Wesho that Oromo university students and residents were killed, arrested and imprisoned, basically for protesting peacefully and protesting for a fundamental human right. According to Ms Wesho, the International Oromo Youth Association urgently requests the following actions to be taken in an attempt to pressure the Ethiopian government to stop terrorising the peaceful Oromo protesters. Firstly, they want the 30,000 Oromo people who are actually in prison released and not subjected to torture and harassment in jail. Secondly, they want the Ethiopian government to immediately stop this forceful displacement of the Oromo people. Thirdly, they want the international community to act in favour of and support the innocent civilian populace that is seeking a fundamental human right. Punitive actions should be contemplated by this government and by the international community in a campaign to support the Oromo people and a campaign for freedom of expression. I would certainly like to thank Ms Wesho and her companions for meeting with me and I will continue to raise their concerns in this place on behalf of the Oromo people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3A" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WYATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:38</span>):  Last week I launched my Fight for a Safer Intersection campaign in Forrestfield and my community safer streets survey. The intersection of Hale Road and Woolworths Drive is unique in that, while Hale Road is a significant local road under the jurisdiction of the Shire of Kalamunda, Woolworths Drive is a private driveway into the Forrestfield Forum and the Marketplace shopping centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The two roads meet at a T-junction and shoppers and surrounding businesses have described to me time and time again the numerous near misses they experience or see every single day from cars pulling out onto Hale Road from Woolworths Drive. The driver is not the problem; the intersection is. I said last week that it is time to finally make the intersection safer. If you were to visit the shopping centre and to ask shoppers what they thought of that intersection, I have no doubt that they would all share with you a horror story about near misses. It is important to note that I am not apportioning blame to any stakeholder on this matter, but I am saying that it is time to all get together to address the problem before someone is seriously injured. Families and workers should not have to risk their safety when they go down the road to visit the shops to get their lunch, do their weekly family shop, visit the doctor, go to the gym, get dinner for the family, buy new clothes or get a haircut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone said to me recently that they did not think that the intersection is a problem because not many key stakeholders have received official complaints. This is sad because many in Forrestfield have just accepted the dangerous intersection as a daily fact of life. I want the people of Forrestfield and the surrounding suburbs to know that I have heard them. I have heard their complaints and concerns, and I commit myself to fighting for as long as possible to make that intersection safer. I will make sure that the residents of Forrestfield have a loud voice and are heard by those who can make a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I am asking residents and shoppers and small business owners to join my fight for a safer intersection. All the residents have to do is visit my office and fill out the survey or look out for it in their letterbox if they live in the surrounding streets. I have also asked local businesses to place a survey on the counter and encourage shoppers to join the fight for a safer shopping experience. People can also visit my website and fill out a survey online. I want to know what they think will make the intersection safer. It is time for their voices to be heard on this very important local issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On July, I will be inviting the key stakeholders, including the Shire of Kalamunda and the shopping centre, to come together to review the responses of my community safer streets survey and to set a plan to work toward real safety outcomes for the residents who use the intersection of Hale Road and Woolworths Drive in Forrestfield every single day. This is part of my plan to build a stronger safer local community for Forrestfield, and I welcome suggestions and ideas on how to make the intersection safer.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  It is that time of year in Blair where we have many agricultural and country shows. Let me congratulate the following people: President, Rob Krause, and Secretary, Lyndell Blanch, from the Marburg Show Society; President, Trevor Wessling, and Secretary, Althea Hutch, from the Kilcoy Show Society; President, Marcia Cruickshank, and Secretary, Micky Hasted, from the Ipswich Show Society; President, Michael Jess, and Secretary, Greg Pease, from the Esk Show Society; President, Noel Kammholz, and Secretary, Janine Schultz, from the Lowood Show Society; President, Peter Eggleston, and Secretary, Lynne Teske, from the Toogoolawah Show Society; and President, Barry Embrey, and Secretary, Kate Lenihan, from the Rosewoood Show Society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shows that are held in Blair have long and proud histories. Each has been held for over 100 years, and the Ipswich show is approaching its 150th anniversary. The histories of the shows and their communities are marked by good times and bad, by war, drought and flood, and their stories are of cohesion, commitment and endurance. They share many common features but each reflects the history, character and environment of the country areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Show weekend is a much anticipated high point of the year for these communities. You see the smiles on the faces as you drive into town. The shows bring a lot of noise and colour and there is a bit of electricity in the air. I loved listening to the primary school kids from Mount Kilcoy State School singing <span style="font-style:italic;">Advance Australia Fair</span> at the Kilcoy show. Also, I loved talking to the young people from West Moreton Anglican College who do agricultural studies and proudly showed their school colours and showed off their best cattle. I also enjoy having burgers and tea with the blokes and women from the Rotary Club of Ipswich City, bacon and egg burgers, of course, with the Toogoolawah State High School P&amp;C and you cannot go to the Marburg Show without having vegetables and silverside prepared by the local CWA from Glamorgan Vale. It is the smell of the country—actually, sometimes you get it on your boots! The shows draw thousands and thousands of people to these country towns. It is good for the economy and good for the environment as well. Also, I never leave without biscuits, often by the Esk Girl Guides, and a few jars of jam and a pocket full of raffle tickets—that is for sure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the last election, I held my 59th mobile office at the Lowood show and the 60th in Toogoolawah. This weekend I will be at the Rosewood show. I was very proud to open the Lowood show recently and fortunately it did not rain—it nearly always rains at the Lowood show. But people always come in for a chat and to raise issues, and I can tell you that they are pretty vocal about their displeasure about this budget, particularly the GP tax, the hike on petrol excise and also the raising of the pension age in the budget of betrayal that the Abbott government has undertaken. I want to congratulate the volunteers, the judges, the stewards, the people at the ticket gate, the CWA ladies, who I reckon cook the best in Queensland, the St John's ambulance and so many, many more. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DANBY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne Ports</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  Prayer vigils are being held across Australia for three Israeli teenagers kidnapped on 12 June 2014. The three boys—Eyal Yifrah, 19; Naftali Fraenkel, 16; and Gilad Shaar, 16—are seminary students in Kfar Etzion. They were kidnapped while hitchhiking a ride home last Thursday night. A nationwide petition has been circulated calling for the Australian government to convey to the Palestinian authority that it should coordinate with Israel to secure the release of these three teenagers. Indeed, Mr Abbas and the Palestinian Authority have pledged assistance in finding the boys. This is to be welcomed. However, Hamas, Fatah's new partner, condemned Palestinian cooperation, referring to the kidnappers as 'heroes'. It is also welcome that Egypt is cooperating with search efforts, while other nations and the UN Secretary-General have condemned the kidnapping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the chamber that Hamas, which is officially listed by this parliament as a terrorist organisation, has denied involvement. Some months ago it published an 18-page manual on abduction techniques entitled 'Guide for the Kidnapper'. This outlined the use of pistols with silencers, back-up cars, the choice of abductions on rainy days, the renting of hide-outs to avoid suspicion, and suggestions for refraining from announcing the outcome of kidnappings until the victims are secured in a safe house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many NGOs have formal and informal workings with Hamas. Some such as UNRA, Oxfam, Human Rights Watch and the Red Cross are beneficiaries of Australian taxpayers' financial support. I am aware that at least the International Committee of Red Cross and Human Rights Watch have spoken out against these abductions, and I trust that other NGOs working in the region will follow suit. The next step for such NGOs should be to use their influence on the Hamas organisation to secure the release of these teenagers unharmed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not go into the moral swamp of the comparison of the arrest of people who throw rocks on cars on public highways. They are being arrested under law and taken to juvenile courts. Compare that with the kidnapping of these three teenagers. Everyone should abide by the laws of countries. Kidnapping young people like this, indeed any people, for ransom is a terrible thing. It is a terrible thing not only for their sake but also for the sake of their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the sake of the peace process between the two peoples, the Palestinian people and the Israeli people, these boys should be returned safe and sound. A lasting and fair peace will not be possible when students cannot get to and from school without full security.<span style="font-style:italic;"> (Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  I take the opportunity to raise concerns on behalf of the Genoa and district community relating to the corner on the Princes Highway which has been the scene of several serious accidents, including three fatalities in recent years. Last Sunday, there was another tragic accident which cost one life. I would like to express my condolences to the family and loved ones of the man who was killed when his car failed to negotiate the bend opposite the Genoa Hall. Two people were seriously injured in that accident and we wish them well for their recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to refer to a letter from June 2013, which was sent from the Genoa town committee to the state minister for transport. I quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For over 15 years, the Genoa town committee and Genoa Hall committee have made continued representations to VicRoads regarding the condition of the Princes Highway adjacent to Genoa community hall at Scrubby Creek. This small community is sick and tired of being fobbed off by continual bureaucratic nonsense by VicRoads as accidents continue to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also made representations to VicRoads and relevant ministers over the past three to four years, trying to have the speed limit reduced from its current 100 kilometres per hour to 80 kilometres per hour through the Genoa township. VicRoads' most recent response indicated that VicRoads will be completing road safety improvements, installing curb alignment markers, installing additional closely-spaced guideposts and installing additional large curb warning signs with high-visibility 80-kilometre-advisory speeds on a red background.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With all due respect to the VicRoads staff concerned, that has not fixed the problem and it will not ever satisfy the concerns of the local residents. I acknowledge that I am not an engineer, but I firmly believe there are three things that need to happen as soon as possible on the section of road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, VicRoads should install 80-kilometre-an-hour speed restrictions zones for the Genoa township section of the Princes Highway. It is a one-to-two-kilometre section of road. There is no impost on the travelling public to have to have an 80-kilometre zone through the town to try to reduce speed around this dangerous corner. Secondly, some immediate temporary works need to be undertaken to address the safety of the corner itself. At the absolute minimum, there should be wire rope barriers established to prevent cars running off the road at high speed and colliding with trees. Thirdly, the corner needs to be completely overhauled. It needs to have more extensive work done, to be realigned in such a manner that it can improve the safety for all road users on this stretch of the Princes Highway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be working with the Genoa and district community to seek funding opportunities under the federal black spots program, which specifically targets sections of road with an extensive crash history. This is an important program. I am pleased the federal government is continuing to roll it out. It will have opportunities now through a change in the eligibility criteria to make it easier for regional communities to compete for additional funding to improve safety on roads right throughout regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not seeking to apportion blame in any way whatsoever for the most recent accidents, but those who have travelled on that road understand that it is a dangerous corner. However, for anyone who does not know the road, it can catch them unawares and have terrible ramifications, as it has in the past. I concur with the local community: urgent action is required. Yesterday, I spoke to a local resident, Peter Allard. He has campaigned for this issue. He said to me, 'Hopefully this time we will be able to get something done.'</span>

As a new member of parliament, I find these are a great way to understand what the community is thinking and what actions we might undertake to assist. Last Thursday I attended, with other Lalor locals, a very interesting street meeting on the corner of Spring and Bourke Streets in central Melbourne. Estimates were that around 30,000 concerned residents turned up. On Friday I held a mobile office with state shadow transport minister, Jill Hennessy, in Point Cook, and it was the same—lots of people with lots of concerns about the budget. What were the concerns that were raised? The deeply unfair nature of this year's federal budget—cuts to pensions, cuts to health, cuts to education, cuts to universities, cuts to training, cuts to family payments, the introduction of the GP and health co-payments, increases to the fuel tax, unfair conditions for the young unemployed, increased university costs and higher interest repayment rates. Thirty thousand Victorians gave a very clear message last Thursday that this budget is unfair, with the most vulnerable doing the heavy lifting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government want to re-create Australian society. They seem to want us to be a country of haves and have-nots. They want to break the social contract that this great nation is built on, the egalitarian dream. The Treasurer went to great lengths recently to explain that working Australians contribute one month's income to welfare recipients. I am keen, as were many people who spoke to me last Thursday and Friday, to see the comparison with how much the taxpayer contributes to negative gearing, superannuation concessions for the wealthy, family trusts and other juicy items in the gamut of things our taxes go to support. Minister Pyne is similarly taking every opportunity to paint a picture of the poor taxpayer contributing to higher education as an unfair burden, when in fact we all know, and Australians know, that these funds will be recouped by the taxpayer through higher tax contributions from graduates if and when they earn the big bucks that Minister Pyne assures us they will. As a former teacher, and with a nurse for a niece, I know that some university educated people certainly will not be earning those big bucks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians I speak to—those I spoke to last Thursday, those I spoke to on Friday, those I spoke to on Saturday at the football in my electorate—are happy to see taxes paid being utilised on education and health services and assisting those who require additional assistance, because they understand that social mobility and equity are essential for a productive economy and a fair society. Certainly that was the message I heard loud and clear last week in my electorate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALEXANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  I rise to inform the House of a true champion of the Australian-Chinese community in my electorate of Bennelong. Hugh Lee is a leader in the truest sense. He is a humble and intelligent man, whose key focus is the betterment of the local community. As President of the Australian Asian Association of Bennelong, better known as the AAAB, Hugh Lee was one of the first to congratulate me on my election in 2010, and he immediately asked me to serve as patron of the association. Hugh Lee also serves on a variety of different local committees as well as being a board member for the Ryde Hunters Hill Symphony Orchestra. As a result, Hugh was a worthy recipient of an Order of Australia medal last year, for which I was delighted to write a supportive letter of reference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year Hugh joined me, along with the President of the Eastwood Korean Chamber of Commerce, Jason Koh, in a campaign for CCTV cameras to be installed in Eastwood to deter instances of small crime. A funding request had been rejected by the Ryde city council in 2011. As representatives of the local Chinese and Korean communities, Hugh and Jason explained to me that many offences were not being reported due to cultural differences. Despite all the great efforts of the Eastwood police, these concerns have remained. In response, in August last year I announced a $200,000 federal grant to the City of Ryde for the installation of CCTV cameras. The recent unprovoked violent assault on a Chinese man in Eastwood led to Hugh and state MP Victor Dominello joining me to circulate a petition to local businesses. Within one week, we had over 160 signatures, which Hugh and Jason presented to the council. Last week, the council announced their intention to apply for this funding. Hugh and Jason's efforts were central to this decision.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hugh Lee recently announced his resignation as President of the AAAB, citing that he simply had too much on his plate. Always modest, he claims he is moving aside to let another community leader, Danny Yap, bring new ideas to this important local community group. Hugh Lee is a stalwart of the great community of Bennelong, and I am honoured to have been—and to continue to be—connected with him on many levels within the great electorate of Bennelong. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hugh, I thank you for your fine efforts in all your leadership roles in our community. I look forward to continuing to work with you for many years. Hugh, you are a good man and I am privileged to call you 'friend'.</span>

The budget actually seeks to address some of the what are now uncontested challenges that are part of the financial trajectory that the previous government left for the incoming Abbott government. We have heard the Parliamentary Budget Office make the point about how important the need is for action and timely action. We have even heard the opposition leader acknowledge that there is a task to be dealt with. We have heard other expert commentators describing the need for us to take responsible, modest but thoughtful action now so as to guard against the debt and deficit trajectory that had been left for us by the previous government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to remember what the debt and deficit trajectory is that Labor has left for this country and for the incoming government, and how we have had to deal with those budget settings—those expenditure predictions and the debt forecasts—that see us on track, if no action is taken, to accumulate a gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those who are listening, let us round that up to $700 billion—that is, seven with 11 zeroes! It is an extraordinary amount of debt and the nation has little to show for it. It recognises the profligacy and the desire to spend and spend and spend some more, not having to realise that there is a need to finance that expenditure. And where it is expenditure that is not funded by revenues from today, as reflected in the historically large series of deficits that the previous government oversaw, that then incurs expense for the nation, our country and for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise that Labor may not always have appreciated the harm that it was causing. I do not think it is in anybody's wish or will to disadvantage subsequent generations by being irresponsible in decision making today. I am not suggesting that Labor was consciously aiming to create the problem that it has left for this country. I will give them the benefit of the doubt. But the lesson is clear: we have seen this before. We have seen Labor go down this pathway and leave it for an incoming coalition government to fix the mess: to make sure that we all make a contribution today to build our prospects and our opportunities for the future—to deliver the great promise of our country, and that is opportunity, prospects for a better life and a better quality of life for subsequent generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now recognised that if action is not taken we are diminishing that prospect and those promises for subsequent generations. So I am pleased to be here to communicate once again not only the case for action but the thoughtfulness in the particular measures that are being presented to this parliament and to the Australian public. As I travel around the country, I am constantly reminded of the call from the citizenry for political leaders that take a longer term view, that speak frankly about the circumstances and canvass the options before our nation, that the parliament does think about building our capacity for the future and is making important decisions today that might not be easy but are crucial to our longer term prospects. That is what the nation and its citizens ask of me, and I am sure that they do of you too, sir. This budget does all of those things. It is not without its challenges to communicate the importance of some of these measures, but it is crucial that we get an understanding across to the Australian public that if we want those better prospects for the future this budget, now the Economic Action Strategy, is to be implemented.</span>

I take the minister to Budget Paper No. 2, page 203, and the changes to pension indexation. Could the minister confirm a saving of $449 million over five years by cutting the indexation rate of the pension and other equivalent payments, for example, the single parent payments? Could the minister provide any further information as to the breakdown of those savings? How much is from the age pension and how much is from carers in particular, and is there any other information the minister may choose to share with the chamber? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the minister indicate to the chamber separately what modelling the government has undertaken on the impact of these changes on individual pensioners? Can the minister confirm a figure by which the government estimates the average pensioner would have been worse off had these changes not been implemented? Particularly, can the minister confirm that if these changes had been implemented, for example, for the past four years, an average age pensioner might be $1,500 a year worse off? Has the government undertaken that analysis and does the minister have the view that that analysis might inform the impact on the average pensioner of these changes going forward?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  The budget paper outlines the broad impact of the adjustment to the indexation measure to see it adjusted to the kind of indexation Labor introduced for the family payments arrangement. In no respect, in no way and with no reasonable characterisation is it a cut to anything. What it reflects is an ongoing commitment for a twice-yearly adjustment to our pension rates to give confidence and certainty for those who are reliant upon that income support that it will increase with the cost of living to maintain its buying power into the future. What is crucial about this budget is that it seeks to recognise the importance of the safety net, of the social security system and of the range of programs aimed to properly support the vulnerable, those who have already made their contribution to the economy and those who have particular needs for which we as a generous society should be providing. So in the budget it characterises what the adjustment in the rate of increase will mean in an aggregate sense. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To carry out the analysis that the shadow Treasurer is speaking about, one would need to include all of the ins and outs. I think that the shadow minister would agree that in terms of the average savings to households from the abolition of the carbon tax—something Labor says that it is in favour of terminating but when it comes to this parliament it chooses not to carry through those statements in public—we know that it is on average a $550 benefit. We also know that if Labor continues to obstruct the abolition of the carbon tax, the rate of the carbon tax will actually increase at from 1 July. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we have done with this measure is not cut pensions. We have adjusted the rate at which the pension will continue to increase twice annually. We have also left in place the so-called compensation that was available when the carbon tax was implemented. That compensation, important in its terms of an increase to these fortnightly payments, remains. Our ambition is not only to take the carbon tax out and therefore reduce those cost-of-living pressures on households of all types, but also to leave the so-called compensation in place. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BILLSON:</span>
                    </a>  So that is our strategy: take those cost-of-living pressures off households, maintain the buying power of the pensions through an ongoing twice-yearly indexation, change the rate at which it increases and therefore ensure that the very benefits that are important to the vulnerable and to those that have already made their contribution to our nation are in fact not vulnerable themselves because of our inability to finance them into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I think those relying on the payments that are addressed on page 203 of Budget Paper No. 2 can be confident that their interests have been reflected. The net impact of the adjustment in the rate of increase of those pensions is captured in that table. To delve into a household by household analysis beyond what has already been published would involve a lot of analysis of other measures in the budget that are designed to improve the situation of households, take pressure off the costs of living and help build that strong, safe and secure economy and nation that we are working to achieve.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  Eden-Monaro is a rural electorate and it depends heavily on small business as an employer in the region. In fact, in regional Australia, after you go past schools and government agencies providing services in rural towns, it is the private sector in terms of the small business community that is the principal employer. We have recently come into government. We have unemployment problems across the Eden-Monaro region. For example, in the Eurobodalla Shire we have an unemployment rate that is above seven per cent, which is way above the national average. Indeed, part of that problem is people employed by small businesses have lost their jobs. We are seeing that across regional towns in the Eurobodalla, Bega Valley, Bombala, Cooma-Monaro and Palerang shires in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I understand that across the nation some 519,000 jobs were lost in small business over the last six years, which is a very distressing fact. The government is putting in place an economic action strategy that I understand will help secure some one million jobs in the next five years and potentially two million jobs in the next 10 years. Part of that will be the abolition of the carbon tax. I was in Cooma last week and visited a florist. When people talk about the carbon tax they do not often think about florists, but they were very significantly hit by the carbon tax because refrigeration is a very important part of the work of a florist. They were urging me to ensure that the carbon tax was abolished in this term of parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to understand your comments with respect to the carbon tax abolition and the importance that has for small business right across the Australian nation. The other thing I want you to potentially make some remarks on is the significant review of competition policy that has been announced by the government and is being funded in the current budget. Can you give us an explanation of the progress of that competition review? Indeed, I also note in the Treasury portfolio that funding will be there also for changes to the franchising code of conduct, which is another very important thing for a number of small businesses in my electorate. Minister, I pitch you those questions and I look forward to the answers.</span>

I joined the member at a small business forum in Batemans Bay. It was fabulously well attended. The message was clear: 'We understand the need for the Economic Action Strategy, so get on with it.' 'Get on with it' was the clear message that was coming through, as people were looking for a predictable, stable and dependable economic setting and conduct by the Commonwealth government. They want stability, predictability and certainty in the environment in which they are making decisions to mortgage their house, to take risk, to employ and to grow and develop their business. This is what, I am pleased to say, our economic action strategy in the budget seeks to deliver. We are keen not to have that strategy impeded. That is why getting the carbon tax through is so crucial to ensuring that that improved economic environment is available for our creators of wealth and opportunity, the small business people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member talked about the 519,000 jobs in small business—an awfully large number—that were lost under the previous Labor government. They seem not to want to talk about or recognise that. Maybe it is because they might not be union jobs or they are not all in one location. This represents a real hit to the wealth creators, those courageous men and women who mortgage their house and sometimes place their sanity and personal wellbeing at risk as they toil in a difficult economic climate to create a livelihood for themselves, for others and for their community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeking to arrest that decline in small business employment. It accounted for 53 per cent of the private-sector workforce when the Howard government left office. But after Labor was recently tossed out, and a change was called for Australian small business men and women, it is down to 42 per cent of the private-sector workforce. Those are the circumstances we have inherited. The clear message from my travels around the country and in my own community is, 'Please, no more of the same.' The last thing they want from an incoming government is more of what they had under Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget there are a range of measures. The member for Eden-Monaro, who is very alert and attuned to these issues, went to the issue of the carbon tax. The carbon tax hurts and punishes small business in a very particular and pernicious way. With all the carve-outs and hush money—the compensation that was made available by the previous government to abate the harm and the hurt of the carbon tax—small business got no direct compensation. In this chamber, they were told to 'suck it up or pass it on'—I think that was the term used. There was not a moment of appreciation from the previous Labor government of just how difficult the economic climate was, of how hard it is to simply pass on costs in a marketplace where we need to be world class, where there are cost-conscious consumers, where we need to build confidence, build spending power, remove cost-of-living pressures and reduce the costs of doing business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Eden-Monaro also touched on florists, which is a very good example. The carbon tax plays its evil impact through the florists. Those opposite think florists do not need to worry about the carbon tax. But florists have refrigeration costs. Who can forget R404 gas, which, because of its CO2 equivalence, went up in price by some 400 per cent? Small businesses have shown me fridges that they used to operate that needed to be repaired. Because of the cost impact of the carbon tax, they choose not to repair those fridges. And then there are energy costs—the costs of keeping the lights on. You see this right across the economy—and it compounds. Labor said they did not want a carbon tax. They promised they would not implement it—but they did. And now they want to terminate it—but they will not. This tax just builds and builds all the way through the supply chain. In regional communities such as Eden-Monaro, if Labor had their way, the carbon tax would be extended to heavy road transport. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a legacy of Labor, the carbon tax is currently legislated to go up again on 1 July. My advice would be to speak with your local small businesses, as I do, and remind them that we are doing our utmost to get rid of the carbon tax, to energise enterprise in this economy and to get rid of those headwinds and burdens that are slowing the growth and potential of small business. Our work is to turn around the harm of six years of Labor. We are keeping at that. We can say to our constituents: 'We know what our plan is and we want to get on with it. Labor are not only the cause of the harm but are now standing in the road of the remedies as well.'</span>

I put it to him again: does the government have modelling on the impact of the change of the indexation on pensioners? The minister referred to the 'evil' carbon tax and other matters, but that is not what the question refers to. My question simply refers to the change in the indexation of the age pension and other pension payments. Budget Paper No. 2, at page 203, indicates savings of $449 million over the next five years by changing the way of indexing the pension. Let me put this to the minister very clearly and in a very straightforward fashion: can the minister confirm that this is $449 million that pensioners will not be receiving, that will be cut from their income?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former Treasurer is so proud of his work that his ALP website does not even mention he was the former Treasurer. It is quite bizarre. It talks about 'non-this' and 'non-that'. He seems to have been a non-Treasurer, according to his own published material. Putting the Labor Party website—and the non-ness we are seeing from Labor—to one side, the adjustments in the rate of increase, the twice annual rate of increase, to those pension payments are clearly there on page 203 of  Budget Paper No. 2. The numbers are there. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Treasurer then went on to talk about what the household impact was and I quite reasonably pointed to there being other influences on the net household impact that Labor wants to ignore. The Labor way is to look at important issues and the strategy for our nation through a straw. All they want to look at is the little microspot at the end of the straw. They do not want to take into account the other changes, the other measures, the action we are taking to remove cost-of-living pressures by repealing Labor's pernicious carbon tax—which is going up again on 1 July.</span>

                    </a>  They joke about it over here. They have not taken a moment to analyse the impact of the carbon tax on households across Australia—not to mention the impact on the small business community, whom they have loaded up with this burden. It is lead in the saddlebag and an impediment to the prospects of small businesses, preventing them from growing employment and economic opportunities in this country. They are not the slightest bit interested in that. They come in here wanting to talk about a part of the budget that addresses a section of our community that has been frightened by the Labor Party's shrill exaggerations and negativity, by what I think has been a very one-sided critique from Labor. They have not sought to look at the other budget measures aimed at improving and enhancing the security and situation of those the Labor Party is talking about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the shadow Treasurer wants to talk about impacts, we should talk about all of the impacts. That is what my answer was about—that is about being honest and frank with people. That is the contrast between this budget and the fiction and fudged numbers we saw with Labor's budgets. They promised these rivers of revenue, not realising that the nominal growth rate was not inextricably linked to a growth in company tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember, as we travelled around Western Australia, hearing from small businesses about how difficult the economy was under Labor, about how many of them were trading in a profitless environment. All they had to do was show an interest in what was going on in the economy and Labor, when in government, would have known their budget was fiction. They would have known simply by listening to people who have a lot of skin in the game—people with mortgaged houses and people who spend every waking moment thinking about their enterprise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is truthful, it is dependable, the figures are robust, and the growth trajectories and some of the key assumptions have—unlike anything Labor has done—been consistent through two economic statements in a row. This is the difference between this budget and the ones that Labor introduced. The numbers are dependable and reliable. What the shadow Treasurer did not want to talk about was important measures to support those who are on income support, measures to optimise their future opportunities, measures aimed at helping them get back into work and improve their own circumstances. These include incentives such as the Restart program, fabulously important for unemployed people over the age of 50.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to those mature age job seekers who have been out of work for some time, there is a $10,000 incentive through the Restart program. It says to employers, particularly small business employers, 'If you are thinking about recruiting one more person, recognise the experience, the wisdom, the workplace know-how and the capacity of mature age people.' Here is an incentive for those mature age people to get back into the economy, to be able to make an economic contribution if they are in a position to do so. There are a range of very positive measures in this budget. I commend those measures. What I am hearing as I travel around Australia is that people are hungry for the facts. When you give them the facts that are in the budget, they recognise the need for action. They understand that we are all making a contribution and they are encouraging us to continue to think about the future and prepare for it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I would like to thank the Minister for Small Business for his wonderful advocacy for the small business sector during his term in the portfolio, both in opposition and now in government. It is interesting to reflect that for six years of the previous government, and now in our current term in government, we have had the same person in this portfolio. I think the previous government had six ministers. It has provided the small to medium business sector with consistent representation and a consistent voice. This is a very important segment of our economy. As touched on earlier, six years ago it employed some 53 per cent of the workforce and it is now down to 43 per cent. But more importantly, in my electorate of Forde it employs a very large proportion of our workforce. There are small to medium businesses in construction, manufacturing and retail, and we have some 7½ thousand of those small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister was recently at one of our chamber breakfasts, which was greatly appreciated. One telling thing at that breakfast was when those businesses were asked if they would employ another person if red tape, regulation, the carbon tax and other imposts from the previous government were taken away and they almost unanimously said yes. We took 23 terrific policies to the election that we are now rolling out. Minister, this is a great opportunity for you to inform the House about how the initiatives outlined in our election policies and commitments are going to strengthen small businesses, not only in my electorate of Forde but also in the nation more generally.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  I thank the member for Forde for not only his insightful contribution but also his chairmanship of our small business policy committee. He has been a champion of small business right throughout his life. Here is a member of the coalition whose entire life, privately in a professional capacity and publicly, has been an agent of support, encouragement, counsel and assistance for the small business men and women of our country. I commend him for his lifetime of service to this important sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now in public office that work continues. It was the contribution of the member for Forde, the member for Eden-Monaro and the three amigos from Tasmania that helped shape the comprehensive small business policy that we took to the last election. In comparison Labor promised more of the same, and we know that was the last thing that the small business community wanted. This budget actually energises and resources the implementation of a vast number of those election commitments. We have said to the Australian public and to those small business men and women who risk so much and who show great courage to create opportunities for themselves and for others and livelihoods in their communities, your interests are too big and too important to ignore. It was a cry that we heard from the chamber movement, an understandable reflection of the revolving door of previous ministers with the name 'small business' often tacked to a long list of other things. We do not take it that way. My primary focus every day is on small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased that the Prime Minister has understood the importance of the small business community. The small business portfolio is not only included in cabinet and not distracted by a shopping list of other responsibilities but now embraced in the economic policy powerhouse of the Commonwealth—that is, the Treasury. So many of the policy settings that are shaped in Treasury create that entrepreneurial ecosystem that we talked about earlier that helps people decide whether they employ, invest, recruit and expand. Many of those measures are shaped within Treasury. I am pleased to join with Joe Hockey as a cabinet minister in that portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand the importance of the abolition of the carbon tax. There are billions of dollars of impost on our small business men and women. For those who are competing for opportunities here against importers, or who are seeking to grow their markets in overseas countries as exporters, this acts as a reverse tariff. It is lead in the saddlebag. I mentioned in the House our Socceroos last night taking on an extraordinary Dutch team—and your divided loyalties must have been troubling last night—but imagine if our team, in their Nike soccer boots, had five or six kilograms of lead in each of their boots and to keep up with some of those svelte and handsome Dutchman, like yourself, Sir, in the World Cup competition. We know that would be unfair. So we know that that is unfair in sport as it is in life. It is in our economy as well. That is why we want to abolish the carbon tax.</span>

                    </a>  You touched on the red tape reduction initiative—a billion dollars of red tape reduction, not just for the life of the government but each year. What a real discipline and challenge that is. Why? Because Labor thought what all small businesses wanted to do each day was wake up in the morning and wonder what the government wanted them to do for it next—what compliance or regulatory impost could they turn their minds to! It seemed to be what Labor thought small businesses had front of mind, when they really wanted to grow their businesses. That is a crucial area of our work.</span>

The shadow Treasurer, who once had responsibility for the ACCC, seemed completely disinterested, happy to have them technically insolvent before Christmas last year and on track to run out of cash in March. How on earth does that build confidence for consumers and small business?</span>

                    </a>  'How's it going?' Why? Because there is no interest. We have not heard a peep from Labor about that. Implementing the franchising reforms; making sure our procurement changes give small business a chance; implementing the drought support package, crucial for small businesses operating in farming communities; our Paid Parental Leave scheme, what a great measure to give small businesses the same opportunity to recruit that government and the big corporates have; the Emissions Reduction Fund, a chance for small businesses to participate in that; the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, a role with tools and teeth. There are so many opportunities. We are implementing our policies. I just wish Labor would get out of the road.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  We can only be glad that this show is appearing all this week and next. I want to ask a number of questions of the minister at the table. First, the budget provides hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to multinationals by delaying the reforms to the Offshore Banking Unit, $180 million; and deferring the start date of the legislative elements to improve tax compliance through third-party reporting and data-matching, $113 million. Minister, why has the government given $1.1 billion back to multinationals while ripping money away from pensioners and low-income Australians? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, does the minister agree with the Prime Minister's comments that the reintroduction of indexation of the fuel excise will 'act like a carbon tax'? Given the comments of the Prime Minister in the United States that the reintroduction of fuel excise indexation will act like a carbon tax, has Treasury conducted any modelling of the impact of fuel excise indexation on Australia's carbon emissions and, if not, why not? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the minister has not only told us that if we abolish the carbon price we will win the World Cup but also that it is evil, I wonder if he might tell us what adjective he would best use to describe the indexation of fuel excise, which, as the Prime Minister has said, acts like a carbon tax. Would it be 'immoral', 'wicked', 'unholy', 'sinful', 'ignoble', 'base', 'dishonourable', 'villainous', 'nefarious', 'sinister', 'vicious', 'malicious', 'demonic', 'devilish', 'diabolical', 'fiendish', or maybe simply 'black hearted'? And, Minister, why do the cuts to research and development tax incentive commence on 1 July 2014 when the reduction in the company tax rate, which it is purported to offset, does not commence until 1 July 2015?</span>

Wasn't it a surprise—he did not ask about co-payments! He's got form on that, hasn't he? Higher education co-payments—he has form on that as well. There are so many things he is not able to talk about. And that is probably why we got a professorial thesaurus articulation to fill out some of the time! There are so many areas of this budget where the member for Fraser simply cannot go. He has form. If he was being principled in his articulations at that time, you would have thought he would be one of the strongest advocates for many of the measures in this budget. But he chose not to talk about those things for which he has form. He chose to talk about some other changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He talked about the fuel indexation changes. In fact, I have just introduced legislation into the House to reintroduce fuel indexation in precisely the form introduced by the Hawke Labor government. But what is different about our approach is that we have implemented that measure to ensure that we can fund the nation's biggest infrastructure program. Going back to my earlier point: in my community and as I travel around the country, I consistently hear the call for a longer term view. They would like to see more of the resources that come to the Commonwealth being put into building our capacity and opportunity for the future, not going into consumption. They are concerned that we are borrowing $1 billion a month to finance what is essentially consumption expenditure. That $1 billion a month would be set to go up to $2.8 billion a month if Labor's policy settings were put in place. Yet they were not seeing the investment in our productive capacity as a nation. So we have introduced this measure to go some way towards funding $26 billion of road infrastructure projects, to build that infrastructure and productive capability for the 21st century economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it important? In Melbourne, we want to see the East West Link constructed. Labor have been all over the shop. I was going to say they have been talking out each side of the pie hole, but I thought that might have been taken as a slight against the Leader of the Opposition. They have been all over the place. I am not sure if they are for it or against it. But the communities that I represent know they are for it. That is because infrastructure like the East West Link has the capacity not only to support commuters but also to support commerce. It will support commerce in the direct construction phase and then in the ability of our economy to function through these infrastructure arteries—an important development—and the indexation that goes with it. What I am seeing and hearing is a call for that kind of infrastructure investment. But people also want to know that the funding of it can be sustained. That is why we have moved to reactivate the very indexation measure that Labor introduced. It will be interesting to see where they go with that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question then went to the carbon tax. I am not sure whether the member for Fraser is aware of it—he may have been writing a book or something at the time—but, under his team, the carbon tax is set to increase again from 1 July and, under Labor's policy articulation, it was to be extended to heavy road transport. If he followed this and did the analysis that he claims he does on some of his work in a professorial mode, he would know that the indexation of fuel excise has no net effect at all on off-road uses or on heavy transport for vehicles over 4½ tonnes. Why? Because they are offset; it does not amount to a tax that cascades, builds and grows through the economy. So his analysis that this is somehow the same as the carbon tax is patently wrong. In those productive areas of the economy—for off-road uses of the fuels that are covered by the fuel tax and excise regime and for on-road heavy vehicle uses—there is no impact. There is a net improvement because we have simplified the way in which those transactions of excise are calculated—they are rebated and there are road transport charges—so it was not down to the three decimal points that those opposite would love. The member for Fraser might love a third decimal point, but we think one decimal point is perfectly adequate. So those analogies are simply not relevant. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the member for Fraser is concerned about cost impacts on our economy and on households, then the honourable, thoughtful and analytical thing to do is get behind the abolition of the carbon tax. That is what he promised his citizens: that he was going to terminate the tax. No, Labor is running a protection racket for its carbon tax; it is set to go up from 1 July and, if their policy musings are to be believed, they want to extend it to heavy road transport as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I declare an interest first of all. Up until very recently my wife was a small business owner. She has relinquished herself of that nevertheless quite profitable burden and is now seeking an alternative business. I would like to follow up on a question that I asked the minister in question time the other day. It was in respect of the nearly 8,000 small businesses in my electorate of Lyons. I was replaying the question there because it was an excellent answer from the minister. In the question I did compliment the government on the fact that we now have the Minister for Small Business in cabinet. That is a really important initiative. It was a commitment that we went to the election with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We made a number of commitments in the lead-up to the election. I would like the minister to reflect on those and then answer some of my specific questions. In relation to paid parental leave, can the minister contextualise the productivity benefits that flow to small business being able to compete with the Public Service and big business on a level playing field and how that initiative is a piece of economic policy as opposed to a welfare measure? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My other specific question relates to one of the commitments we gave—and the minister has already commented on this, and I appreciate that—about a root and branch review of the competition policy in this country. That commitment was part of our 10-point plan to support small business that we took to the election in September. We said we would commit to a review of the competition framework to ensure the Australian law and policy settings promote a vibrant, competitive market in the economy and ensure small business is given a fair go. My question relates specifically to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act, which relates to the misuse of power. I note the comment you made before with respect to funding. Was it an issue of funding under the previous administration that removed the capacity of section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act to be used in the way that I think those who designed the act always intended it to be? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are my two specific questions. If I have an opportunity later on, I will probably have more.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BILLSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I thank the member for Lyons. There are 7,800 small businesses in his electorate. The member for Lyons was reflecting on a question he asked in the House. There are a couple things I would like to add to that. It has been some 200 days since anyone from Labor has asked me a question. Is small business of such little interest to Labor that they do not think it is worthy? I do not know how many questions we would have had over that sitting period, but it must be in the hundreds. It seems quite extraordinary. It is very instructive that, amongst those hundreds of questions since about mid-November, there has not been one question from Labor about anything to do with small business. That is quite extraordinary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast to that the member for Lyons asked a very good question. If I can draw from my earlier comments, some measures I have already touched upon—and I will not spend too much time on them again: the abolition of the carbon tax is crucial, the red tape reduction measure is very significant and having small business considerations front and centre in the big decisions and all the analytical work of Treasury is crucial as part of that proper recognition and respect that small business people need. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Lyons is absolutely right: the Paid Parental Leave scheme is a very important measure at so many levels. It is about ensuring that those people eligible for the coalition's Paid Parental Leave scheme can have their wage replacement set as the level for those payments. Why? I get feedback all the time from my own community and as I travel that if a family wishes to both pursue their economic objectives, through jobs, careers and engagement in the economy, and have a family it can be very difficult indeed. For many households two incomes are actually needed to meet the mortgage costs and the ongoing expenses of that household. And at a time when a family may have a newborn—a micro-human to care for—those costs just do not dramatically and miraculously overnight default back to some minimum wage level. They do not do that; those cost structures are still there. They need to meet the mortgage costs; they are still there. Those living expenses continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, we see far more generous paid parental leave schemes in government, in the public sector, than any small business employer could ever dream of offering. We see this in major corporates as well, so it seemed to be right and appropriate for some contributors to the economy to have access to that kind of benefit. But Labor wants to obstruct a very positive measure to see that same kind of support available to the people operating in our small businesses and family enterprises. Where is the justice in that? Where is the honour? Where is the principle? Where is the consistency, that some working in big corporates and the public sector can get a benefit that Labor wants to deny to those people who are operating in the small business economy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is simply unjust to take that inequitable position, and that is why we have moved to implement a scheme that is perfect for small business: available to their workplaces and to those who are juggling the tasks of economic goals for themselves and their families, and also raising that family. For the first time, small businesses will be able to operate on a level playing field with the public sector and large businesses when it comes to offering those employment benefits to be able attract and recruit the very best people for their businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about equity. It is about participation; encouraging people to see that there is a pathway to juggling those crucial dual objectives of economic wellbeing and prospects for a family. It is also being funded in a way that is fair and just. We took to the last election a 1½ per cent reduction in the company tax rate. Now, I know that only one-third of small businesses are actually structured as companies so for that 800,000 that is some promise of an encouragement and an incentive to grow and to be profitable in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not funded by the small companies. This is funded by the most profitable companies, which will not have that 1½ per cent company tax cut reduction within the window we have announced as a policy. This is really important; it is a measure that is funded in a sustainable way and it is a measure that is available to small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would love to talk about the root-and-branch review, but there is so much to talk about! The root-and-branch review is something that Labor would not go near. They are happy to snarl and snigger and carry on about the problems but do nothing about it. Why? Because they only talk to big business and big unions, and this is about giving efficient businesses, big and small, a fair go, and I hope that I get the chance to speak further— <span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  Actually, in answer to a question that the minister asked: we have asked lots and lots of questions on small business, and related to small business. We have just asked people who might be able to give us an answer! That is the only difference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is no doubt that the budget is having an immediate impact on the Australian economy and hence small business in Australia. The latest Westpac index of consumer confidence, in fact, shows the results of surveys taken after the Abbott government's budget; it fell sharply by 6.8 per cent in May. Perhaps the minister would like to explain why that is the case, since they are supposed to be the doyens of all knowledge and assistance for small business. Perhaps he could also explain why almost 60 per cent of the respondents in the Westpac survey said that the budget would make it tougher on family finances in the next 12 months and hence make it tough on small business as well?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ANZ-Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence survey showed that following the Abbott government's budget, consumer confidence had fallen 14 per cent since April. That is the fastest rate since the financial crisis. Now, that is pretty telling. And weekend reports from property analysts show sharp falls are being felt in the economy, with house prices in Australia's capital cities falling for the first time in 12 months. The RP Data index suggests that there is a strong correlation between consumer confidence levels and housing market activity, again, as a result of the very bad and chaotic budget of the Abbott government. So consumer confidence is falling—that is confirmed. And it is not Labor saying that, that is independent analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the Minister for Small Business makes massive cuts in the budget—directly cuts funding for small business. He cuts funding for skills and training programs which, as the minister would know himself, are one of the big issues for small business. That comes up in every survey and every time you talk to small business. They want funding for skills and training programs. The minister cuts what small business needs the most. He also has cut billions from tax benefits directly for small business and then tries to blame somebody else. If his cuts then have an effect on jobs, he tries to find somebody else to blame. It could not possibly be all the cuts that this minister and the Abbott government have made. When is the government actually going to take some responsibility rather than just look pious?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are approximately 2.1 million small businesses in Australia employing roughly five million Australians. There are figures we all know, but these are figures that very few understand—perhaps even this minister knows the data but just does not understand what it means. On Labor's watch, we were quite happy to acknowledge the data and the circumstances. I felt proud that we created the conditions for small business to grow—because in fact, that is exactly what happened—based on estimates of employment by business size and the changes in the number of people employed between 2007 and 2013. I think the minister is slightly aware of this. Maybe he should try to explain this, because I am using the same dataset he likes to use. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps he could try to explain why large business—they are business too—grew from around 2.6 million to 3.4 million under Labor's watch. Just an explanation: how is that possible? That is 757,000 additional people, 757,000 additional jobs, which is an annual percentage increase of 4.3 per cent. Once he tries to explain that, he might perhaps try to explain further how medium and small businesses grew from around 1.9 million up to 2.7 million. That is an increase of additional people, real people, new jobs, real jobs—822,000. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then he could probably try to explain this—and this is the figure he likes the most; the one he likes to quote. But he does not quite tell people this: non-employing business saw an annual change over that period, a transfer, albeit small. It is only 1.8 per cent over a six-year period. That is quite small. But it is the figure that the minister likes to quote, the 519,000 jobs. But, funnily enough, it is only in the non-employing small business. Where did those so-called jobs—because if they are not employing anyone you are assuming it is just the person who is the business, non-employing as the data shows—go? They went to medium and small business. Isn't that what it should always be about? Isn't that what we all want? Don't we want non-employing business to employ someone? Don't we want them to get out of that category and move up to the next category and grow? Because that is what Labor did: grow jobs and business.</span>

I am happy to help him with his understanding of the figures. I know there is probably not really any authoritative voice amongst his colleagues who could explain these figures to him. But I am happy to do that, because I am always happy to provide good service wherever I am able to. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He talked about the changing employment numbers and sought to extract certain elements of that ABS table that did not suit his argument. It is quite simple. If you carve out bits that are unhelpful, you will probably get a different answer to the ones that reasonably depict the livelihoods that are available within small businesses employing 19 and under people. That is what the ABS data says. That ABS data, including all those that fall within the small business category, will be microbusiness, home based businesses, all important businesses, and it includes self-employment and non-employing businesses. There is nothing wrong with that. We think there is nothing wrong with people who choose their own pathway to achieve a livelihood. We know Labor has a different view. That is why you have seen this coordinated attack on independent contractors and self-employed people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is borne out by the question today. He does not even want to talk about non-employing businesses. A non-employing business is still a livelihood, and a livelihood matters. A livelihood in a small business matters, even if it is not employing somebody and is a sole operator. We do not need to be reminded by Labor how indifferent they are to those courageous men and women who mortgage their houses, who take risks to create opportunities for themselves. You just brush them away as if they do not count. A non-employing small business matters. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a stack more of them before you guys got into office. There are so many fewer of them now. We are still seeing a recovery—which is needed—now that you have gone, because there is now confidence that the government are on the side of small-business men and women, that we are an ally, that we are an advocate. We are not an adversary like you guys were. Five hundred and nineteen thousand jobs were lost in small business. That is 519,000 livelihoods. If you want to carve them off and say that because they are not employing somebody they do not count, shame on you. Shame on you! Do not come into this place masquerading as if you care when you have such a disdain for people who are running their own business but happen not to be employing anybody.</span>

That is what is different about the coalition, the Liberal-National parties. Labor say: 'If you're self-employed or you're a small business and you don't employ anybody, you don't matter. We'll just take you off the data. We'll just not even think about you, and we'll concoct another piece of fiction like the budgets to try and argue a narrow, hollow, self-serving case'—which ignores the very interests of people who deserved a whole lot more respect from Labor when the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government were in office. If they have learnt nothing, we just saw evidence of it today. They have still learnt nothing. Show a bit of respect for those people who mortgage their houses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member did not care to talk about the extra 200,000 people who were added to the unemployment lists under Labor. He chose not to talk about those. He chose not to go to the insolvency numbers that are there. He chose not to go to business formation numbers. He chose to cherry-pick some of the consumer surveys that are out there and the confidence surveys—where the message coming back to me time and time again is that people are less troubled by the facts of the budget when the facts are shared with them. What some of those sentiment indexes are reflecting is the shrill, over-the-top, scaremongering of Labor, who, through their actions and their dishonesty, are ripping out of people's livelihoods and their plans for the future the confidence and optimism that we are focused, every day, on building for them so that we have a strong and prosperous economy, so that people can be safe and secure about their future prospects, so that those small businesses not employing—so disdained by Labor—might choose to become an employing small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we have made changes in the area of Fair Work, to provide some guidance and support tools for that non-employing small business to encourage them and assist them to make that decision about a new recruitment. There is a direct helpline in to Fair Work. It is not like Labor's, where you used to disclose the facts of your case and they reserved the right to prosecute you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are some of the practical measures that are part of our comprehensive plan to restore the jobs lost in the small-business economy under Labor, to rebuild confidence and optimism about the prospects into the future. I say to every small business, every family enterprise, even those that are non-employing and disdained by Labor: you all matter. You are valued and respected by the coalition. You are the engine room of the economy. We know that Labor took a cylinder or two out of the engine. We want to get that performance back because it is crucial to our future prospects.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I would like to address some issues to the Minister for Small Business and thank him for recently visiting the electorate of Swan on two occasions to talk to small businesses and a business incubation group down in Kensington. I know that the member for Oxley was also in Swan not long ago representing that Labor were actually interested in businesses. As someone who has been in small business since 1981 and has been through the period of both Labor and Liberal governments, I know that Labor are no friend of small business—never have been, never will be. They just do not get it. They stand up there all time saying, 'We're the friends of small business.' What an absolute joke.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 30 years I have been in business, it has been very plain to anyone in small business. No-one I know in the small business association stands up and says: 'Give us a Labor government. We want a Labor government for small business.' Who says that? The Labor Party says it. The unions say it. But it is certainly not said by businesses. Businesses do not say, 'We want a Labor government,' I can tell you. We only need to look at the royal commission. That gives you a perfect example of how unions and the Labor Party treat small businesses. That is all the stuff that is coming out now. They had Western Australia. I know there were times in Western Australia in the construction industry, where my background is, where many small businesses paid thousands and thousands of dollars to unions and to ALP fronts—even training fronts. That is coming out now, isn't it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Oxley mention training programs. There is one in Welshpool that for years has been taking money from small businesses. If you go there, there are no training programs, but they are still getting the money. They are still being paid by the small business people, who are blackmailed or put into situations where they are supposed to be paying for non-existent training programs. I know that small business has enormous compliance costs as well, so I will ask the minister—since we are running out of time—what real changes are being made by the coalition to assist small business?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  The measures being implemented by the Abbott government are so comprehensive that I will not have time to run through them all. But I am happy to go through many of the elements that are important to the member for Swan. He talked about skills training. Of course, there is the Industry Skills Fund, which is designed to provide particular support to meet the training needs of small businesses. We have the Entrepreneurs Infrastructure Fund, which is another important measure tailored and targeted for smaller enterprises, to help them bring their ideas to market and to collaborate with researchers. There are so many good measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are continuing our advisory service program. There are no cuts to that funding, in an important effort to better target those so that we get the help we need. There is also the issue of engagement with technology. We know how it can be for small businesses to be a part of the technology world to access new markets and opportunities. There is also support for exporters—a better targeting of the Export Market Development Grants facility. We are making sure that EFIC, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, has its systems geared to the needs of small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many things building possibilities, capacity and opportunities through the small business community. That is why we need to pass this budget. We need to fix the budget to strengthen the economy and to build a strong and prosperous economy that provides livelihoods and opportunities for a safe and secure future that supports small business and that re-energises enterprise. That is why I am thrilled to commend these budget measures to you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other measures that are available include improving small business access to contracts. One thing that Labor did was spend money like there was no tomorrow, but they did not actually give small business a fighting chance to win that work. Other important measures include the unfair contracts provisions and implementing franchising reforms—something that Labor would not touch. It was like kryptonite. They would not go near it until—what?—five minutes from the election, when all of a sudden they got interested. We are actually doing the work that is needed. I commend these budget measures and urge this parliament to get behind the implementation of our economic action strategy.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  It is a great pleasure to join my colleague, the member for Aston—the unnaturally handsome, member for Aston—and to follow the unnaturally talented member for Dunkley in what was a very persuasive and powerful defence of the changes that he has undertaken in his Small Business and Treasury portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here today not to defend a very good budget but to inform you about why the budget that has just been announced by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is in the best interests of the Australian people. This budget does two things. This budget, first and foremost, pays back Labor's debt—$667 billion of Labor's debt. That was the legacy of those opposite to the Australian people. Through measures in this budget, over the next 10 years we will reduce expenditure by nearly $300 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Rankin should know this, because he was part of a government that led to a record increase in government spending. We want to be part of a government that is much more responsible when it comes to budgetary measures. So we will save the Australian taxpayer up to $16 billion a year in the interest bill alone as a result of these measures—up to $16 billion a year. That is as much as a WestConnex project. That is as much as an East West Link. It is as much as an NDIS. It is as much as Gonski. That is just the interest bill we will save as a result of measures in this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing we will do as a result of this budget measures is lay a foundation for more jobs, higher growth and increased productivity. When it comes to those measures, first and foremost, there has been a record government expenditure on infrastructure: some $50 billion in new funding for infrastructure, which will in turn lead to up to $125 billion in state, private sector and federal government expenditure. This includes putting money on the table to incentivise the states to recycle their infrastructure. This is a record amount of government spending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing we will do is invest record amounts in education and innovation. The Medical Research Future Fund will be—and is already becoming, in terms of its ambitious proposal—the envy of the world: some $20 billion in funding for medical research, an area of natural expertise in Australia. We want to deregulate our university sector, a critical area, so that we can enable our universities to become the best in the world. We can do that by deregulation. We are giving apprentices, for the first time, significant government support just as if they were going to university. That is what we are doing in this budget in terms of education and innovation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth thing we are doing to boost growth, jobs and productivity is enhancing workforce participation. We are enhancing workforce participation by saying to people who are over the age of 50 and who have been on welfare for more than six months: we will give your employer up to $10,000 as an incentive to take you on board so that you no longer have to be on welfare. When it comes to women in the workforce, we want to encourage them to stay in the workforce after they have had children; a paid parental leave scheme is an important component of that. Australia is below other countries in the world when it comes to the number of women participating in our workforce. They are coming out of our universities in higher numbers than men but they are not represented in our workforce in the same numbers. Then, of course, there is our earn and learn strategy which is so important—because under the government of those opposite, under the Labor government, youth unemployment went to record levels. We are trying to break that nexus between welfare dependency and unemployment. What we are saying is: if you are a young person you must go out and find a job. We will help you do that. We will also give you training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a vitally important budget. In my areas of deregulation and the G20; cutting red tape and consolidating the number of bodies, we are making great headway. I commend the measures in this budget to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government was fair dinkum about participation, for example, they would not be attacking the childcare system. If they were fair dinkum about this so-called budget emergency they would not have doubled the deficit when they came into government. If they were serious about budget repair they would not be spending $21 billion on a scheme that gives the wealthiest mothers in the country the most money that they least need. There were all kinds of things in there, but I want to focus on the Federation as part of this portfolio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a couple of questions that I would like the parliamentary secretary to deal with. Firstly: they make a big deal in their budget documents about a functioning Federation and reform; they have a white paper coming and all the rest of it. It is very curious that they would abolish the COAG Reform Council. It is very curious that, when premiers right around the country are calling for a meeting to discuss the cuts to payments to states, there has been no meeting scheduled. I would like to know from the parliamentary secretary what is the plan for engaging with the premiers and state treasurers who are so critical of the budget. That is the first set of things I would like him to elaborate on. And then there are the cuts to the COAG Reform Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also very specifically would like him to refer to page 7 of their own budget overview document—and I am happy to provide a copy if the parliamentary secretary would like it. I would like him to confirm that my eyes are not deceiving me and that it says: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this Budget the Government is adopting sensible indexation arrangements for schools from 2018, and hospitals from 2017<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:MS Mincho;&#xD;&#xA;  ">-</span>18, and removing funding guarantees for public hospitals.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day in question time the Prime Minister denies this bit I have helpfully highlighted it in green for the benefit of the House. It says that there is $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals. I would like the parliamentary secretary very specifically to confirm that that is indeed the government's budget document and that that number is indeed true.</span>

Firstly, it is not only us who are telling the Australian people that we have to reduce spending; it is groups like the IMF, who said of 17 leading economies in the world Australia has the fastest rate of spending, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office and the independent Commission of Audit, who said that we are on a trajectory of spending that we cannot continue. That is why we have had to take measures in this budget. </span>

You need to know that the sunny state of Queensland is also going to be a beneficiary of the COAG Reform Council not continuing and the Commonwealth is going to save over $8 million.</span>

Yes, it is true that some of the state premiers and the chief ministers were not that happy after the budget, but would you believe that, if you look at Treasury's papers, over the coming decade increased expenditure from the Commonwealth to the states is going to be tens of billions of dollars—nearly $60 billion of increased money over the decade. That is money from the Commonwealth to the states for things like hospitals and schools. In fact, hospital funding and school funding are going up between 37 and 40 per cent.</span>

                    </a>  It is. Spending is going up over the next four years and the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated that in the chamber. If you look at the government's funding commitments for hospitals and schools, it is going up year upon year upon year—40 per cent and 37 per cent for schools and hospitals. The member for Rankin is very brave because he has raised the issue of school funding. What has been the most topical issue when it comes to school funding? It has been Gonski. How much more have we put in?</span>

In my state of Tasmania, government funding for state schools over the next five years goes up by 46 per cent. I do not know how we can translate that increase in funding as being a cut, as the member for Rankin tries to do. I know he is very fond of figures. I think he used to influence the abacus in the member for Swan's office over the last six years.</span>

How can he be proud of $667 billion of gross debt, and right now borrowing $1 billion every month just to pay the interest on the debt? If, like the member for Franklin, his abacus continued to borrow into the future, in 10 years time that would be $3 billion of borrowings every month to pay the interest on our debt.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. My question to the parliamentary secretary goes to the proliferation of bureaucratic structures and regulation under the former Labor government over the last six years. Despite promising to limit regulatory impacts—and I think Mr Rudd had a promise of 'one on, one off' when it came to regulation; in their cabinet submissions, every department was going to have a regulatory impact statement—somehow, we managed to end up with 21,000 new pieces of legislation and regulation. That is 21,000—so much for another promise to the Australian people that was not met by those opposite over the last six years. The people in my electorate have conveyed that as being a little bit like a 1,200 kilometre screwdriver from Canberra.</span>

                    </a>  The people in my electorate described it as something like a 1,200 kilometre screwdriver from Canberra tinkering and adjusting but, in essence, interfering with their daily lives. Businesses and community groups felt that pressure, that pressure of 21,000 pieces of regulation, every day. Where the proponents for projects were confronted with an environmental issue, they felt the full wrath of all three levels of government, including the government in Canberra when it came to OH&amp;S and environmental problems and a whole range of other issues. Unions and green groups, not surprisingly, had all this disproportionate influence in Canberra. Regrettably, in Tasmania we had the double whammy of Labor-Greens government in Hobart as well.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know people often talk about business power, and I know the member for Rankin and those opposite engage in the politics of envy and division. But the greatest power of business is the power to invest or disinvest. What stops them from investing are those obstacles and those roadblocks. What we are doing as a government is eliminating some of those obstacles and roadblocks. I am the Tasmanian representative on the parliamentary secretary's deregulation committee, which has done some extraordinarily good work, and I was a proud member of the first repeal day. I hope there are many more to roll back some of the injudicious regulation that came out of those opposite. We sent a powerful message about our government's commitment when it comes to easing that burden of legislation and regulation. Those were the obstacles to investment I was referring to earlier. In that context, I ask the parliamentary secretary: what more does this budget foreshadow when it comes to deregulation and getting rid of the proliferation of the many hundreds of government bodies and rent seekers out there that grew during the last six years? Are there even more savings to be made in this regard in the future?</span>

He is right. They left us 21,000 additional regulations. He referred to regulatory impact statements. Those opposite promised that there would be regulatory impact statements for major legislative initiatives. Would the members opposite believe that, when it came to the carbon tax, the mining tax, changes to the Fair Work Act, the NBN and the Future of Financial Advice, each of those legislative initiatives was exempt from a regulatory impact statement process? Those opposite have no idea as to the true impact and cost on stakeholders of those thousands of new regulations that they introduced by way of the heavy hand of government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to be very different from that. We have already had our first repeal day, where we were successful in getting rid of more than 10,000 additional regulations and redundant pieces of legislation. The savings to the Australian taxpayer and to industry is more than $700 million. We are not finished. I thank the members for Bass Hindmarsh, Deakin, Wright, Aston and Herbert for their incredibly hard work in putting ideas on the table for cutting red and green tape across the economy. One of the real areas in which we have been successful has been environmental approvals. The Minister for the Environment has given approval for more than $500 billion worth of projects in the just less than nine months that we have been in office, and we have moved to one-stop shop environmental approvals.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bass asked an important question about the consolidation of agencies in this budget. I am very pleased to report that, as a result of measures in this budget, hundreds of millions of dollars will be saved to the taxpayer by unwinding the layer upon layer of bureaucracy that currently exists. In fact, the Commission of Audit found that the Commonwealth government had about 1,000 statutory and non-statutory bodies within its remit. What we have said is we are going to get rid of some of these bodies. Let me tell you the names of some of these bodies we are going get rid of. We are going to get rid of the Advisory Panel on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula. We are going to get rid of the Social Inclusion Board and the High Speed Rail Advisory Group. The process is well underway for merging AusAID with the Department of Foreign Affairs. Of course, when we are providing support for good governance, health, education and infrastructure in our region, it needs to be linked with our diplomats. It is just a common-sense idea where we will save a huge amount of money. We are merging the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service into the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The functions of Health Workforce Australia, General Practice Education and Training Ltd and the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will go into the Department of Health. The back office functions for the National Archives, the National Gallery, the National Museum, the National Library and the National Portrait Gallery are all going to be merged because that brings savings to the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can go on. We are merging five civilian merit review tribunals into a single organisation—so the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Classification Review Board, the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal will come together—not to mention the very busy privatisation agenda that we have currently underway with Medibank Private, and we have announced scoping studies into the sale of Defence Housing Australia, the Royal Australian Mint, Australian Hearing and the registry function of ASIC. It is very important to understand what the government should be doing and what the private sector should be doing and having a proper delineation of responsibilities so in the end we can provide better service to the taxpayer at less cost.</span>

One of the things I want to talk about is the notion that, if you cannot slash an advisory body or get rid of an expert, then you can always just ignore it, like we are ignoring the Office for Women. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Abbott's budget of broken promises makes savage cuts to pensions. We have been there. We know the list of cuts is long: hospitals, family payments, superannuation, education and services. All of these cuts will have a deep impact on women. For example, a single parent on the parenting payment, the majority of whom are women, will have their budgets hit by more than $3,400 a year. Industry Super Australia has stated: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the aftermath of the budget, we have seen an unprecedented and dishonest attack on Australia's carers, the majority of whom are women. There are no changes to carers as a result of the budget, the Prime Minister said in question time on 16 June. This is wrong. The budget cuts the carers payment, with indexation to be reduced to CPI. This will impact on carers, the majority of whom are women. And, with women accounting for 60 per cent of GP visits, the GP tax will have a deep impact on their access to health care. As the costs mount for families, tough decisions will be made on seeking help for those families.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During Senate estimates, on 27 May, it was confirmed that the Office for Women, in your department of PM&amp;C, provided advice on all relevant measures leading up to the budget. Ms McDevitt said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For all the budget measures, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provides advice, and, since the Office for Women is located within the department, the Office for Women has provided advice on relevant measures leading up to the budget, which could include consulting with other agencies and providing internal advice that would feed into the whole-of-department advice on budget measures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My question in this area is: why was advice from the Prime Minister's own department ignored in the formulation of the budget? It has been the practice, for over 30 years, for federal governments to produce a women's budget statement as one element of the official budget papers. We heard a few minutes ago lots of statements, pointing the finger across the chamber about previous budgets—not the budget of 2014, which is the budget we are all here to talk about. That has been in place for 30 years in the official budget papers, but in 2014 it is not included.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />My question is, given the PM is the Minister for Women and the Office for Women is in PM&amp;C, who made the decision to cut this statement? Was the Office for Women consulted on this specific decision? Given the impact on women of this budget, why was this decision made? And I will go further, with another question. To me, as a woman, it is really concerning that this government has a mirror looking backwards. I am looking forward to doing my ironing again. I wonder if you can answer that.<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a>  Off the record or on the record, I am an extremely strong supporter of the Paid Parental Leave scheme because I believe it boosts workforce participation. The member for Rankin is showing great ignorance because he probably does not know that the Grattan Institute put out a report on the numbers of women who are in the Australian workforce compared to the number of men. Those numbers are 67 per cent of women, compared with 78 per cent of men. Of those 67 per cent of women in the workforce, how many do you think are working full time? Only 55 per cent. But when you look at the number of men who are working full time, it is 85 per cent. One of the key things we need to do in this budget to support working women is institute a paid parental leave scheme and I am a big supporter of the Prime Minister's scheme.</span>

I am very happy to tell those opposite. Firstly, the National Women's Alliances program has received funding of almost $4.8 million for six alliances over the three years to 2016, up from just $3.6 million over the previous three years. Funding for the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children remains unchanged in this budget and that funding is $104 million over the forward estimates. This includes money for Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety, the Foundation to Prevent Violence Against Women and their Children, 1800 RESPECT, DvaleRT—domestic violence response training delivered nationally by Lifeline—and the personal safety survey and—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  I was going to put this in halves, but I am happy for Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg to take this on notice. I do have a question for Parliamentary Secretary Tudge as well. In relation to the red tape reduction, is there a possibility that we will make this a COAG process? The work we have done on red tape and green tape reduction has been fantastic. It is a great start. The commitment to keep going is important. I see the member for Wright is here. His previous occupation was a truck driver. Most of his red tape costs would have been state government costs. My big concern here is the possibility of cost shifting or responsibility shifting to the states. If we save $1 billion then the states put on $500 million of red tape, we would still be $500 million better off but the states would have jumped in. I would like to see if you are going to follow that through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My second question for Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg is on the tender process. I will give an example. The Flinders Shire Council had a nine-kilometre stretch of road that they costed at $9 million. Because it was over the threshold it had to go to national tender. It was picked up by a national supplier and the cost was $27 million. They flew in their team, equipment and camp and did the work and nothing went through the local community. Is it possible that we can look at something in relation to the tender process to ensure that the money that is expended by the Commonwealth in regional and regional communities does stay there and we give more flexibility to local councils in that area?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent the seat of Herbert, which includes Palm Island. We have a number of Indigenous organisations. I have a real issue when it comes to the running of some of these Indigenous organisations. Lack of accountability and poor governance have meant massive losses of funds. People have been shifted out of these organisations. Information on what we believe were fraud matters has been provided to the police. It is very hard for the police to prove fraud. Is there an instrument in ORIC—and will the parliamentary secretary take it upon himself to have a look at the rules of ORIC—that is similar to ASIC's rule that someone is no longer fit and proper to run an organisation, so we can make sure that the governance to the community is better off?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, would the parliamentary secretary be able to advise me about the opportunities to work and get a decent job. I know he is very passionate in this regard. Palm Island is 2½ hours on the ferry, so the 90-minute rule no longer applies. If someone is moving to Palm Island, there is no onus on them to look for a job. The difference between being on benefits and working can quite often be a disincentive to them getting a job. Can the parliamentary secretary give me some information in relation to what he is thinking about this and what the government is thinking in this space?</span>

                    <a href="FKL" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FRYDENBERG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:38</span>):  I thank the member for Herbert for those important questions. I will leave the questions in the Indigenous space to my colleague the member for Aston. The member for Herbert is absolutely right: this is not just a whole-of-government approach to deregulation at the federal level but also very much involving the states. The Prime Minister has said that deregulation will become a standing item on the agenda at COAG, which will be used as the primary body for driving reform at the federal and state levels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last COAG meeting in the first week of May they all discussed deregulation in relation to a number of areas. Those areas included housing and commercial building construction; road freight; food and dairy manufacturing and fish processing; tourism business licensing—which will be very important in your electorate of Herbert, particularly around Townsville; rules as they relate to cafes and restaurants; and gas and resources exploration. They have divided up these areas among the various states for them to take responsibility for doing a deep dive in the particular area and bringing forward ideas where there is federal-state overlap in regulation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very determined that, to be successful on the deregulation front, we not only get changes done at the federal level but drive changes at the state level so that, as the member for Herbert mentioned, the states do not just introduce new regulations to make up for the federal government's reduction in regulations. You need to understand that we are extremely focused on this. A number of states like Victoria have a red tape commissioner and they are driving changes. I have met with Deb Frecklington, the assistant minister for finance with responsibility for deregulation in Queensland, your home state. We are driving this agenda forward together. As the member for Herbert rightly mentioned, in the area of environmental approvals we were able to get MOUs signed with every state and territory. Those opposite would like to know that the Labor state of South Australia and the ACT also signed on to these MOUs and Greg Hunt has been moving forward to get full agreements, particularly with Queensland and New South Wales, in a speedy fashion. So we are moving at a state and a federal level on the deregulation agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Herbert also raised the very important issue of trying to create jobs at a local level through the tendering process. The member for Herbert may be interested to know that one area we have been looking at relates to the federal safety commission because the federal safety commissioner requires, under the legislation, that builders be particularly accredited. What can happen is if Defence Housing is building in remote areas, as it often does, it would want to source builders from the local area, but those local builders may not have the accreditation needed to get that job because going through that accreditation process requires extra costs on their part. That is another example of where those opposite have no understanding of the true impact on job creation at the local level of extra layers of bureaucracy and red tape. So I have met the head of Defence Housing and we are looking at this issue of the federal safety commissioner. Hopefully I will be able to report to the member for Herbert that there has been some progress on this issue. Like him, all my colleagues on this side of the House understand that we need to create jobs in the regions, we need to free up the councils, we need to free up the local builders and we need to ensure that they can get a personal dividend out of our red tape reduction efforts.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  We have seen a fair bit of rhetoric this morning, as we always do in sessions of this kind, and a bit of cut and thrust. That is all well and good, but I seek the indulgence of the parliamentary secretary to ask a question of earnest importance, and that is a question dealing with the incidence of men's violence against women in our community. I ask him to take this question from me as one man asking another man about an important issue that all men should be speaking out about in our community. Questions that go to the prioritisation of funding are inherently political, but I emphasise I am not asking partisan questions as I do not doubt the intent of those opposite to curb the growth of men's violence against women in our community and, in fact, to drive the rate of violence down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My questions relate to two areas of funding and the Office for Women. I am seeking guidance from the parliamentary secretary about whether the Office for Women provided advice to the government on how this year's budget would impact on services provided to women in danger of family violence, in particular in the area of community legal centres. We have seen $1.6 million cut in the budget from the women's leadership and development strategy, which includes the Australian Women Against Violence Alliance, but also $15 million from legal aid and millions from community legal centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Melbourne's west, in my electorate, more than 50 per cent of the work of community legal centres is advising women in danger of family of violence. For the benefit of people who have not engaged with these groups, this kind of advice includes their rights in the legal system, protection and their rights to intervention orders to ensure their safety. It is also advice about what to expect if they make the decision to leave their home, in terms of their financial security, the obligation of the government to them and the obligation of their partners to support them. Also, there has been a 35 per cent increase in demand for community legal centre advice in this space in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">MYEFO contained cuts of $3.6 million from the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services, $9.6 million from community legal centres and $6.5 million from legal aid. Did the Office for Women provide advice to the government about the impact of those cuts on women in these situations? Also, did they take into account that the rising rates of domestic violence increase demand for these services in the community? If they did provide advice, I would ask what the recommendations of that advice were and whether it was acted on by the government?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area I would like to ask about is the impact of cuts to Medicare Locals funding contained in this year's budget, and the impact this has on family violence services. Family violence was a priority area for the Medicare Local in my community. As I said, family violence is an extraordinarily serious and growing problem in my community. These cuts will have substantial impact on the ability of Medicare Local-funded programs to continue in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should emphasise that these are not cuts to the Medicare Local institutions, these are cuts to the funding of programs being implemented by Medicare Locals. Again, I ask whether the Office for Women provided advice on these decisions and about the impact of these decisions on women in these situations? I ask whether the cumulative impact of these cuts to programs that assist GPs in providing advice to women and identifying women in these situations, combined with cuts to community legal centres, who are providing advice to women in these situations, were taken into account in the budget process?</span>

Like him, I hail from the state of Victoria, which has been rocked by tragedy in recent times, particularly as it relates to violence against women. The Jill Meagher case is the most prominent example of what is clearly unacceptable behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, this budget continues to strongly support funding programs to prevent violence against women. On the issue of the Office for Women and the advice that they are able to provide: that is done within the context of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. They are able to provide advice on all relevant measures in this budget. We take our advice from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the particular measures that we are committed to in this budget: as I said earlier, the funding for the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children remains unchanged. The funding for this plan is $104 million over the forward estimates and the budget continues funding for the Australian National Research Organisation For Women's Safety and the Foundation to Prevent Violence Against Women and their Children, as well as a number of other measures including 1800Respect, the nationally funded counselling support line for women experiencing sexual assault and/or domestic violence; DV-aleRT, Domestic Violence Response Training delivered nationally by Lifeline; the Personal Safety Survey; and the National Community Attitudes Survey to Violence Against Women. The second action plan, which will include our commitment and that of the states and the territories to ongoing action, will be released mid this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member opposite asked me about community legal centres and funding for those. We continue to believe that funding going forward needs to be structured in a way which does take into account the most vulnerable in our community including women at risk. We have extended the base funding under the national partnership agreement on legal assistance services by one year until 30 June 2015. Ongoing future legal assistance will be the subject of consideration, and the findings of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into access to justice arrangements and the recent review of the national partnerships agreement will also inform future decisions going forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to Medicare Locals, the member opposite will be aware that we have increased funding for health in this budget right across the board. In fact, funding for hospitals has increased by nearly 40 per cent over the coming years. There are a lot of fallacies contained in the arguments put by those opposite. We have put more money into education than they ever did—including $1.2 billion for the Gonski proposals—and we have continued to promote funding for hospitals and front-line patient services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud of this budget because it pays back debt, it boosts jobs growth and productivity, and it continues to provide financial support, assistance and services for those most in need.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I firstly make the observation that this is the very first time in Australian political history that we are discussing the Indigenous Affairs budget as part of the consideration of the Prime Minister and Cabinet budget. That is because Prime Minister Abbott is now the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs. It is the first time in Australian political history that that has been done, and he has done so because he saw the importance of this area and wanted to oversee the entire portfolio area himself. The questions that will come up now will also come up when we are discussing the Prime Minister and Cabinet budget. I think that is worth reflecting upon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not in my opening remarks go through the specific measures which are outlined in the budget. They are tabled for the members here to see. What I would like to do, though, is inform members as to the overall approach that we are taking in the Indigenous Affairs portfolio, the rationale for that approach, and, through that, how the budget is actually delivering on that approach. We have a great many challenges in this nation—and the member for Kooyong outlined some of the budgetary challenges which we are facing—but the greatest challenge in Australia remains the plight of Indigenous people. We ask all members to ensure that this is high on our political agenda at all times—and with the Prime Minister taking on the portfolio it hopefully will remain high on the political agenda at all times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our overall approach can be summarised by saying that we have three core priorities in the Indigenous area, and they sit on a bed of governance reforms. Those priorities are to get kids to school, to get the adults into work and to ensure that there are safe communities. And then there are a series of governance reforms which underpin that, and on the side we have the constitutional recognition process underway. I will touch on each of those three priorities briefly, as well as the governance changes. First of all, why those priorities—why education, employment and community? In part, it is because of the upstream factors. If kids are at school, if the adults are in work and you have reasonable order in a community, then the other things tend to take care of themselves. People's mental health is better and people's physical health is better. If people are in work and kids are in school, then child protection tends to be better. If there is a safe community, then you do not need as many activities overall in terms of policing and other such activities. So it is a firm focus on the things which we think absolutely matter for the overall functioning of any society, frankly, not just the Indigenous community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when you look at those three areas, there are significant problems at present. Take school attendance, for example. The school attendance rate across Australia for Indigenous is about 10 percentage points lower than for the non-Indigenous. But that hides what is occurring in the remote areas where there is sometimes what I would consider a catastrophic Indigenous attendance rate. In remote Northern Territory, for example, only about 25 per cent of students attend 80 per cent of the time. If you are attending less than 80 per cent of the time, you are effectively not learning. There are only about 25 per cent of students, therefore, that I would consider learning by virtue of attending school for a sufficient amount of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at employment, the employment gap is about 30 percentage points. The overall employment rate for non-Indigenous people is about 75 per cent and about 25 per cent for Indigenous per cent, and gap has in fact got wider over the last five years rather than smaller. When you look at community safety, the stats across the board are poorer in Indigenous communities than in non-Indigenous communities. So we do need to have a dedicated focus on those three areas, and this budget consolidates programs to ensure that we can have that focus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also has important governance reforms, primarily, by amalgamating 150 programs into five broad ones and ensuring that we can have much more localised and nuanced decisions made at a local level where Indigenous people can be more empowered. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I assume the parliamentary secretary is aware of a functions role and responsibility for the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council, having worked closely with the council. Mr Warren Mundine is the appointed and remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council which provides advice to and works with the government to implement Indigenous policy. When it comes to the council, I would like the parliamentary secretary to outline the budgeted remuneration levels of each member of the council. How much is Mr Mundine being paid? What are the levels of remuneration and the details of that remuneration, and those for his deputy chair and, of course, each member of the council? Could the parliamentary secretary outline the total cost to the budget of the operation of the Indigenous Advisory Council for the 2014-15 financial year as well as across the forward estimates? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous Advisory Council is responsible for the provision of Indigenous policy to the government. Did the council support the $534.4 million cut to Indigenous programs in the budget? Can the parliamentary secretary advise how and when the council was consulted about the budget measures in the 2014-15 budget round? How many times did the council meet before the budget and with which members of the government? Was the council consulted and did the council provide advice on all the budget measures? If not, can the parliamentary secretary explain why not? </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can the parliamentary secretary advise the chamber how often the Indigenous Advisory Council meets? Is every member present at every meeting? What are the quorum requirements for the council? Can the parliamentary secretary confirm that Mr Mundine has met with the members of the government on behalf of the Indigenous Advisory Council? When was the last time the council met and when will they meet next? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the appointed remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council, Mr Mundine is reported in the media as having announced a second round of cuts in Indigenous affairs program in the order of $600 million. Mr Mundine announced as the head of the Indigenous Advisory Council that he is meeting with the Treasurer Joe Hockey and finance minister Mathias Cormann to cut an additional $600 million from the Indigenous affairs budget. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm whether the $600 million in cuts mentioned by Mr Mundine is in the forward estimates? Did Mr Mundine meet with the Treasurer and finance minister before or after the budget was handed down? Who within the government authorised the new funding cuts? Does the government agree with and stand by the appointed and remunerated head of the Indigenous Advisory Council about the second wave of cuts? Are you working on or have you got more cuts in the forward estimates? Given the current level of $534 million is not able to be achieved through administrative efficiencies, is it being called from programs and where is the next round of cuts coming from? Why are further cuts being discussed within the government when the full impact of the current round of cuts is not yet known?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like the parliamentary secretary to talk about the modelling. What is the modelling Mr Mundine has referred to, why was it undertaken and what else did it reveal? Will he reveal the modelling? What was the scope of the modelling and has the modelling been authorised? If so, by what authority has the work been undertaken? Or is Mr Mundine effectively operating as the unelected minister for Indigenous affairs?</span>

                    </a>  I outlined in my opening remarks some of the significant issues which confront Indigenous Australia. I talked about the appalling attendance rates, where only a quarter of remote Indigenous students in the Northern Territory are attending at a rate which would even make it possible for them to advance and to learn at a reasonable level. I referred to the fact that the Indigenous employment rate is 30 per cent below the non-Indigenous employment rate, and the gap is actually widening. I could have gone on to mention all sorts of other statistics in relation to how Indigenous people are tracking against non-Indigenous people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I frankly find it surprising that, despite all of those issues, the first 60 questions from the shadow spokesperson for Indigenous affairs are almost entirely centred on Warren Mundine and what he is getting paid, what he is doing, which meetings he is having. I know Warren Mundine was a former president of the Australian Labor Party, and the fact that he is now chairing the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council should not cloud the types of decisions, questions and advocacy which the shadow spokesperson for Indigenous affairs engages in in this chamber and indeed in his role. I would encourage him to focus on the big picture, to focus on the issues which are facing Aboriginal people today and the issues which are faced in this budget, rather than being entirely focused on the activities of Warren Mundine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say, though, about the chair of our Indigenous advisory council and indeed the Indigenous advisory council more broadly that it is an outstanding advisory council. Members would be aware of who the chair is—Mr Mundine—and his activities over decades now, advocating on behalf of Aboriginal people. They would be aware of the other members of the Indigenous advisory council: Ngiare Brown; Mr Peever, the former CEO of Rio Tinto; and Gail Kelly. We have other very substantial Indigenous leaders who are providing advice to the Prime Minister and to the government as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their role is an advisory role. Their terms of reference and their role is outlined on the website. Mr Neumann can look at that website and understand that. He can understand when they are meeting. The Indigenous advisory council puts out a communique after each meeting, and so he can understand what their function and what their role is, but it is an advisory role. At the end of the day, decisions are made by the government and we accept responsibility for those decisions, but of course we consult with the Indigenous advisory council before making those decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the overall cost of running the Indigenous advisory council, I understand that those questions were asked in the Senate estimates process. I have been informed that that information will be provided through the Senate estimates process in due course. Of course, it will be a very small amount compared to the overall $4.8 billion which this government is investing in Indigenous specific programs over the next four years—$4.8 billion. I would suspect that the costs of the operation of the Indigenous advisory council will be a very, very small fraction of that $4.8 billion. That information, in detail, will be provided to the Senate and will therefore be publicly accessible to Mr Neumann, who has been asking these 60 questions in his four minutes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the overall budget, I outlined some of those measures in my opening statement. Yes, we have made some savings but we are still investing $4.8 billion over the forward estimates. And we have consolidated 150 programs into five. When you do that you can eliminate red tape and duplications and you can make administrative savings. That is exactly the intent of our budget. Our intention is to provide greater focus on the core areas of employment, school attendance and community safety and, of course, it is to provide efficiencies where we can do so.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms PRICE:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you. Maybe I will improve it; maybe I will lower it, but let's hope I can get some attention. My question is to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and it relates to how the Abbott government is working to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous school attendance rates. But first I would like to provide some context to this, particularly with respect to my electorate of Durack.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the parliamentary secretary and I know, to get ahead in life children and young adults need to build a strong foundation through our education system. To achieve this, however, we must first get children and young adults to school. The Durack electorate has the third highest proportion of Indigenous students. So, ensuring the education gap is significantly reduced in the short term, and rates of attendance are equal in the long term, is a key priority of mine. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in Durack Indigenous students attending school is not the norm; it is the rarity. Often this is due to dysfunction in students' home lives. Lack of structure and discipline leads to a high prevalence of truancy. In Fitzroy, Derby and Wiluna, in particular, a significantly higher level of truancy has already been identified by this government and the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, which highlights non-attendance cycles in schools. This authority identified that the average annual attendance rates of students attending Fitzroy Valley District High School between 2008 and 2013 was only 62 per cent. This rate was marginally better at the Derby District High School, with 69 per cent, and there was 65 per cent attendance at the Wiluna Remote Community School. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What these schools have in common is that they are all remote and have large Indigenous populations, which are often transient. However, this non-attendance cycle was also identified at the Carnarvon Community College—a school which is located in a much higher regional hub—which had an attendance rate of 68 per cent in 2012. I am also saddened that the Roebourne District High School in the Pilbara region had one of the worst attendance rates in the country, of 53 per cent in the same year. This government and the wider Australian community have an expectation that every child has access to, and attends, school every day. But we need to work collaboratively to achieve this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I do have some good news. Despite these concerning statistics, I am pleased to say that in Broome, which is a key regional centre in Durack, with a high number of Indigenous students, there are many success stories in the education sphere. I have previously acknowledged the success of the Broome Senior High School and its principal Saeed Amin and his staff, whose hard work and dedication, saw this school become the WA School of the Year in the year 2012. In the same year, the school had a 100 per cent success rate for university offers for those students who were studying university courses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another success story is the local TAFE in the Kimberley, which is called the Kimberley Training Institute or KTI. KTI is the leading vocational education and training provider in the Kimberley region, which runs courses out of Broome and Kununurra. It aims to provide the skills and knowledge students need to enhance their employment opportunities. The fantastic work of KTI was recognised last year, when it received two major accolades at the WA training awards. Visual arts lecturer Jacky Cheng was awarded Best Trainer in Western Australia, while the KTI was awarded Best Large Training Provider. I commend all staff and students for this significant achievement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is therefore clear that all students in Durack, no matter their age, race or social status, have the ability to access high-quality education through our schools and service providers. We just need to get these kids to school. This leads me to my question: can the parliamentary secretary please outline the government's approach for improving Indigenous attendance rates at schools across Australia and, in particular, in regional and remote areas?</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  I thank the member for Durack for this question on what is a critical area. I commend her for her commitments to her constituency and her electorate, but more broadly to Aboriginal people across Australia. I know she has a very passionate commitment in wanting to see the advancement of Aboriginal people and wanting to see the gap closed in this country. I commend her for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question she raises is a critically important one. It concerns school attendance and education attainment. As I said at the outset, this is our top priority in the Indigenous affairs portfolio and, therefore, one of the top priorities for the government is to lift the school attendance rate. If children are not at school then, by definition, they are not going to be learning. If they are not learning at school, it is so much harder to get employment afterwards and it is likely to lead to a life of welfare. It starts with school attendance. At the moment the school attendance rates, particularly in remote areas, as the member for Durack outlined, are sometimes at catastrophic levels. In some schools, the attendance rate is as low as 37 per cent. If you actually looked at what I think is the most important measure in this area, that of how many kids are attending at least 80 per cent of the time, that figure is even smaller. It is a very significant problem. We do not underestimate the challenge which we have to support schools, to support the Indigenous leaders and to support children to be able to go to school and to learn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To date, the most important measure that we have introduced to tackle school attendance, particularly in remote areas, is the Remote School Attendance Strategy. In simple terms, that means providing employment opportunities for local, quality people to act as attendance officers. In the mornings they go around, knock on the doors, encourage the families to get their young son or daughter onto the minibus to take them to school, ensure that they are at school during the day and encourage those children to get home safely at the end of the day. This has been rolled out now in 73 schools, 12 of which are in Western Australia. Most of these are in the member for Durack's electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forty of those schools have had these school student attendance officers introduced in term 1. A further 33 were introduced in term 2. I can report that so far it has had some substantial results and substantial improvements. For example, in some places in the Northern Territory, the number of children in these schools where we have the attendance officers in place is now up 17 per cent on last year. A quarter of all schools in the stage 1 phase have had student attendance rate increases of between 15 and 25 percentage points. It is extraordinary that any school can have that type of increase at all, but it actually shows that in a quarter of the schools we are having tremendous results from these student attendance officers working with the local communities and working with families to get their children to school. Three quarters of the schools have had improvements in their student attendance rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not easy. A quarter of the schools still have not seen much improvement and there are a number of reasons for that. We constantly get advice from the student attendance officers as to what is going on in those schools and what can be done next to try to improve the student attendance rates. The member for Durack identified some of the issues which they have to tackle—whether it is parties going on at night or alcohol or substance abuse, including by the students themselves and that makes it so much more difficult. There are mobility issues, in that the students are more mobile than non-Indigenous students and may be in a different community at a particular time. All these create challenges, but we are determined to continue the roll-out of the Remote Students Attendance Strategy to monitor it closely, to work with the local leaders in those communities—because, at the end of the day, it has to be done with those local leaders—and to ensure that student attendance rates lift. If we cannot get student attendance rates higher, students will not be learning and if they are not learning then their prospects for employment are so much more difficult.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  The sum of $534.4 million has been ripped away from Indigenous programs in the government's budget. To make the situation is made worse, the government has provided no details or information. There is a single table on page 185 of Budget Paper No. 2. There is no detail, no explanation, no idea. Weeks later and the government has still been unable to explain the cuts, and service providers, their staff and clients will have to wait six to 12 months in limbo. I trust the parliamentary secretary takes note and that he is more enlightened than the Minister for Indigenous Affairs who claimed in Senate estimates on 30 May 2014 that $½ billion in cuts was merely an efficiency dividend. It was exposed as a feeble and false claim, when the minister's own department was forced to admit during estimates that the money was, in fact, direct cuts to programs. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm one was or the other that these are not efficiency dividends; these are programmatic cuts? If it is, however, an efficiency dividend, can the parliamentary secretary explain why Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are subject to an efficiency dividend of 4.5 per cent, which is much higher than the 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend that this government has applied across departments, agencies and portfolios? What evidence is the parliamentary secretary able to produce to justify the minister's claim that the money is not being taken away from frontline services, as he claimed to David Speers in the Sky News <span style="font-style:italic;">Agenda</span> program on 28 May.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the Prisoner Throughcare Program, funded through the NATSIL in New South Wales and the ACT, had its program funding cut by $½ million a year. Workers were told two weeks out that they would lose their jobs. Can the parliamentary secretary explain how this is not a frontline service? Can the parliamentary secretary explain why the government has cut funding for successful programs which help combat recidivism, when Indigenous incarceration rates are much worse than ever before? And the trend is going up. A total of $160 million has been cut from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health programs. Could the minister explain in detail which services are being cut? Could the minister detail what the assumed impact of the Medicare co-payment measure will be on budgets of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health services? What services will need to be cut if these health services are expected to absorb the costs of the co-payment? Who does the minister or the parliamentary secretary believe could absorb the co-payment for other services directed by the medical practitioner for the patient? Does the parliamentary secretary accept that if the co-payment—described as 'a demand reduction measure' by the Prime Minister—is not absorbed by the health services that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will choose not to get treatment? What are the estimates of the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who will take this option? Does the parliamentary secretary accept that this is an impairment to Closing the Gap and to addressing chronic disease? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Does the parliamentary secretary consider the COAG Reform Council, which was abolished in the budget, as unnecessary red tape? The council reports independently on progress on Closing the Gap and the National Partnership Agreements. The budget papers suggest that it may become the responsibility of PM&amp;C to report on themselves now that the COAG Reform Council has been axed. Can the parliamentary secretary confirm what or who will be the independent mechanism for monitoring and reporting on inter-governmental action to close the gap? Will these reports be publicly available? Or will this be simply a continuation of the alarming trend in the diminution of transparency and accountability of the government?</span>

There was a 4.5 per cent savings being made there. That is on the public record and the member for Blair has outlined that. How has that come about and why is this occurring? In part, every portfolio has had to make savings. My friend the member for Kooyong outlined the rationale for that. The public finances were a mess. We are spending $1 billion a month just on the interest payments on the Labor government debt and that is forecast to grow to $3 billion per month, so decisions had to be made across the board to make savings.</span>

                    </a>  There were 150 federal programs which were funded. If you went to any particular location you would likely find a similar number at the state level. What that has meant is a proliferation of individual activities and programs at a localised level, sometimes creating a whirlwind of activity of programs but very little progress being made. The Auditor-General looked this at the end of last year and did a case study on the community of Wilcannia. It is a typical community, predominantly Indigenous. He found that in this community of 474 Indigenous people there were 102 funded activities from 18 different agencies and a further 17 activities proposed. So in that place alone there was more than one program per five individuals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you listen to the member for Blair and, indeed, the opposition leader you would think that that is not enough, that we now need one program for one individual, possibly even more. We do not believe that is the case. In fact, what we have suggested through this budget process is that we need to sharpen the focus around a few core areas—school attendance, employment, community safety—and we have to streamline the activity so that as much as possible, from the Commonwealth's perspective, there is a single interface into a community rather than 15 or 30 or 50 interfaces into a community. So this budget does that. The first decision we made in order to facilitate that was to bring the programs from eight different departments into one department, the most important department: the Prime Minister's department. The second decision was to amalgamate 150 separate federal programs into five broad flexible programs. The third decision was that we will be devolving power to the local level so that a local empowered SES officer can negotiate with Indigenous community leaders over what is required in those communities against some of the national priorities which we have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of this will be to stop having that proliferation of activities of 100 programs in a community of 500 and instead have focused programs with empowered local leaders who can negotiate with a single Commonwealth officer over what is required in those communities. Of course in the process of doing that efficiencies can be made—of course they can because there is an overlap in activities. For example, the Smith Family has 10 individual contracts across Australia. Why do we need 10 contracts there instead of only one or two which could cover all activities? There are things which, frankly, are not working, and those things can be brought to a halt. As we go through these programs over the forward estimates, we will be stopping, evaluating initiatives, funding the ones which are working and halting the ones which are not.</span>

It was interesting to listen to the member for Blair asking questions of the parliamentary secretary. His focus was all about money. We know how well they handle money. They are not worried about the outcomes. They are not worried about the health outcomes for Indigenous people. They are not worried about that at all. It is all about money for them. They were never any good at it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You focused on education, and you talked about safer communities and effects on the ground. I was up at Alice Springs recently for the Indigenous round of the AFL. Sport and Indigenous people go together hand in hand. One of the outcomes that have been achieved up there—it has not been done by money; it has been work done on the ground—was the introduction of police outside liquor stores during the day. That has resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in violence and a 50 per cent reduction in hospital visits. That is an actual positive outcome. They are the sorts of things that they want on the ground. All you guys worry about is throwing money at it—just wasting it. You do not worry about where it is going.</span>

                    </a>  As I said before, the importance of sport in Indigenous affairs is well known around Australia. In particular, I would like to discuss the Clontarf football academies. Clontarf is in my electorate of Swan. The Clontarf Foundation was born there, with Gerard Neesham. We all know what he did with the Sydney Swans, Swan Districts and East Fremantle. Now, with the success of his academies, he has this most effective program to encourage Indigenous students to participate in school and sport at the same time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from my time playing AFL, and being involved with quite a few Indigenous players at East Perth over the years, the importance of it to them and how holistic it is with their total outcomes in life, particularly with some of the junior development programs that are run at the Perth Football Club, where I have been the director for junior development and am currently the patron. Those programs are run hand in hand with the Clontarf academies, encouraging Indigenous participation, particularly from the lower SES areas in my electorate, like Belmont, Lynward, Langford and those types of areas. They are currently looking at a proposal with the West Coast Eagles to have a program which involves developing people socially, holistically, and getting them back not only into sport but into school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Clontarf Foundation is responsible for those academies. It was established in 2000, for 25 boys in Waterford, in my electorate. That used to be a place for people from broken homes or orphanages. A gentleman I brought here many years ago said he escaped from there in the 1930s, along with 25 other boys, but they were eventually caught and sent off to other institutions. It was a good story. But Clontarf now have over 55 academies around Australia, with 2,900 students. The aim is to improve the education, discipline, self-esteem, leadership and employment prospects of young Aboriginal students. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have already highlighted how much of a focus you are putting on that area. The Clontarf program works by using the existing passion that Indigenous boys have for football to attract the boys to school and keep them there. In order for them to remain in the academy, the students must consistently endeavour to attend school regularly, apply themselves to the study of appropriate courses and embrace the academy's requirements for behaviour and self-discipline. Additionally, full-time locally based Clontarf staff mentor and counsel students on a range of behavioural, lifestyle issues to complement the education provided by schools and the AFL aspect provided by the academies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time you have left, could you outline what funding has been allocated to programs that encourage Indigenous participation in education in the budget, particularly with regard to programs in my electorate of Swan?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:29</span>):  I thank the member for Swan for his question, for his ongoing advocacy for Aboriginal people in his electorate and across Australia, and for his particular commitment to the Clontarf Foundation and the 55 academies which they run across Australia.  The member for Swan emphasised that, if money were the answer to Indigenous disadvantage, we would have solved it by now; there would not be disadvantage. We have had an 80 per cent increase, in real terms, in funding to Indigenous-specific programs over the last 10 years, but many of the indicators have not closed. The Productivity Commission found that we are spending about $44,000 per Indigenous individual on specific programs, and in remote communities it would probably be double that amount. It is clearly not just about money; it is about how the money is invested, how that money is allocated on the ground and what the focus is. And our focus is squarely on those three areas which I identified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to inform the member for Swan that the budget allocated a further $13.4 million to the Clontarf Foundation over the next four years. That will mean that an additional 3,000 boys will get an opportunity to participate in academies across Australia, and that will see almost a doubling of the operation of the Clontarf academies. We are doing this because Clontarf works. Earlier the member for Blair asked, 'What's going on with the budget?' Well, we are backing things which work. The Clontarf Academy is exactly one of those things which we want to back—with an additional $13.4 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday I visited the Bairnsdale Clontarf academy with the member for Gippsland. It was interesting speaking to a few of the graduates from the Bairnsdale academy. I recall one young fellow in particular. When he was 13 or 14 years old, he was effectively dropping out of school. He was attending school on maybe one day per week. He was reflecting that that was going to be his pathway. He was about to exit the school system entirely when he was 13 years old. But, because of the Clontarf academy which had just begun in Bairnsdale, he rejoined school and started attending regularly—in fact, 90 per cent of the time. He then went on and completed several more years of schooling and was assisted by the Clontarf academy into a job at the local Target store in Bairnsdale; he actually had a management role in the back office at Target. He is an outstanding young individual who otherwise would have been off the rails and probably would have been causing a bit of havoc in the community of Bairnsdale. But now he has an important job in the community. It would not surprise me if one day he is running that entire Target store—if he has not got a bigger role within the Wesfarmers Group—because he is a very impressive young man.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We met a number of other young men with very similar stories whose lives were literally transformed because of the work of the Clontarf academy. As the member for Swan knows, the Clontarf Foundation was started in Western Australia at the Clontarf school in the year 2000 by Gerard Neesham, who was the inaugural Dockers coach. I commend his commitment of over 14 years to this process. He and his staff have made a tremendous difference to thousands of boys, and, with this funding, we will hopefully support the work of the Clontarf Foundation to make a tremendous difference to another 3,000 boys over the four years ahead. There will be opportunities for schools to work with the Clontarf Foundation to make bids to provide academies in their electorate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, together with Neighbourhood Watch Australasia and Fairfield City Council, I hosted a family violence forum in Cabramatta. The forum served to launch a diagrammatic brochure produced by Neighbourhood Watch Australasia as part of their push in terms of the family violence campaign particularly directed at the multicultural communities of the country. The campaign titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Community Safety is Everyone's Responsibility</span> aims to send a strong message that family violence is a community issue and one that should not be and cannot be ignored. The brochures target ethnic communities who may be challenged in terms of language by visually communicating a strong message against family violence aimed at the victims, perpetrators and the community at large.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ingrid Stonhill, Chief Executive Officer of Neighbourhood Watch Australasia, who was also present at the forum, was accompanied by Neighbourhood Watch representatives Margaret Pearson and Clare McGrath from the ACT. I would like to thank Ingrid and, in particular, Pat Leary, President of Neighbourhood Watch Australasia, for taking part in this initiative, for taking a very strong leading role and for focusing this campaign clearly on family violence in multicultural communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being the most multicultural community in Australia is something my electorate and I are truly proud of. We revel in the colour, the vibrancy and the cultural diversity that that provides. There are, however, challenges posed by, in particular, language and cultural barriers. That is why it is critical to clearly communicate the information associated with legal processes and community expectations in areas with a high level of migrants, particularly in relation to this issue of family violence itself. Empowering the interaction between the police, victims and perpetrators is another crucial tool in the fight against domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Domestic violence represents a large proportion of the work of our local police. New South Wales Assistant Police Commissioner Mark Murdoch was also in attendance with a number of police officers, and they gave their full support to this initiative. In my local area, over 50 per cent of all assaults reported to the police are domestic violence related. I am told by Assistant Commissioner Murdoch that almost half of all homicide cases also involve domestic violence. One woman in Australia dies every week from domestic violence. Last year in New South Wales, 24 women were killed as a result of domestic violence and, regrettably, that included one young mother of three in Miller in my electorate. This is not surprising considering the statistic that one in three women is likely to become a victim of violence in her lifetime, while one in five is likely to experience sexual violence. Also in attendance were representatives from the Liverpool and Fairfield migrant resource centres as well as Bonnie Women's Refuge Ltd. These organisations play a key role in distributing the information associated with this campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family violence is a serious issue for the community and law enforcement agencies throughout Australia. It should be on the top of our national agenda, not just when we come together to commemorate White Ribbon Day, but constantly. Domestic violence is truly a horrific social problem. It has an immense and continuing impact not only on victims but also on Australian society as a whole. The message being communicated through these brochures at last week's forum is that it is vital for the functioning of our community and for future generations that we address the issue of domestic and family violence. This is an essential message and it is one that we do need to get out: domestic violence is not a private issue. We need the community to take a stand and to declare that enough is enough. We also need men to pledge never to commit, excuse or be silent about domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend Neighbourhood Watch Australasia for their hard work to make sure that the message reaches those who might otherwise miss out on this vital information and for creating safer communities for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  I checked the papers this morning and it is true: New South Wales won again last night, clinching their first State of Origin rugby league series in eight years. And last night we saw the probable end of the stellar career of Queensland player Brent Tate. Brent Tate came to Townsville at the end of the 2010 season after having ruptured his anterior crucial ligament in a test match for Australia. He was absolutely distraught at that time because he thought his career was over. I do not think anyone who saw him in the dressing sheds after that test match would have thought he would work his way back to play for the Cowboys and for Queensland, including man-of-the match performances, and also the Australian side that won the World Cup last year and the Four Nations in 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brent Tate has played nearly 250 games for the Broncos, the Warriors and the Cowboys. He played 26 tests, and last night was probably the last of his 23 State of Origin matches. He is married to Lani, a beautiful girl and a fantastic netball player—she plays for the Magnetic Steelcats in Townsville—and they have two beautiful kids. Last night's injury will be his fourth knee reconstruction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good friend of mine, Wayne Nicholson, is a fellow auctioneer in Townsville. He is very close to the Cowboys. Brent Tate is very special person. I am trying not to make this sound like a condolence motion, because he is not dead. He did not die; he has just done his knee. Nicho, as Wayne Nicholson is called, has a very special place in his heart for Brent Tate. Brent Tate is a fierce competitor. He shares a room, when he travels, with Gavin Cooper, and Gavin Cooper says he is angry at absolutely everything when they travel. But to see him with his wife and his kids you know he is a truly gifted human being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When he came to Townsville he was still undergoing very heavy rehabilitation for his knee and he made himself available to the Cowboys corporate team. I was doing some work for the Cowboys at that time and hosting pre-match events and those sorts of things where you would break out the player who was injured. Brent would come out. I would interview him. He would say a couple of things and say g'day to a couple of people. Brent Tate would not leave there until he had signed every autograph and until he had a beer and a chat with everyone who wanted to have a beer or a chat with him. He is a tremendous corporate personality and a tremendous corporate citizen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My son Andrew and I go to every home game of the Cowboys. Our favourite player at the Cowboys is Ray Thompson, who plays hooker and halfback. But Brent Tate is always a special person because you know that, off the field, he is this a lovely bloke, but when he goes on the field he is so angry. He will do many things after football, and I hope he will come back and play for the Cowboys. One of things he will do after he retires from football is speak to people, especially in business, about what it is to commit. Those of us in business understand that when you are doing cold calls or knocking on doors commitment is the ability to keep on going. When Brent had his third knee reconstruction he said that if they wanted him to do 150 squats he did 150 squats, because if he could not make it back he did not want it to be his fault. He wanted it to be because he could not possibly do it. So he dotted every i and he crossed every t. He made every session. He never complained. People in the business world or in the political world must remember that people do this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether in the sporting context—where people make sure that their rehabilitation is done correctly—or in the political context, where parliamentarians make sure that we see everyone in our electorate, there is so much that we can learn from a bloke like Brent Tate. I heard him speak recently. They asked him about his first State of Origin match. He came off the bench and he ran onto the field. He said that it is absolutely true that the crowd noise dies down as your heart rate goes through the roof and you go onto the field. He ran onto Lang Park and his heart stopped and he thought, 'O my god, I'm playing State of Origin.' It is at that moment that you realise just what a kid he is and what a gifted player he was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He has overcome a series of injuries. He had a terrible neck strain. He does not have a neck injury; he has a very simple neck which will get out of position and hurt the nerves in his arm. All he has ever wanted to be is a professional footballer—from the moment he was four years old and first saw it on TV.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He learnt under the tutelage of Wayne Bennett. He has been a fantastic citizen for Townsville. He has been a fantastic addition to the Queensland Cowboys. I do hope he comes back and plays again. He is an inspiration for absolutely everyone but he is also very proud of his wife and family. I want to make sure that he knows that football is football but life goes on and he will play his part. I think the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  Back in 2010 a group of traditional owners wrote to this parliament saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are the Traditional Owners of the Manuwangku/Warlmanpa Land Trust who do not want the nuclear waste dump.We are the nguramala from the land. The people from the land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You are a new parliament for Australia. We are asking that you give us a new start as Aboriginal people who are being threatened with this nuclear waste dump.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a bill that will soon come before this parliament, the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill. It will target our land for the waste dump.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are the Aboriginal people who own the land and the dreamings you are talking about. We are asking that you reject this bill and scrap Muckaty as a site for the waste dump.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The last two governments didn't listen to us—you must be different. We have been fighting for the last five years to say we don't want the waste dump in the land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are again inviting Minister Martin Ferguson and all members of the new parliament to come down and face us in our own country. Come and sit with us and hear the stories from the land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And they wrote more. And it was my privilege to attach that letter to a dissenting report that was tabled in the parliament when the House committee that inquired into the matter refused to hear any evidence from the traditional owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former minister, Martin Ferguson, refused to even go and sit down with the people on whose land they were about to impose a nuclear waste dump. Well, my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam met with them. My other Senate colleagues met with them. I met with them. I still have, in pride of place in my office, a sticker from their campaign saying 'No Nuclear Waste Dump on Our Land'. What became very apparent from meeting these traditional owners was that they had a fire burning deep within and such an amazing connection with their land and their country that they were not going to stop until the nuclear waste dump was removed from their land. Even as Labor and Liberals tried to close the door on them and stop them coming to this parliament to present their case, they fought and they took the matter to court. They should not have had to. The parliament should have listened. But they took the matter to court.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today they have been vindicated because the Federal Court has been told that the waste dump will now no longer go ahead. One of the traditional owners, Lorna Fejo, said she had fought hard to protect the land for her children and grandchildren:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My grandmother gave me that land in perfect condition, and other lands to my two brothers, who are now deceased. It was our duty to protect that land and water because it was a gift from my grandmother to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said she was now able to pass it on in perfect condition to those who come after her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a tribute to people with determination standing up for their country and a sign that, even when the majority of this parliament joins together to try and lock them out, people can win. I want to congratulate the many, many people who have been involved with this, in particular the Muckaty mob: Dianne Stokes, Kylie Sambo, Aunty Bunny Naparula, Mark Lane Jangala, Ronald Brown, Lorna Fejo, Dick Foster, Donna Jackson, Mitch, and all their families and supporters and the people of Tennant Creek and the Barkly Region. I also thank all those who assisted them: Nat Wasley, Dave Sweeney, Jim Green, Helen Caldicott, Leanne Minshull, Michael Fonda, Hillary Tyler, Justin Tutty, Cat Beaton, Lauren Mellor, Dimity Hawkins, Felicity Ruby, Jagath Dheerasekara, Ellie Gilbert, the Jumbunna Indigenous House of Learning, Rod Lucas and Peter Sutton. Again, I want to thank the people who supported them: Unions NT, the ACTU, the MUA and the ETU.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were ably assisted by a fantastic legal team: Lizzie O'Shea and Ron Merkel, whom I am proud to know well and who have stood up for justice and won, George Newhouse, Mark Cowan, Steven Lennard and David Yarrow. It is important to acknowledge as well that there were in fact a number of Labor members who stood with the community, including local MPs Gerry McCarthy, Elliot Macadam and Nova Peris. Perhaps there were others as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We turned our backs on these people in this parliament, but they fought on. I am so proud to have met these people who have campaigned and won. Planning to stick a nuclear waste dump on the land of people who need our assistance and help, treating it just as a place to dump nuclear toxic refuse, will be to the eternal shame of this parliament. We failed to stand up for these people. I am so pleased they have won. I want to pay particular tribute to my colleague Senator Scott Ludlam, who has worked tirelessly to support this community. It shows what happens when Greens in parliament and people of goodwill stand together and side by side with a community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Deputy Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  We are all familiar with the term 'give until it hurts'. There is an insidious form of giving which aims not only to hurt but to totally destroy livelihoods and whole industries of national importance in my electorate of Dawson. The giving I am referring to is of the deceptive Green variety, a giving which masquerades as being all about conservation but in reality is all about shutting down the coal industry. The amazing thing about this very destructive giving is that much of it goes on while enjoying tax deductibility status. That is something which has to stop. This giving has been highlighted most recently in two articles in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> newspaper and acknowledged as a serious concern by Senator Eric Abetz. An article on 2 June in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A LARGE donation originally “secured” by pressure group GetUp to fund its campaigns for last year’s federal election was provided to green group Friends of the Earth, meaning that the funds could be treated as a tax deduction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That large donation came from millionaire Wotif founder Graeme Wood. Essentially, it seems, Friends of the Earth receipted a $130,000 donation on behalf of GetUp! That money went to the Labor Party's marketing arm, Essential Media Communications, for communications research. The report from the research then went back to GetUp!, who ran a campaign leading up to the election favouring the parties they are most closely aligned with—Labor and the Greens. So for an organisation that screams about transparency in political donations, GetUp! seems to be very clever at attempting to cover its tracks in funding what was effectively a political campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us take a closer look at Friends of the Earth. They are obviously more of a good friend of the GetUp! organisation. Friends of the Earth have enjoyed tax-deductibility status for the last 12 years. It is such a giving organisation that it effectively gives its tax-deductibility status to other friends, including environmental political activist groups like Quit Coal and the Six Degrees coal and climate campaign. You would not expect a donation to Quit Coal—an organisation which conserves or protects absolutely nothing but blatantly seeks to destroy the livelihood of workers in the coal industry—to be tax-deductible, but apparently it is. If you go to the Friends of the Earth website and click on the 'donate' link, it takes you to a range of organisations you can donate to. One is Quit Coal, which proudly states that, yes, donations are tax-deductible. How can that be when Quit Coal is not on the deductible gift register? Quit Coal key spokesman Dominic O'Dwyer has proclaimed:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are a peaceful group but we are willing to break the law because it's so important to ensure that we get action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why can a group willing to break the law get tax-deductibility status? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate there are people working in coalmines and supporting industries who do the hard slog at work, take their pay and pay their tax dollars. They will have then have some of those tax dollars subsidise tax-deductibility for donations to groups who seek to take their very livelihood away from them. It is wrong for government to facilitate this process whereby tax dollars from those whose lives depend on the resource sector effectively subsidise those who want to shut down the resource sector. These groups include Friends of the Earth, the Lock the Gate Alliance, the Environmental Defenders Office, Greenpeace, the Nature Conservation Council, Beyond Zero Emissions and the Capricorn Conservation Council. All of the organisation I have just mentioned are signatories to the 'Stopping the Australian coal export boom' political action strategy. The Australian Marine Conservation Society also enjoys tax-deductibility status and they are behind the political campaign against the Abbot Point coal terminal called 'Fight for the reef'. It is wrong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, there is the Mackay Conservation Group, which also enjoys tax-deductibility. Currently, with the help of GetUp! and the Environmental Defenders Office, they are taking court action against the Abbot Point coal terminal development at Bowen. That is giving that really hurts Bowen, a community where businesses are seeing a drop in turnover of 30 per cent to 40 per cent and where about 30 businesses have already closed their doors. I say to the green activists: if you want to wage war against the resources sector that helps to keep this country afloat and which has enabled us to enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world, you should do so without the luxury of tax-deductibility status—which you do not deserve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am calling on the Australian Taxation Office to undertake a complete and forensic review not only of the activities of Friends of the Earth, which acts as a frontman for environmental political organisations and organisations like GetUp! and Quit Coal, but of the activities of all so-called environmental organisations on the Register of Environmental Organisations—which affords them deductible gift recipient status. The register needs cleansing. Of course there are many worthy conservation groups on that register, but we need to weed out those working against the decisions of government by waging environmental activist political campaigns. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, Sea Shepherd was refused tax-deductibility status by the ATO because it was found that the group's main activity was campaigning against whalers, not providing any direct care to animals. That is a very telling finding which should be applied elsewhere. It is time to stop these acts of giving which not only hurt but in fact destroy jobs and opportunity for so many. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="UK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  In stark contrast to the previous speaker, I want to congratulate the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and the Australian Conservation Foundation for their tremendous energy and commitment to the future of our beautiful, unique and fragile world. Today the Australian Conservation Foundation is delivering a petition to members of parliament with the signatures of over 34,000 Australians, asking us not to drop the ball on climate change. Led by ACF climate change campaigner Abigail Jabines and community delegates around Australia, such as Victoria's Caroline Ingvarson, the petition calls on all members of parliament to protect Australia's climate laws and to vote against the repeal of our climate legislation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have also brought to parliament a safe climate road map prepared by the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and endorsed by many young members of my electorate. A number of them came to my electorate office and urged me to support a strong renewable energy target. Indeed, it is absolutely scandalous that the Liberal Party could deceive the renewable energy industry and voters about its intentions concerning the renewable energy target the way it did last year. Environment Minister Hunt said on 27 February 2013:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will be keeping the Renewable Energy Target. We have made that commitment. We have no plans or proposals to change it. We have no plans or intentions for change and we have offered bipartisan support to that, and we will maintain bipartisan support towards the 20 per cent target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeat:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will maintain bipartisan support towards the 20 per cent target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later, on 19 June, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We agree on the national targets to reduce our emissions by five per cent by 2020. We also agree on the Renewable Energy Target and one of the things we do not want to do is to become a party where there's this wild sovereign risk where businesses take steps to their detriment on the basis of a pledge and a policy of government, and we are very clear that that is not where we want to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good grief. If you ever wanted an Exhibit A of wild sovereign risk, it would be this government's treatment of the renewable energy industry. There was a time when ministers and shadow ministers would resign if their credibility had been damaged by things they had said or done, or simply by things that happened subsequent to their statements or actions. The things that have happened around climate change on this government's watch have completely and utterly stripped the environment minister of all credibility. He should do the honourable thing and resign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the axing of the Climate Commission, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. It is not just the inquiry into the Renewable Energy Target or the shameful international position the government has taken, saying that no country can be expected to sacrifice resource revenue to tackle climate change. Is the Prime Minister not aware that the economy is a wholly owned subsidiarity of the environment? No environment, no economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worse than that: the Prime Minister appointed Maurice Newman as chairman of his Business Advisory Council. Mr Newman describes climate change as a 'scientific delusion'. He says Australia is 'hostage to climate change madness' and accuses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of dishonesty and deceit. And the Prime Minister makes this man his business adviser!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it a scientific delusion that, in Australia, average air temperatures have increased by 0.9 degrees Celsius since 1910? Is it a scientific delusion that, since the 1950s, every decade has been warmer than the one before? Is it a scientific delusion that 2013 was Australia's hottest year since records began more than a century ago? Given these facts, it would be crazy for governments and business not take the forecasts seriously. These forecasts include more heatwaves, more droughts and more bushfires. It would be imprudent and negligent for either government or business to ignore this. The tragedy of these kinds of disasters is avoidable. The renewable energy industry has the capacity—if only we helped it rather than trying to strangle it—to take us down a very different path. The CEO of the Clean Energy Council, David Green, said that solar PV is transitioning from being disruptive technology to being incumbent technology, displacing coal; generation will move from its traditional place at the point of supply to at or near the point of use. Climate change is happening now and our response needs to be on a scale, and of an urgency, that matches the problem.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUTCHINSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  Maybe the member for Wills could move to Tasmania? It is a wonderful climate down there; a couple of degrees warmer has great benefits for the many aspects of life in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tunbridge husband-and-wife farming couple, Richard and Emily Gardner, are among the leaders of a revolution underway in Tasmania that will cement my state's reputation as the most reliable source of food and fibre on a continent often challenged by harsh climatic conditions over many years. Early in August will be the opening and commissioning of the largest irrigation scheme in the state of Tasmania, the Midlands irrigation scheme, which will deliver 38,500 megalitres to over 55,500 hectares in the Midlands of Tasmania. To put that in perspective, that is an area greater than the Ord River scheme. It is a significant project by any scale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmania only has two per cent of the nation's land mass but, because of its unique maritime climate at the edge of the Southern Ocean, it has 30 per cent of Australia's total rainfall run-off. That is twice as much as the Murray-Darling Basin. Unfortunately, though, much of it falls in the wrong area with respect to agriculture, but this has been capitalised on in central and western parts of the state through hydro-electricity generation. People ask me why, then, in my home state—and particularly in my largely rural electorate of Lyons—I am working so hard on building irrigation schemes for a place where there is so much rain. The key for Tasmanian farmers is to capture the water to harness the rainfall run-off for later use, before it runs out to sea. Creating further water storages and irrigation for primary production unlocks the massive potential of Tasmania's food production and helps the transformation of traditional produce pursuits such as grazing into higher value outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, plans are well advanced to build five additional irrigation schemes across the state, which will have a combined construction and implementation cost of nearly half a billion dollars. These are in the Scottsdale region of the north-east in the electorate of Bass; the Swan River on the east coast in my electorate of Lyons; the Southern Highlands scheme, also in Lyons; the North Esk scheme in Lyons; and the Circular Head scheme up on the north-west coast in the electorate of Braddon. Two of these will be shovel-ready by the end of this year, with the three others not far behind. The five proposed new schemes will need funding totalling approximately $140 million from state and federal governments in addition to the $52 million that will be contributed through irrigators in investments in water entitlements, and an additional private investment on-farm in excess of $200 million for irrigation infrastructure, be it dams or delivery systems. In my electorate of Lyons the Central Highlands is one of the oldest and most sparsely populated areas in the state. Water from the Southern Highlands Irrigation Scheme will be used primarily for cropping, including for poppies—opiate production; cereals and pasture seeds; and irrigated grazing systems to produce prime lambs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other potential for huge economic growth is that traditional grazing properties can undergo dairy conversions to expand what is a really booming industry within the state of Tasmania. Recently we have also seen horticultural interests in the form of cherry orchards established in that area. A $28.5 million scheme has also been designed to deliver summer water to a region held back by a lack of reliable water—yes, it does happen in Tasmania. Due to drought, the Central Highlands was declared an exceptional circumstances zone from 2000 to 2002, and again from 2006 to 2008. In addition, two water supply emergency zones have been declared for the Southern Highlands by the state government since 2007.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Southern Highlands project has an additional benefit of improving the reliability of drinking water supply in the town of Bothwell, which ran out of water during last year's most recent drought. Flow-on economic benefits for the area will include more than 30 full-time jobs in the area as well as 13 indirect jobs. The proposed Swan River scheme on Tasmania's east coast will support viticulture, grazing, irrigated cropping and walnut enterprises. These indeed are valuable investments in my home state, and I will be working very hard with the relevant ministers to seek the federal government's contribution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) Transport modelling indicates that by 2031, 100,000 to 120,000 vehicles will travel along the Eastern section of the East West Link using the three lane twin tunnels (detailed transport modelling is yet to be undertaken for the Western section). There are many inputs into the transport model and forward petrol price projecting is one such input.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) The transport model is sensitive to many different inputs including population growth, network improvements elsewhere on the Melbourne network, car occupancy, public transport fares and vehicle operating costs, including the price of petrol. Sensitivity tests are undertaken with different values for particular parameters to understand the impact on travel demand. The published forecast takes account of the various considered scenarios. </span>
