                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will allow the cashless debit card to be rolled out to a fourth site, the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area in Queensland, from later this year. The cashless debit card will operate in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay until 30 June 2020. This will allow time to rollout the program in this area, and allow it to operate for a minimum of 12 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill updates the current limitations on the number of participants from 10,000 to 15,000, recognising the increase that would come from implementing the cashless debit card to this area. Like the current trial sites, the bill introduces provisions that allow merchants to block restricted goods at the point of sale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the purposes of the bill, the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area has been defined as the federal electoral division of Hinkler, in line with the electoral boundaries as at 31 May 2018.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to have the criteria for trial participants in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay site outlined in the legislation. Those persons living in this area aged under 36 years of age, and receiving Newstart allowance, youth allowance (jobseeker), parenting payment (single) or parenting payment (partnered) would be transitioned onto the cashless debit card.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This would impact around 6,700 people, and represents a more targeted approach to the one taken in Ceduna in South Australia and the East Kimberley and Goldfields in Western Australia. If passed, it will be the largest of all the card trial sites.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Expansion of the cashless debit card under these criteria will allow the effectiveness of the program to be further tested and understood in the context of a larger urban population. It is also an opportunity to test the technology in a more diverse community. This area has a significantly different demographic than other sites currently operating.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will allow the government to test the impacts of the cashless debit card trial exclusively for the selected group, as has been asked for by the community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These exemptions and discretionary powers will be used to ensure vulnerable people are not adversely affected by the trial.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The selection of the cohort in this area has occurred as a result of significant consultation with the community. This is designed to help address key social problems that local people have identified during meetings, in particular high youth unemployment, intergenerational welfare dependence and local children whose needs are not being met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to regional youth unemployment data from March 2018, these communities have a youth unemployment rate of 28.7 per cent, an increase of four per cent since last year. This compares to the state average of 13.4 per cent.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bundaberg and Hervey Bay has a high level of long-term and intergenerational welfare dependency. Children born to parents who are welfare dependent are more likely to become welfare dependent themselves.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety per cent of the people in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay under 30 and on Newstart or youth allowance had a parent or guardian who received income support at some point in the last 15 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of that cohort, around 13 per cent had a parent or guardian who received income support at least once each year for the past 15 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Findings by the Australian Research Council indicate that risk factors such as attitudes to work and welfare, attitudes towards alcohol and drug consumption and family influences contribute to intergenerational welfare dependency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The council also found evidence that young people from welfare dependent families are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol or consume illegal drugs, highlighting the relationship that welfare dependence has on a young person's outcomes in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On average across Australia, 46 per cent of people attending government-funded financial counselling for their problem gambling were also receiving a taxpayer-funded benefit. In the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area, it is 73 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, people attending financial counselling for their problem gambling in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area are more likely to have been on their current benefit for longer than 5 years, compared to other people in Australia attending problem gambling counselling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card could help to stabilise the lives of young people in the area by limiting spending on alcohol, drugs and gambling, thus improving their chances of finding employment or successfully completing education or training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By targeting a younger cohort, we can influence positive behaviour change before welfare dependency becomes entrenched in a person's lifestyle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen that a 'spillover' benefit of the card is that it can increase motivation to find work. As part of the final evaluation report of the cashless debit card trial, we received feedback from some card participants in September 2017 that almost a quarter of people on the card are spending several hours a week looking for work. This is an increase from 11 per cent in February 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have previously stated, the Department of Social Services has undertaken significant consultations with key stakeholders and community members. Specifically, between May and December 2017, over 188 meetings, including three community information sessions, were held across the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Community Reference Group was established in late 2017 to work through local policy and implementation issues to ensure the cashless debit card is implemented effectively in their community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, a local shopfront will be established with staff who could link people with existing services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Community Reference Group, the department will monitor service demand to ensure the cashless debit card is complemented by appropriate supports for people as they adjust to this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Complementing the card will be a further investment in community services of $1 million. There are already a significant number of services in place, including 70 federally funded services across the area, which includes drug and alcohol services, financial capability services, employment and families' and children's programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will allow the program to respond to unforeseeable circumstances, such as wide-scale power outages and natural disasters, allowing trial participants in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay to access their full payment as cash.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will ensure participants and their families remain supported in the event of wide-scale emergencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bill will also allow the option of establishing a community panel in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area to allow participants in the area to apply to have access to a higher portion of unrestricted funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consultations with community leaders in the area have indicated that a panel will be useful to make the trial flexible to the needs of their community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also announced a second evaluation of the cashless debit card across all three current trial sites, to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second evaluation will use research methodologies developed independently by the University of Queensland, and draw on the baseline measurements of social conditions in the Goldfields, developed by the University of Adelaide. Findings from the second evaluation will be published in late 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should this bill pass, the government will also evaluate the card's operation in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To support the cashless debit card trial, this bill will strengthen the provisions that enable merchants to block the sale of restricted goods to trial participants at the point of sale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Merchants in trial sites will more readily be able to service participants of the program, through the option to implement product level blocking solutions, automatically blocking transactions where a participant is attempting to purchase restricted goods with the card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing so, the bill also clarifies the restriction on 'cash-like' products, such as gift cards, vouchers, money orders, or digital currency, where these could be used to purchase alcohol and gambling products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These products are included as restricted goods, as has always been the intention of the program. Clarifying this provision to include 'cash-like' products will support product-level blocking amendments, and help prevent participants from circumventing the program and spending their welfare payments on alcohol, gambling and drugs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card is a world first in how it operates. The evaluation has been conducted and it has been shown to work. Consultation in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay area demonstrates it needs a way to break the cycle of welfare dependency, and help people manage their income and stabilise their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the parliament to back this trial for Hervey Bay and Bundaberg, to provide the community a trial that they have asked for.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—Few things attract the attention of Australia, its workers and the economy in general as does our preparation of the next generation of this great nation to lead our way as a growing economy, preserving a uniquely high standard of living, and ensuring that that's achieved through education. Plenty of lip service is given to the importance of education, but direct comparisons with other countries are notoriously difficult. We can only really notice what stands out, unique within Australia's system—and that is a high-quality, well-funded education system, from zero all the way through to lifetime education—and then do our best in those important transitions from zero to five into formal primary schooling, from primary to high, from high to tertiary and vocational, and obviously then into a working career, where Australians will continually return to the education system to update their skills in an increasingly mobile and fast-changing future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To do that, we've, in our committee, taken a real focus on the areas that we can improve, in an education system that, at school level, is well known for having a high number of formal contact hours, relatively high per-student levels of funding, relatively similar vocational and tertiary wage outcomes for the two major sectors compared to OECD comparators, but a fairly flat teaching promotional structure where, in Australia, the average teacher arrives at their highest salary increment after just nine years in the job, and that is less than half of the OECD average. It sets us a real challenge to find areas where we can improve both the quality of education and, more importantly, the outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this committee found is that we still, predominantly, focus on inputs to the system. There is a great reluctance to report on outcomes because we're not confident that they fully measure what education seeks to achieve. What we've found in this committee is that we need to start that process with the evidence that we have. If there is a need to improve those metrics then let the reporting of current data be the driving force for even better metrics. But to have no reporting of metrics leaves us very much in the dark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An important step in the direction of the reporting, obviously, is NAPLAN. Speaker, you'll be familiar with ATAR, with Queensland becoming the last state to switch to ATAR in 2019. This gives us a unique opportunity, as we've mentioned in recommendation 10, to start to measure gain through the education system while that's possible, and it's predominantly in the core skills. Over time, as we noted in the report, there'll be increased emphasis on identifying soft-skill progression and the ability to measure that in our students—identifying how important that is, going into the next century. We also made important recommendations, 17 and 18, towards better career advice. It concerns me greatly that the exit polls from various educational institutions vary not by the students that are within them but by the preferences of the institutions very much driving whether someone takes a vocational or a tertiary path. Often we can't find any other explanation for why students are being funnelled in particular directions. We certainly repeat many previous reports that we need to raise the status of vocational education and training, mindful that there have been significant university reforms around funding that have led to inequities and a risk that students are drawn towards the preferential funding arrangements we see in tertiary education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last, but not least, in addition to better initial teacher education, recommendation 7 talks about the working conditions of teachers—something that I've been obviously vocal about, unrelated as to my role as chair. We really do find that there are very good grounds for better support for teachers in their work by decluttering their careers, by allowing promotional structures and more opportunities for research—something we do see in the health sector but not necessarily in teaching—and by taking on these lignified historic structures that teachers often work within that may be impeding their ability to engage in high levels of research and more detailed levels of formative assessment of their students. We were encouraged that, at around the same time we were reporting, Gonski 2 reflected many of these recommendations as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recommend the report to every person who is passionate about education. I thank the deputy chair and the entire committee for their enormous support in preparing this document. I'm delighted that there was almost universal agreement within the committee on the content of this report. I thank the secretariat as well.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:55</span>):  by leave—This Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report is important because it focuses on how to best prepare young people as they transition out of school and towards work, whether that be directly into the workforce or into postsecondary education. As the chair has said, this inquiry covered a significant amount of ground. I can't do that justice in making this brief statement today, but I do want to touch on a few issues that I think are really important in understanding where the committee was coming from in this report, the submissions that were made to us and the general views that we heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important when you consider people's preparedness for the workplace to think about the quality of teaching and schooling as they were being prepared. That means looking at a number of things. Of course, it means looking at funding, as the chair has said, but we were very interested in what might be done to make sure that teachers could, one, continue to improve the quality of their skills as they practise their profession and, two, be given the freedom to actually practise their profession. One recommendation we made that I want to mention is that the government look at what can be done to free up teachers to teach. They're doing a lot of non-teaching work as teachers—work that might be better described as social work or youth work. We need a situation in Australia where teachers are free to teach, to be educators. That, of course, means continuing to update their knowledge and skills. In a profession you don't finish your formal education and have your skills set in stone forever. Of course, in all the professions we do see continuing professional development. In teaching the workload and pressures are such within teaching hours that often teachers find it quite difficult to just have the capacity, time and ability to undertake ongoing professional development in an organised way. So one of the recommendations we made was that the government look at providing more non-teaching support for kids in school, whether that be social work, youth work or others forms of support, to allow teachers to be given that time and opportunity to teach and to engage in continuing professional development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention the importance of raising the status of the profession of teaching. It's something the chair has spoken about as well. It is important that we continue to raise the status of teaching as a profession. There can't be really too many more important professions than that of teacher when you think about the fact that we are relying on teachers really—and, of course, parents as the child's first and most important teachers—to make sure that future generations are able to be not just wonderful workers with great skills and knowledge but also very good citizens and participants in our democracy. It is an incredibly important job, and the more that we can do to raise the status of the profession of teaching the better. That's certainly mentioned in this report, including, as the chair said, in relation to the question of remuneration for teachers, which, of course, remains a significant marker of the esteem in which the profession is held by the community, the Commonwealth and state governments as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention very briefly an issue that the committee touched on but felt were not in a position to really do justice to. That's the question: how do we make sure that there is adequate support for students with a disability and for students who are themselves carers for people with a disability as they transition from education into postsecondary education or into work? There are some recommendations in relation to students with a disability and in relation to students who themselves are carers, but we also acknowledged in the report that we did receive significant evidence and submissions in respect of these very complex issues and that it's a matter that would benefit from further investigation and inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other couple of things I wanted to just briefly mention in respect of this report go to a couple of other important cohorts. One is First Nations children, or Indigenous children. We have a situation where the outcomes are not as they should be for kids from Aboriginal backgrounds or from Torres Strait Islander backgrounds. The committee made some recommendations in respect of improving support and outcomes for those kids. Similarly, for children from cultural and linguistically diverse backgrounds, we've made some recommendations as to what might be able to be done to improve their ability to transition out of education and into postsecondary education or work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only other thing I wanted to briefly mention is the importance of work-integrated learning in schools. It's a topic that, as you know, the previous Chief Scientist has had a lot to say about, and the current Chief Scientist as well. We are very interested in what can be done to make sure that work experience continues and also, as the chair said, to make sure that there is good career advice. It was a consistent theme throughout the inquiry that career advisory services in schools need improvement. I hope that the government takes that issue on board very seriously so that kids and their parents can be given some confidence in making the decisions that will affect their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend the report to the House. I thank the chair for his collaborative approach to this inquiry. The chair and I were able to engage in very constructive conversations and to incorporate each other's views into this report, so I thank the chair, and, of course, I thank all of the members of the committee, all of the submitters, all of the people who gave evidence and all of the staff who assisted.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="A9B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  Labor does not oppose the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017. However, the circumstances which gave rise to it coming before the parliament do require further scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say by way of commencement that there is something very ominous about the fact that a bill which is about communications legislation, which is about providing a fund to assist regional and small publishers, which has the title Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund and which is brought into this House by the government cannot attract a single member from the government to speak in favour of it. Not one single government member, apart from the minister who introduced this bill in the House, has thought that this bill was important enough for them to come into the parliament and speak in favour of it. Perhaps what I'll go through, which explains some of the circumstances which brought this bill before the House, explains why there is not one government MP, and particularly not one government MP from a regional electorate, who's willing to speak in favour of the establishment of a Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The context is everything. In October last year, the government was determined to remove the two out-of-three rule, which prohibited a person owning all three licences—television, radio and newspaper—in a single radio broadcasting area or in a single market. Labor opposed this proposition. The government had been pushing it for many years. The industry, particularly the television industry, had been advocating very strenuously in favour of it. Labor opposed it on public interest grounds. Quite simply, we were concerned that giving three green lights to media companies to merge would lead to fewer voices, less diversity and certainly fewer jobs in the television broadcasting industry, in the print publishing industry and in radio broadcasting. In fact, if, as many tried to argue, these mergers were going to create more jobs, it would be the first time in the history of the industry that two companies merging into one actually created more jobs. We know that this has never occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government was determined to do it, but they did not have the numbers. They didn't have the numbers to get the legislation through the Senate. So what we saw over the course of several months were more deals being done than at a blackjack table at Star Casino on a Saturday night. There was One Nation, that was willing to dust off its culture wars against the ABC—and there are always many members in the coalition parties who are willing to jump in on this one—and the result of that was the competitive neutrality review, which is nothing more than an attempt to continue the culture wars against the ABC. Why, I do not know, because if you cripple the ABC, you'll cripple the capacity of regional storytelling in this country. There is not a publisher or broadcaster in the country that has a greater commitment to rural and regional reporting than the ABC. But that is the wisdom of One Nation, and many of those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there were plans to give special tax exemptions. They were floated and sunk almost as quickly as they were raised. But then there was the Nick Xenophon Team, once a member of the other place, spectacularly imploding after the recent South Australian elections. They managed to strike a deal with the government which enabled the last bulwark against the merger of these large television entities with radio and print entities being removed. The deal that they did concluded in a fund being established, which is now the subject of this legislation, with some $50 million worth of funds to be set aside—and I'll go to the details of this in a moment—together with $8 million being set aside to create 200 short-term cadetships and another $2.4 million over three years to facilitate the establishment of 60 regional journalism scholarships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, of course, Labor supports small publishers; of course, Labor supports more regional journalists; and, of course, Labor supports initiatives which will see more cadets entering the industry. But we are not convinced about the measures that are a part of what many are calling—and I happen to agree—a dirty deal with the Nick Xenophon Team to enable the largest media deregulation initiative to pass through this parliament in decades to occur. We do not think they were worth the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another important point about the context of the bills before the House, and that goes to what can only be described as the collapse of the traditional business model that has supported what we now refer to as 'traditional' media and the traditional media outlets in this country—and, in fact, right around the world. The first onset of the collapse of this business model occurred with the print media. Print media has operated in this country for close to 200 years under a pretty unsophisticated business model. You bolt a series of news stories onto the back of a big book of advertising and you sell that to your consumers. You would remember the times, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon: on a Saturday there would be three thuds on your front lawn, which were the Saturday edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> being delivered. Two of those thuds were classified advertising. It now arrives with more of a pat than a thud, in one roll. The reason for that is the collapse of the classified advertising business as it once was. That has come through online classifieds. Quite frankly, most of the print media either didn't see this happening or were not nimble enough in their response to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, TV was second. What we are seeing is a drift of eyeballs from big screens to small screens. Quite simply, people's viewing habits are changing. It is now more the case that, if you are under the age of 20, it's more likely that you are going to be doing your media consumption on an iPhone, an iPad or an Android device than on the big box in the corner of your lounge room. And with eyeballs goes the advertising. Of course, this didn't happen alone. You saw a recycling or a pinching of content by other online players, whether that be Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and others, but this has put enormous pressure on the traditional revenues of the traditional TV businesses in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Radio, I have to say, which many were predicting was going to collapse, has seen itself being much more resilient. Perhaps that's because it's always on. You're able to listen to the radio while doing several other things, and it has been more local and more nimble, which has enabled it to persevere and succeed when many of its traditional rivals were collapsing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we have seen jobs being lost and journalists' jobs being lost in great numbers. Over the last five years alone, over 3,000 full-time, paid journalist jobs have been lost from the industry. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance estimates that nearly one-quarter of all working journalists have lost their jobs, as we've seen these changes—technological, economic and business model changes—work their way through the industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, these three things—the determination of the government to agree to remove the protections against further media mergers within the TV, radio and print media market; the fact that they didn't have the numbers, and they had to do a dirty deal with the Nick Xenophon Team and the crossbenchers; and the fact that we are seeing what many describe as a collapse in the traditional business models which have supported media in this country—are the context which brings this bill before the House. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself, as I've described in outline form, will establish a regional and small business innovation fund. It's part of a package, which also includes the establishment of a one-off funding arrangement for the establishment of cadets, and a one-off funding arrangement which will support scholarships. The fund will enable three tranches of grants, of $16.7 million each, over the period from 2018-19 to 2019-20 and 2020-21. The grants will be administered at arms-length from government. However, government has set the rules about who is and who isn't eligible for this, and the other aspects of the deal that was done. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, will be the independent statutory body which administers the distribution of the grants. They'll be contestable. Presumably the instruments which will be necessary to advertise the commencement of this fund will be made public soon after the passage of these bills through both houses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support the legislation. We are sceptical about its origins, and we are also sceptical about its capacity to make a demonstrable difference to the crisis which media is facing around the country. You would have thought, at a time where media outlets around the country, many of whom, particularly in the print media, are closing down or consolidating or reducing staff within newsrooms, that the government would take a view about the one media outlet that it, in and of itself, funds: that it would be doing more to support that media outlet to ensure that that media outlet, particularly in rural and regional Australia, was able to continue to tell stories about rural and regional Australia, and to ensure that those people are represented in the national narrative. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, sadly, in the budget that was introduced not three weeks ago we see the very opposite of that. We see the government taking up the cudgels in the cultural war against the ABC, with $84 million worth of cuts to the ABC's triennial funding. This is nothing more than the government attacking the institution because it disagrees with some of the stories that the ABC runs. Well, I disagree with many of the stories that the ABC runs as well. I don't like it when I'm interviewed by the ABC and they give me a hard time and they put the blowtorch on the soles of my feet and take me to places that I may not necessarily like. But I understand that that's their job. I understand it is the job of a fiercely independent national broadcaster, with first-class journalists, to put the people who come to this place to the test, and people who are in government or aspire to form government to the test, to ensure that the Fourth Estate actually does its job—that it does its job of keeping the government and the elected representatives to account. For a government to punish a national broadcaster because it disagrees with its editorial content is nothing more than antidemocratic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On budget night the cheers were audible throughout the chamber when the Treasurer announced his $84 million worth of budget cuts to the ABC. But I guarantee you this: if there are job cuts from the ABC in those very same members' electorates, they will be the first to complain. You don't have to take my word for it. There's a by-election going on in Braddon in Tasmania as we speak. And what was the first commitment that the Liberal candidate in that by-election, one Brett Whiteley—not the oil painter—gave to his putative voters? It was, 'My government's $84 million worth of budget cuts will not fall on the ABC's studio in Burnie.' There is a brave tiger; there is somebody out there championing the government's budget. Yes, 'Let those budget cuts fall on every other electorate in the country, but not on mine.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  I thank the member for Whitlam for his great contribution and for the great work that he does in this area. Like the member for Whitlam, I rise to put Labor's position with regard to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund) Bill 2017 on the record today in light of the many deals that were done—in fact, so many dirty deals, I think the preceding speaker, the member for Whitlam, mentioned—by this coalition government. Just this week, we saw Senator Hanson's secret deal to secure her support to give $80 billion to big business, multinationals and the big banks. I think we've got the fourth iteration of that deal at the moment. They do say that sausages are like sausage making: it's horrible when you actually see the process. But when we examine the input of the 'supreme president for life', Senator Hanson, the details are truly 'offal'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this particular deal, the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, exists only because of a shoddy, last-minute backroom deal between the Turnbull LNP government and the Nick Xenophon political party, who now refer to themselves as Centre Alliance—an optimistic moniker at best. I don't think they're yet to earn either of those titles. So this fund is the result of a heavily compromised trade-off. The fund didn't come about because the Turnbull LNP government is genuinely committed to promoting public interest journalism—far from it. It came about to grease the path for the government's repeal of the two-out-of-three media control rule. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will not oppose this bill, but we maintain that it does precious little to fill the void left by the repeal of the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule. This rule acted as a public interest safeguard by stopping any one voice in the media landscape from becoming too dominant. It promoted diversity and competition between different voices. A 'bulwalk against authoritarianism' is how I've always seen this media rule operating. The two-our-of-three rule ensured that no individual or company controlled more than two out of three regulated media platforms—commercial television, commercial radio or associated newspapers—in the same licence area. In essence, it was to preserve a diversity of opinion on our airwaves, and it stimulated alternative viewpoints. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the six months that have passed since the Turnbull government abolished the two-out-of-three cross-media control rule, cross-media merges have begun as a result. How many have actually come through? Zero. The milestone makes a mockery of communication minister Senator Fifield's alarmist urgings that parliament must act on media reforms to protect Australian jobs and to give industry a fighting chance and of his dire predictions of the failure of Australian media organisations. Senator Fifield even went so far as to suggest that Labor's opposition to the repeal was crippling the industry and limiting the options for organisations like Channel Ten. How wrong he was. Just on a sidenote, I commend Channel Ten for their stance on axing the TV show <span style="font-style:italic;">Roseanne</span> in light of her offensive comments. They were out of the blocks quickly. Well done, Channel Ten. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back to this legislation: development since that time clearly demonstrates just how captured by the top end of the sector the Turnbull government was, and how out of touch it clearly remains. The CBS acquisition of Channel Ten occurred thanks to the two-out-of-three rule. So, as it was actually working as designed and benefitting the sector, the geniuses in the coalition decided that they'd best get rid of the rule. So, well done! It is so dangerous without it. The repeal of this rule is a threat to informed democratic debate, as it allows a single person or organisation to control how local news is reported. This potentially gives one person a lot of power in a market where big media players are already wielding a great deal of power. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian media landscape is one of the most concentrated in the world, with an extremely small number of firms producing content that reaches the vast majority of Australians. According to market research from IBISWorld from June 2016, the industry's four largest players were estimated to have accounted for over 90 per cent of industry revenue since 2015-16. These players included News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, Seven West Media and APN News &amp; Media. Obviously, we all know the role of our national broadcaster, the long-trusted, ever-professional ABC. In the budget, the ABC is suffering yet another cut of $84 million. That's on top of the $254 million cut in that horror 2014 budget, after the then Liberal Leader of the Opposition had said before the election that there will be no cuts to the ABC. As anyone who understands the ABC would know, there was no fat to be cut in 2014. But, after those two big cuts of $84 million and $254 million, we're not slicing off any fat; we're now slicing off muscle and making our national broadcaster less affective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyway, back to this fund: this one-off fund will dispense $50 million of taxpayer funds over three years before it runs out. What then? The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, or MEAA, has expressed concern that these short-term programs, without adequate follow-up, may serve only to temporarily boost the numbers and scope of journalism and journalists. MEAA argues that the benefits of the program will be exhausted shortly after the 2020-21 financial year, unless consideration is given to sustaining these programs during their rollout. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes it is imperative that taxpayer support for journalism be ideology-free. However, there is considerable scope for government to influence the way the funding is distributed. The government already appears to be influencing the recipients of this funding through the inclusion of the foreign parent company veto. The foreign parent company veto was likely included with the aim of preventing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>Australia<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>from receiving funding from this grant, given they have selectively waived the veto for other media groups. <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> is a little progressive, but any progressive outfit that provides high-quality journalism on the digital platforms should be cultivated, surely. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ACMA will also have considerable leeway to decide the purposes for which funding will be allocated. The legislation does not require that an advisory committee be set up to advise ACMA. This is all subject to the minister's discretion. The whims and whimsies of the minister are supreme, as there are no checks and balances on his decision. How is the foreign parent company veto being used? A range of publishers like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">BuzzFeed</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Daily</span> have been excluded from the fund due to having a foreign parent company. Publishers affiliated with a superannuation fund are also excluded from accessing the fund. So, while <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> Australia has a foreign parent company, its local business, supporting Australian journalism and publishing jobs, depends on maintaining a viable Australian revenue model. The Guardian Australia has created 80 jobs for Australians over the last few years. The Guardian argues that is every dollar of revenue it earns in Australia is invested in Australian journalism, given they have no shareholders or proprietors to pay. If the package were really intended to boost Australian journalism, why was The Guardian excluded? The Guardian argues that this legislation disadvantages a fast-growing source of Australian news and jobs for Australian journalists, when the whole purpose of the fund is to encourage both these things—a pretty fair point, if you ask me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How does the Turnbull government justify giving $30 million to Fox Sports but cutting Australian content creators like The Guardian Australia out of the fund? Let's just think: both are Australian companies with a foreign based parent company. It sounds a bit fishy to me; in fact it stinks. They say that a fish rots from the head first. Fox Sports, owned by News Corporation, another company with a foreign parent, was granted $30 million in the 2017 federal budget with the vague purpose of covering women's sports and niche sports. This grant was dodgy. It was provided without conditions or any transparent process. I love sport. I love netball. I love all the sorts of sports they're talking about, but last time I checked we had a public broadcaster or two funded to perform exactly this role. Don't get me wrong: broadcasting and supporting women's sport is a good use of money. Young girls can't be what they can't see—perhaps an important message for all the people on that side of the House that talk about quotas! If that were the endeavour, surely our trusted public broadcasters ABC or SBS would have been better placed to host that content. $30 million given to them to bring in those niche sports and transmit them would have gone a long way with people that know how to do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like The Guardian and other outlets, publicly owned media are ineligible for funding under this measure despite the government funding cuts they have been subjected to in recent years. As I said, the budget handed down by Treasurer Morrison and Prime Minister Turnbull cuts $84 million from the ABC on top of the $254 million the LNP have already cut since the 2013 election. The sneaky way the government cut funding from the ABC, hidden in the fine print of the budget papers, was to freeze the indexation of ABC's operational funding, amounting to a cut of $83.7 million. When the ABC's core content costs are rising faster than inflation, that is an cut in absolute terms. You can't argue otherwise. They articulated that it's to ensure the ABC continues to find back-office efficiencies. I think One Nation is pursuing the fact that they might drink coffee sometimes on budget mornings out in front of Parliament House, but I'm sure there's not $83.7 million worth of coffee being consumed at the ABC. The government should know that they can't squeeze blood from a stone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC itself says it's out of fat to cut, and that it's cutting into muscle. I fear the ABC will suffer most where? In the bush. The old Nationals are signing off on cutting bush broadcasting services. Estimates last week heard that the ABC have shed 1,012 jobs since 2014, cut under the watch of Prime Minister Turnbull and Prime Minister Abbott. They know full well that this cut they are inflicting on the ABC means cuts to jobs, content and services at the ABC, particularly in the bush. The Liberals and Nationals complain that the ABC isn't doing enough news coverage, yet these hypocritical politicians have left a $43 million hole in funding for ABC news and current affairs. The ABC said the impact of the cuts cannot be absorbed by efficiency measures alone, because the ABC has already achieved significant productivity gains in response to past budget cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party claims their budget is about investing to create more jobs every day and to support essential services, yet these cuts to the ABC will inevitably lead to job losses and a reduction in the quality or breadth of service, especially damaging for those in the bush, the rural and remote parts of Australia that are too sparsely populated to sustain commercial media. Redundancies at the ABC are on the horizon as a result of the government's cuts to the ABC in the recent budget, and the reduction in ABC services that Australians value will be the consequence of the budget delivered by the Treasurer a few weeks ago. We'll have less news and fewer jobs as a result of these attacks on the ABC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will fight these fresh cuts, just as we did last year. In government, Labor gave additional funding to set up the ABC children's channel, ABC News 24 and ABC online. Now, how's that for promoting local public interest journalism? Publicly funded broadcasters like the ABC and SBS provide an important source of public interest journalism, which is critical for a robust democracy. It is why the top floor of this building, on the Senate side, is devoted to the fourth estate. I don't think any other parliament in the world has the fourth estate inside the building, sitting alongside the lawmakers, because they serve such a crucial role. They are critical. However, government funding cuts mean the capacity of publicly funded broadcasters to produce high-quality investigative content has been smashed. The Indigenous Remote Communications Association objects to the exclusion of Indigenous licenced community broadcasters from eligibility for funding from the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. The IRCA argued that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander audiences utilised broadcasting services more than print or online services for their news. Why? It's because many of them are in rural and remote areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How is it fair that large companies like News Corp can the $10.4 million set aside for scholarships and cadetships? Why are taxpayers' funds being used for cadetship and scholarship programs at large commercial media organisations? I'm a strong believer in training and skills development, but I have to ask: what's the point of cadetship and scholarship programs in a declining market for journalism jobs? Does the industry need to train more journalists when there are not enough jobs for existing journalists? These are just a couple of questions when we look at the repeal of two-out-of-three rule and what the impacts are. Job prospects for Australian journalists are growing fewer by the day. At least 2,500 journalism jobs have disappeared in Australia over the past six years, according to MEAA. Wouldn't funds be better spent creating long-term employment opportunities in journalism? Instead, the government has slashed $84 million in funding to the ABC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question is: do regional media companies have the reliable and affordable broadband they need to enable them to grow their businesses and create more jobs in the digital age? What also would be of great help in rural and regional areas would be lobbying for decent broadband. Unfortunately, the deal with Centre Alliance was not the only dirty deal done by this government to secure support for its broadcasting bill last year. Even worse than their deal with Centre Alliance was their deal with One Nation to change the ABC's charter. It is a deal clearly that is aimed at undermining the integrity of the ABC. As one of the One Nation senators has admitted publicly, this deal is absolutely a platform for fringe groups such as anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers and even more dangerous right-wing groups.</span>

The bill will implement an important component of the government's media reform package. The government is committed to assisting small and regional publishers through a time when the media landscape is in a state of flux. Traditional revenue models have been fractured, and media organisations must adapt to move with their audiences. For smaller and regional publications, this is even more challenging. In this disrupted environment, access to locally relevant, factual journalism remains vital to develop and maintain strong communities. The government's Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund recognises this need. The $50 million will provide grants over three years to eligible media organisations for projects that enable new business models and practices. By doing so the government will assist these publishers to put themselves on a sustainable commercial footing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that industry is supportive of this bill and that submissions received during the inquiry recognised the merit of developing measures to support Australian civic journalism as well as the particular need to support civic journalism in regional areas. The bill will establish the legislative framework to establish the operation of the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. The government looks forward to proceeding with a call for applications so that ACMA can begin assessing applications and distributing these much-needed funds to regional and small publishers. I therefore commend the bill to the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  There is no more important job for this parliament than making and maintaining laws relating to the safety of Australians. That's why issues to do with national security, terrorism and law enforcement are taken seriously in this parliament and usually dealt with in a bipartisan way. This is as it should be. Labor takes the same constructive approach when it comes to the critical issue of motor vehicle safety standards in this country. Nearly 1.2 million new cars are sold in this country each year. Sadly, thanks to the very conscious policy and actions of this current government, Australia no longer builds cars. We must rely upon imports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> It is critical that this parliament keeps the standards applying to motor vehicle imports up to date and fit for purpose. This legislation is timely. It is 17 years since the Motor Vehicle Standards Act and its regulations were last reviewed. The package before us seeks to bring the regulatory regime forward and make it more streamlined. Indeed, the government argues these reforms will reduce compliance costs for industry by $68 million. The legislation creates an online register which will provide consumers with an easy way to check that vehicles they are considering buying comply with Australian design standards. Labor has some concerns about the fine detail of the bills, based upon stakeholder feedback, but we will support this package. We believe that the stakeholder concerns, which I will address shortly, should be taken into account in the rules and subsequent technical and administrative arrangements provided by these bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The road vehicle safety package will replace the old Motor Vehicle Standards Act, which regulates imported vehicles. It includes five piece of legislation: the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—General) Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—Customs) Bill 2018, and the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—Excise) Bill 2018. Under existing rules, people demonstrate that a vehicle complies with safety standards using the physical attachment of a compliance plate, but this legislation replaces that system by creating a register of approved vehicles that comply with Australian standards. There'll be two ways for a vehicle to make its way onto this register. The first, known as the type approval pathway, is for new vehicles being imported into this nation for sale. The vast majority of vehicles will enter the list via this route. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second pathway, known as the concessional pathway, is aimed at a limited range of new and used vehicles which can be granted concessions on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. This pathway will apply to specialist enthusiast vehicles, classic and vintage vehicles, and vehicles that have a special purpose that could not be fulfilled if they had to comply with Australian standards. This latter category might apply, for example, to emergency vehicles and cranes. The legislation creates a specialist and enthusiasts vehicles register to ensure that motor enthusiasts, seeking to import unusual vehicles, can do so without breaching Australian vehicle standards. That is a sensible way forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, indeed, motor enthusiasts who do import vehicles. Some, such as Lindsay Fox, have imported a large number of quite unique vehicles into Australia, not for driving but for public display in his museum in Melbourne as part of his contribution to philanthropy. Lindsay Fox is certainly a contributor to the nation, and that is just one of the ways in which he uses his private wealth for public good. Hence, this register will really assist that process in the future.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation also includes provisions allowing for the importation of vehicles other than for road use, such as for testing or racing. These vehicles will not be listed on the register. Relevant states and territories will decide whether such vehicles may be driven on the roads within their borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes will serve the interests of consumers. Consumers will be able to search the online Register of Approved Vehicles using their vehicle identification number to confirm that vehicles they want to buy comply with these rules. The new legislation will also require manufacturers to introduce a secure identification marking requirement for all new vehicles. This provision is designed to provide a deterrent to vehicle theft and rebirthing. This is a sensible move.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package also gives the minister for transport the ability to issue a recall notice on any road vehicle or road vehicle component, and lays out the framework for voluntary recalls. This is another important measure. When manufacturers discover faults in motor vehicles, it is critical that there is a process by which they can be recalled quickly if they represent a risk to public safety. There have been some major safety recalls in recent years involving major manufacturers. We need a simple system that allows for efficient handling of such issues. Administration of these new standards will be funded by industry participants on a cost-recovery basis. However, these bills do not outline the amounts to be charged. These will be prescribed in accompanying rules and regulations that will be subject to disallowance by this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Various industry groups have expressed concern over elements of the package. For example, the legislation allows some vehicles to be imported through a revised Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme which allows for the import of used specialist and enthusiast vehicles. It also creates a new, low-volume scheme which applies to new vehicles where fewer than 100 vehicles are to be imported. The Australian Automobile Aftermarket Association raised concerns about the inclusion of the NLVS under the so-called RAWS scheme. The AAAA argued that, under the existing system, vehicles imported under the new low-volume scheme do not need to be individually inspected. Its concern is that, under the new system, low-volume imports will have to be individually inspected and that this will add cost to the industry. The Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme Association suggested the new arrangements would therefore disadvantage small workshops and benefit big manufacturers. Concerns were also expressed regarding the effect of these legislation on companies that import vehicles from overseas and then convert them into campervans or motorhomes. Specifically, this legislation closes a loophole in the existing system that allowed some registered automotive workshops to import thousands of cars which they did not convert but simply on-sold at a profit. This legislation's closure of that loophole has created concerns about the prospects of companies that do legitimately convert vehicles into campervans and motorhomes. Having considered these concerns, Labor has formed the view that the legislation as it stands serves the public interest, on balance. However, we do take these industry concerns seriously and we undertake to monitor the operation of the legislation and the operations of accompanying rules and subsequent technical and administrative arrangements, and if any adjustment is required then Labor will support that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, can I say that the administration of vehicle standards is a complex task. We do need a system that is simple but also allows people who want to import unusual and specialist vehicles an opportunity to do so. This legislation seeks to find that balance, and it also includes some important improvements in the cause of public safety and security, and I commend the package of legislation to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  I am pleased to rise to speak this morning on the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and related bills. I'm a bit disappointed, having come in specially to listen to the member for Grayndler, because I thought that this bill was a wonderful opportunity for those in the Labor Party to set out how they were going to get a 45 per cent reduction in the CO2 equivalent emissions from the transport sector—because that is their policy. They say the targets that we have, from Paris, of reducing CO2 emissions by 26 to 28 per cent from 2005, are not enough. The Labor Party's policy is to up those—to target a 45 per cent reduction. If they are going to have that policy, they need to come into this chamber and set out, in chapter and verse, not only what they plan for the electricity sector—and we know the plan is to copy the failed experiment of South Australia—but also exactly what their plans are to reduce the CO2 emissions in the transport sector by 45 per cent. How are they going do that? Are they going to put a new tax on petrol? Are they going to ban a whole lot of types of motor vehicles from being imported into this country? Are they going to try and take cars off people? Are they going to increase road tolls? Those in the Labor Party need to explain to the Australian public how they are going to achieve a 45 per cent reduction in the transport sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So often the debate about reduction in emissions of CO2 is around the electricity sector. We talk about a renewable energy target, but it is effectively a renewable electricity target. The electricity sector makes up only about a third of our CO2 emissions; our transport sector makes up about 15 per cent. So, yes, the transport sector is not as big as the electricity sector; it's about half. But there has been no debate whatsoever in this House, when it comes to the road vehicle standards which this bill relates to, on what the Labor Party are going to do to make those emissions reductions. Here we had a perfect opportunity, and yet we had nothing at all from the shadow minister. I would hope that, before the next election is called, the members of the Labor Party will set out in exact detail what their plans are for the transport sector and for motor vehicles, and how they plan to get that 45 per cent reduction in emissions. Otherwise, they are simply running a con on Australian consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, 2017, 1.2 million vehicles entered the Australian market—passenger vehicles; heavy, medium and light commercial vehicles; motorcycles; trailers. Most of those complied with Australian design rules. When we ask ourselves why government needs to regulate in this space and why we can't just leave it to the market, we have to be able to answer that question very clearly. The reason is: for a market to work, consumers need information. When it comes to buying a road vehicle, there are many features that you need to know when you are making that purchase decision that are not transparent or that you can't see. That is why we need to set road designs for vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also some interesting figures that I noted from the minister's speech. He noted that, when the Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Act 1989 was first introduced—it was last reviewed 17 years ago—there were 9.4 million vehicles registered on the road and we had 2,500 Australians killed in road accidents. Yes, we've been very successful in getting that down. Even now, we've got almost double the number of vehicles on the roads—almost 19 million—compared to only a little over nine million in 1989. We've been able to bring that road toll down from 2,500 to 1,300—1,300 Australians died on our roads last year. If we put that in any other context, we would need to do more. We need to make sure that the policies of this government are to do everything that we possibly can, to get every dollar that we humanly can into improving the quality of our roads, and to ensure that our design standards give us the safest cars. When it comes to a clash over whether we should go down some track of trying to achieve a 45 per cent reduction in our CO2 emissions from motor vehicles or whether we should try to make our motor vehicles and our roads safer, when we have over a thousand Australians that die every year on our roads, that is a no-brainer. It's not only the road deaths that we have. Road trauma is estimated to cost our community $27 billion per annum, yet the terrible human impact is something you cannot put an economic number or a dollar value on. So I would hope that, when we sit down and debate what we are going to do in the space of road transportation, we give absolute first priority to making our roads safer, to upgrading them and to making vehicles safer first. That should be the priority of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With that, I commend the minister for his good work on this bill. It makes some important changes which are needed, as we have seen substantial improvements and upgrades in technology, and we need to all work together in this House to make our roads and to make our vehicles safer. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  It's a pleasure to be speaking on the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and related bills. I've got to say I thought this bill was going to be non-controversial, and then I walked in on the member for Hughes's contribution. He always finds the capacity to introduce one of his wars into whatever legislation is before the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about vehicles. The bill before the House is about road vehicle standards and updating our system of national regulation. Of course, a whole bunch of this regulation occurs at the state level. The Commonwealth does have a key area of responsibility as well. In response to some of the comments made by the member for Hughes, we have one of the most open vehicle markets in the world. You can buy more brands of automobile in Australia than in just about any other advanced country in the world. In fact, it was one of the things that many of the automotive manufacturers who have now left the country and closed down their operations under this mob here used to complain about: our market is so open that it is difficult, in such a small market, for them to compete with imported vehicles, because you're able to buy just about every brand that is available in any other advanced country around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package of bills—there are five of them—is designed to replace the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. It regulates the importation of vehicles into Australia. It's been about 17 years since the legislation was last reviewed. The intent of this regulation is to put in place a more modern and updated framework to ensure that all of our road vehicles and certain road vehicle components provided in Australia meet our safety, antitheft and environmental standards. I think that's something that all Australians would think is a good thing. Nobody wants to buy a lemon. Everyone wants to ensure that there is the minimum legislation necessary that is going to ensure that you have a vehicle that is safe, that is hard to break into and steal, that is easy to trace if it is stolen, and that meets modern environmental standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills are necessary because a lot of advances have occurred in car manufacturing and technologies over the last two decades. There is also a whole range of new vehicles being imported into the country that weren't even heard of two decades ago—specialty vehicles such as environmental vehicles, mobility vehicles, campervans, cars that are manufactured in only left-hand drive and other sorts of vehicles. In my own electorate there are several car enthusiast groups. Many of them are importing rare vehicles and vintage vehicles from around the world. In fact, one of the best-kept secrets is the best automobile museum in the country—the Motorlife Museum located in West Dapto in my electorate. I encourage all members of this place to take an hour's drive south of Sydney and head to West Dapto and enjoy the Motorlife Museum. It's got some great collections. The Brabham family were very kind in donating a whole bunch of the bequeathed vehicles they had to the Motorlife Museum. In that museum you can find, and can climb all over, some of the first cars that were ever built and distributed in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn back to the bills before the House. The existing regime has become cumbersome for businesses and consumers alike. It's why there's bipartisan support for these bills. We understand that it makes good sense for us to update it. It has been adding to the compliance costs for the importers, the wholesalers and the distributors, and, of course, those costs are passed on to consumers. It is estimated that these costs total about $68 million a year. When these bills pass through the House, as I'm certain they will, and through the other place, we'll have a more flexible regulatory regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new road vehicle standards that are part of the legislation replace the physical compliance plates as the marker of the vehicle's suitability for supply in Australia with online publicly searchable databases—the Register of Approved Vehicles and the Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicles Register. The legislative package includes three bills that deal with the funding of the new scheme. It's paid for on a cost-recovery basis by the final importer or the consumer, if the cost is passed on. The actual charges themselves aren't part of the legislation, but they will be in a disallowable instrument and tabled in the other place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills also strengthen the regulatory compliance and enforcement regimes. They introduce a new range of enforcement arrangements, including infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and criminal sanctions. They will aid Australia's road safety regime by giving the minister the power to issue a notice for compulsory recalls of road vehicles and road vehicle components where necessary. We have seen this week alone the existing recall on components—passenger and driver airbags have had to be recalled—so this is something which is of keen interest to consumers in my electorate and I understand right throughout the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the bills deal with legislation around the sale, importation and regulation of motor vehicles in this country, this is an important opportunity for us to talk about a policy that should be the subject of the legislation that is before the House today. We would invite the government to take up this policy, because it's good policy which will save consumers. It's about the way that service contracts and service arrangements exist at the moment. The modern car is incredibly sophisticated, with a lot of computerised components, and the datasets that are required for maintenance and repair on these vehicles have not been shared with all of the independent mechanics who would otherwise have the skills and ability to maintain those vehicles. Labor's policy, which will require car manufacturers to share the technical information with independent mechanics on a commercially fair and reasonable term, will overcome this issue. If we were to have legislation before the House which dealt with motor vehicle safety and standards, it should deal with these sorts of issues as well. A fully rounded package which is dealing with road vehicle standards should also enable us to deal with these sorts of issues. It will save money for the consumer. And, of course, that is one of the stated aims of this bill—to save money for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, with those points, we simply say that the legislation is a lot more bipartisan than the member for Hughes led the House to believe. We think it's common sense. It enjoys the support of the House. If the government were to get on board with Labor's announcements to ensure that the datasets and the technical information which are attached to the vehicles being regulated by this legislation, consumers would save even more money than they would under the legislation which we are currently debating. With these comments, I commend the legislation to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  I thank all members for their contributions to this debate on the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and its four companion bills. The regulation of road vehicles is an important responsibility of the Australian government. In 2017, over 1.2 million vehicles entered the Australian market for the first time, including passenger vehicles; heavy, medium and light commercial vehicles; motorcycles; and trailers. By the end of this year, there will be almost 19 million vehicles registered for use on Australian roads. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What cars and other motor vehicles look like, how they operate and the technology they use is changing very quickly, and the way we regulate vehicles needs to allow for and adapt to this change. We are already seeing these changes in the global market, and increasingly in the Australian market, through the growing presence of electric vehicles, semiautonomous vehicles and even fully autonomous vehicles. The Australian community naturally expects that, in the face of such rapid change, these vehicles will be safe, secure and have greater fuel efficiency, with fewer harmful emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and the four companion bills—the Road Vehicle Standards (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—General) Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—Customs) Bill 2018 and the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—Excise) Bill 2018—will provide a modern framework for regulating road vehicles for the future. These bills deliver that modern and flexible framework, which is vital for ensuring that road vehicles delivered or used in transport in Australia for the first time continue to meet community expectations on such matters as safety, as environmental protection, and other matters, such as anti-theft measures and energy conservation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms contained in these bills will save industry an estimated $20 million in regulatory costs. The government has applied five key principles in developing this legislative package, which is designed to improve the regulation of road vehicle standards for the benefit of the Australian community. The first principle is flexibility and responsiveness, given how fast the motor vehicle is already changing and how fast it is expected to continue to change. The second principle is clarity, reflecting modern legal drafting standards to strengthen the regulatory framework whilst improving transparency and decision-making. The third principle is the choice of road vehicles for Australians. The fourth principle is the use of modern compliance and enforcement powers to improve safety and emissions outcomes. The fifth principle is the continued harmonisation of Australian standards with international standards and the long-standing policy of Australian governments to reduce the regulatory impost on Australian industry and consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first major change embodied in these bills is to establish the Register of Approved Vehicles as the record of a vehicle being approved for first supply to the Australian market. For the consumer, the register will be an online, publicly searchable database, a new resource that will provide easily accessible information—the birth certificate, if you will, for a vehicle that a consumer is interested in purchasing. From a regulatory perspective, the register will provide an accurate date stamp for when a vehicle's conformance to our national standards must be declared. This approach will save money for the manufacturer, and thus the consumer, by removing the need for a physical compliance plate. The saving is estimated at around $14 million a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Road vehicle safety is the paramount consideration in developing these bills. To advance safety now and in the future, the Road Vehicle Standards Bill has been drafted in a way that allows it to maintain flexibility to cater for emerging and future technologies in safety standards, something that has proved to be a significant challenge under the current regulatory framework. Through the powers contained in the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, the bill establishes a comprehensive toolkit to monitor and enforce compliance with vehicle standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the bill gives the minister responsible for vehicle standards the ability to issue compulsory recalls of all road vehicles. These recall provisions, modelled on those in the Australian Consumer Law, have been welcomed by the motoring and general community. The government has consulted extensively with stakeholders on these bills for the past five years. This consultation has revealed broad support for the bills. While a number of issues have been raised, they are being addressed in the rules that will be made under this legislation or in the technical and administrative details. Small automotive businesses in particular have drawn the government's attention to some instances where there is a genuine need for consumer access to specialist and enthusiast vehicles. The government intends to respond to these instances through amending the proposed rules, the rules to be made under the legislation, so as to allow suitable used vehicles to be imported for the purpose of genuinely converting that vehicle to a campervan or motorhome; the government intends to amend the rules to adjust the power-to-weight performance threshold for specialist and enthusiast vehicles; and the government intends to amend the rules to allow for the continued importation of enthusiast left-hand-drive heavy vehicles. Further, the government has commenced work with the heavy vehicle industry to arrive at expanded circumstances in which a truck can be modified before being provided to the market for specific uses. Similarly, we are refining the arrangements that apply to suspension upgrades for light commercial vehicles. These ongoing detailed improvements are technical in nature and are supported by provisions contained in these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australian manufacturers and importers of full-volume vehicles, these bills mean reduced red tape and streamlined certification processes. For Australian motoring enthusiasts, these bills mean an increased range of specialist and enthusiast vehicles will become available, and the costs of regulatory compliance will be reduced. For the Australian community, these bills mean a better regulatory system, capable of responding to the challenges of the future. They also mean improved compliance with safety and environmental standards. Ultimately, what these bills will mean is safer, cleaner and more secure vehicles for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has considered this package of bills. The committee recommended that further information be included in the explanatory memoranda to the bills. As such, I present these addenda to the explanatory memoranda to the Clerk. I thank the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for its consideration of this package of bills, and I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  This legislation arises because of the Turnbull government's incompetence and lack of commitment to the Murray-Darling Basin water plan. Coalition members have never been enthusiastic supporters of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, and it was only ever achieved because of the leadership and hard work of the member for Watson in 2012. It has always been my concern that a future coalition government would gradually scale back the plan, or drag out the implementation of it, particularly the environmental returns and the additional 450 gigalitres of water that was to be allocated at the request of South Australia. My concerns have proven to be justified. That was particularly the case when former Leader of The Nationals and member for New England was given ministerial responsibility for water and for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. He had no interest in delivering the Basin Plan, and that became abundantly clear from the outset. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australian Labor MPs and senators flagged our concerns at the time that the member for New England was appointed the relevant minister. We anticipated that he would not support the plan as it was proposed by the member for Watson when it was implemented. South Australians never expected a fair Murray-Darling Basin deal from the coalition government, but nor did South Australians expect the level of mismanagement and incompetence that has brought us to this legislation. The only reason this legislation is before parliament is the Turnbull government's incompetence, and, quite frankly, the Turnbull government's indifference to the plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program alleged water theft in New South Wales, the Turnbull government refused to back a judicial inquiry. That would have been the only inquiry that would have got to the bottom of what was really going on with respect to water theft across the basin. It seems the government didn't want the truth about the water theft to be revealed. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program claims proved to be correct and subsequently, I understand, charges have been laid against several irrigators. Even worse, however, the New South Wales Ombudsman issued a damning report against Water New South Wales. How water theft could occur without being noticed by Water New South Wales is beyond comprehension. But, even worse, Water New South Wales wrongly claimed to have issued 105 penalty infringement notices and to have initiated 12 prosecutions between July 2017 and November 2017, when in fact, I understand, no such actions had ever been taken. Whatever water theft has taken place, we will very likely never know the full extent of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The mismanagement is not limited to water theft alone. There are also allegations that, under the watch of the former minister, water purchases were made by the Commonwealth at above-market prices or for water that can never be delivered or even measured. These are serious allegations that involve tens of millions of dollars. An article written by Anne Davies and published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> on 2 March 2018 reports on those allegations: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of Australia's largest cotton companies, Eastern Australia Agriculture (EAA), sold water rights to the federal government in July last year for $79m and then booked a $52m gain on the sale.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The deal, which was done without tender, will raise questions about whether the government paid over the odds for the water in southern Queensland.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Details of the water buyback were released to the Senate … The documents included valuations by Colliers International, which were used by the Department of Agriculture to price the water from EAA.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In one unredacted comment, Colliers warned "there is no true market" for overland flows—the type of water rights the federal government was proposing to purchase—and that "trading was limited to sales only to the commonwealth". It warned valuing this sort of water was "very complex" because sellers were likely to seek compensation for associated structures used to harvest the water.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The documents also raise the question about whether Colliers, the valuer, had a potential conflict of interest. Twelve months before, in September 2015, it had been retained to sell EAA's two huge properties in Queensland—Kia-ora and Clyde.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are murky deals, overseen by the member for New England when he was the water minister, which I believe the Australian National Audit Office should investigate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It appears that the New South Wales government is now attempting to legitimise the capture, storage and ownership of overland water by issuing new licences to landowners who have been taking overland water from the basin for free. Two immediate concerns arise from that proposition. Firstly, any water taken out of the basin ultimately diminishes the amount of water that flows downstream. I know that those who support the New South Wales proposition will argue that this water was never really accounted for and that it makes no difference to the amount of water that flows into the river system. Environmentalists dispute that, and so do I. Whatever water falls in the basin to some extent ultimately flows back into the river system, whether it be underground or above ground, and in any event, acts as important environmental water for the wetlands and other environmental assets already within the basin. To simply say that this water is not relevant, shouldn't be counted and therefore does not matter to the health of the basin system is absolute nonsense. The fact that it already happens with apparently no control adds to my concerns. The issuing of licences, which in turn will have a monetary value, will trigger a rush of landowners to claim additional overland water rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, unlike other licences, where the amount of water taken is easier to manage, the measuring and regulation of overland water is near impossible to do. When a system becomes too complicated, regulatory measures are inevitably ineffective. In the future we will see further disputes about how much water was taken, whether the person or landowner who took it had the right to do so, and what impact it has on downstream farmers. I understand that, as a result of those propositions, downstream farmers are already expressing concerns about what water may ultimately flow to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parliament should not waver from its commitment to delivery of the basin plan in full as proposed in 2012. The livelihood and security of over two million Australians depend on that basin plan. I understand that around 35 separate projects have been identified that can deliver the water savings that in turn can then be returned to the river to achieve the ultimate 2,750 litres we'll be looking at and subsequently the additional 450 gigalitres. I accept and understand that it will take some time to implement those projects, because they require the expenditure of funds and the carrying out of considerable works, but there is a proposition that those works will deliver the plan as it was intended. Labor supports that pathway, but if the water savings cannot be made then other alternatives will have to be considered. No Murray-Darling Basin community will ever be spared if the basin is not sustainable. What is required with respect to management of the basin is common sense and fairness to all, regardless of which part of the basin they live in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For South Australia, being at the end of the river system, delivery of a sustainable basin plan is absolutely critical. Since Federation, South Australia has been negotiating with upstream states for a basin plan that provides some water security. In 1969, then South Australian Premier Steele Hall publicly debated with then opposition leader Don Dunstan the merits of establishing the Chowilla Dam just north of Renmark in South Australia for the purpose of securing South Australia's water supplies. That was almost half a century ago. Premier Hall's preference was the construction of the Dartmouth Dam in eastern Victoria. The Dartmouth Dam was subsequently constructed but didn't secure South Australia's water supplies. South Australia today still faces uncertainty because, being at the end of the stream, it relies on water flowing across the border, and that water will flow across the border only if the plan is implemented in full. If it's not then we will be in the situation where we were a decade ago, where no water whatsoever was flowing out of the mouth of the river system into the sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The basin plan was agreed to in 2012 after a gruelling process—a process which included a committee of this parliament, which worked for six months. Indeed, I was a member of that committee. We travelled around the basin and met with communities right throughout it in order to try to reach some consensus. Finally, that report came back to parliament and the minister acted on it with the legislation that was ultimately agreed to by this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a gruesome process, but we achieved a plan. That plan must now be implemented, and it should not be undermined in any way, because it is the plan that remains our best hope of long-term sustainability for all basin communities. We accept that the basin communities are an important part of the nation's economy. We accept that so many communities depend on a sustainable plan. We accept that so many families rely on a sustainable basin plan, but we also accept that we have national environmental assets that also rely on a sustainable basin plan. That's why it's important that we remain committed to the plan, and why Labor has agreed to support this legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment Bill 2018. I'm pleased to hear that the Labor Party are moving to support this legislation, because that wasn't the case as little as a month ago. Prior to the South Australian state election and the Batman by-election, the Labor Party took the view that it wanted to oppose this legislation, purely for political reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that—we understand that they wanted to change their mind when they were battling the Greens in Batman. We understand that when there was a state election the Labor Party wanted to take a different view, irrespective of what that does to the more than two million people who live along the Murray-Darling Basin. For Labor to be chopping and changing their view on water policy, irrespective of that, we now arrive at the situation where this bill, based around the correction in the Northern Basin Review, is going to be put through the parliament, supposedly with the support of Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have with the Northern Basin Review is a plan that was implemented as part of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in 2012. Here we are now, six years later, where we have had the review handed in, looking at the damage that was caused to some of those southern Queensland and northern New South Wales communities, very clearly acknowledging that we have taken too much water out of productive agriculture and that we have caused too much damage to those communities. In doing the research, it was acknowledged that there needs to be a correction from the environment back towards productive agriculture to the tune of 70 gigalitres. Instead of taking 390 gigalitres out, it was recommended independently that we take 320 gigalitres out and that there be a 70 gigalitre correction towards productive agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the report that the Labor Party let hang for 12 months without one word of criticism. Then the Greens political party started playing politics with a disallowance and, all of a sudden, the Labor Party started supporting that. Now that it's been corrected and it looks like it's going to be passed through the parliament, at least that's a positive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next thing we have to work through are the 605 SDLs, effectively looking at the 2,750 gigalitres—the amount of water that has been set aside for the environment; taken out of active agriculture and put toward environmental outcomes. Again, it has been scientifically and independently observed that we can actually save 605 gigalitres out of that 2,750 because we can find smarter and better ways of reaching these environmental outcomes. We can use science and technology to create exactly the same outcomes, if not better outcomes, and actually use 605 gigalitres less to achieve the same outcome. We hope that in the next short while it will also be passed through the parliament here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It then leads us to where the previous member, the member Makin in outer Adelaide, again stands up in this House and puts the view of the South Australians in relation to water. 450 gigalitres was the amount that was the so-called 'up water'. We hear Labor saying that they want to have the plan delivered in full. I agree with them: let's deliver the plan in full. But when you want to deliver the plan in full you have to apply a social and economic test—a social and economic benefit or neutrality test—to the 450 gigalitres. We have to make sure that the social and economic test actually has the first part of that test in it—that is, the social side of things. When you read what's in the actual Murray-Darling Basin Plan, when it talks about neutral or improved social economic outcomes, the filter that they have on this is impossible to read. It talks about what fits within the neutral or improved socioeconomic outcomes, and it states in 7.17 (2) (b):</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are talking about on-farm and off-farm water efficiency projects, and:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(ii)      alternative arrangements proposed by a Basin State, assessed by that State as achieving water recovery with neutral or improved socio-economic outcomes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in all of that, it is totally ambiguous at to was to what is socio-economic neutrality or benefit. And yet, this is the actual point that will come down to deciding how this 450 gigalitres of up water is somehow miraculously delivered to the environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What nobody is prepared to do at the moment is actually say, 'What is the socio-economic cost of having communities go without water so that water can become an environmental flow?' Recent studies on the Murray-Darling Basin, in the southern Basin, look at the job losses associated with the loss of water. We can talk about the Mildura region to start with. Since the start of the Basin Plan, Mildura has had a loss in irrigated production of 38 per cent of its employment; in the Merbein region, irrigated production employment figures are down by 50 per cent; in the Swan Hill region, irrigated production decreased by 53 per cent; in the Kerang-Cohuna region, irrigated agricultural production employment figures have decreased 43 per cent; in the Pyramid Hill-Boort region, employment in irrigated production has decreased by 66 per cent; in Hay, employment in irrigated production has decreased by 41.4 per cent; in the Shepparton region, employment in irrigated production has decreased by 41.6 per cent; and in the Kyabram-Tatura area employment in irrigated production has decreased by 41.6 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when you have a plan that has taken water away from communities and you can see very clearly the amount of job losses associated with taking that water away from productive irrigation and the flow-on jobs associated with those losses in employment, it becomes a sad state of affairs—when you have one side of politics, the Greens and Labor, who refuse to acknowledge the social cost of losing that amount of water and who refuse to acknowledge the cost of having those job losses—unless somebody is able to rewrite the social and economic detriment and the social and economic neutrality clauses in a way that means we actually have to go in there and look at the socio-economic costs. We actually have to go in there and look at the social and economic costs, because, when you read the plan in the way that I just read the plan, what it says is: 'We've got this social and economic benefit or neutrality test,' but in the definition it's just an economic test. They're more or less saying that if you wish to have a million dollars' worth of water and you sell it for a million dollars and run away and go and do something else with that million dollars then everybody's happy. But what we have seen, with previous Labor policies, are indiscriminate buybacks, where they simply go into the market and buy water at the cheapest rate possible. People are always going to find willing sellers—especially in industries like the dairy industry at the moment, which is under severe pressure. The governments of Australia are always going to be able to find willing sellers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To think that you can have no community pain, loss, or detriment is absolutely farcical. It's incredibly disrespectful to the irrigation communities—the two million Australians who live up and down the Murray-Darling Basin—because those irrigation communities rely on agriculture. They rely on the farmers making their revenue, so that those farmers can then come into the cities, towns and community centres and buy the services and goods that they need, so that that money can swim around in the communities in the way that we all know it does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, what we have at the moment is uncertainty, because nobody is prepared to acknowledge that there is this filter, this rider, associated with another. What we've just read out are the job losses, already, in the respective regions, and the hurt and pain associated with those job losses. What we're looking at now is actually inflicting further pain and further job losses because we don't want to understand that there is so much hurt and detriment to communities when we take water out of those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need, as a collective, to start putting people ahead of politics. We need to start putting people's opportunity to make a living ahead of this out-and-out push for a quantity of water. When is the environmental movement—when is the Labor Party—going to start talking about environmental outcomes instead of talking about an amount of water? We have to go to the environmental movement and say, 'We're happy to sit down and talk to you about environmental outcomes. What are the major environmental outcomes that you want to achieve, not just for South Australia but for the entire Murray-Darling Basin?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The environmental movement have been poisoning all irrigators because of a <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> show that suggested that there were people in the north of the Murray-Darling Basin who were stealing water. Well, they've been charged, and they'll get their opportunity to defend themselves in court. But let's not tar all of the irrigators along the Murray-Darling Basin with the same brush, because the vast majority—99.99 per cent—have never been charged, and never will be charged, because they're totally law-abiding irrigators who simply follow one of the most honourable professions ever invented: they grow food and fibre from nothing and they sell that food and fibre, hopefully, for a profit. But at the moment, it seems as though all irrigators are potentially being poisoned by an argument that wants to see all irrigators through the lens of: 'They are people who just steal water and effectively ruin the environment in the process.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said many times in this House, water policy is the most important issue for my electorate. We need to put a proper social and economic filter across the remaining 450 gigalitres of up water. We heard the previous speaker speak in disparaging tones about the former Leader of the National Party, Barnaby Joyce. Barnaby Joyce wrote to the then minister in South Australia asking him: 'If you know how we can deliver these 450 gigalitres without causing social and economic hurt and detriment, even to your people in South Australia, then you tell me how you can do it. If you think there's a way that we can get another 450 gigalitres without hurting all of these irrigation communities, you tell me.' That's why he knew that the then minister of South Australia—and thank goodness he's gone—was absolutely holding the progress of this plan up simply by being obstinate and pig-headed, swearing at people with profanities in front of all types of people in the main street of Adelaide when he didn't get his way. That was because he thought that South Australia was being poorly handled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When are the environmental movements in South Australia going to start talking about environmental outcomes instead of talking about this quantity of water. At the moment, we have environmental outcomes like that they want to keep the Lower Lakes fresh. Well, the Lower Lakes were never fresh naturally. They were only fresh when men put the barrages in back in the thirties. That is not a natural outcome. They want to keep the Murray's mouth open. Again, it is not a natural outcome. If you leave the river to nature, the mouth closes over in most dry stretches and then it reforms or reopens itself again at the next flood. Flushing the lower reaches of the Murray River is a fantastic objective. If we can have environmental water assist with that, then we should do that. But we can't just go down this path where we want to talk about a quantity of water that causes so much pain to communities without having environmental outcomes that can be achieved.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the normal course, the government would not be able to simply reissue that instrument. The Water Act 2007 doesn't allow it without going through a full, fresh process of consultation. Given that the negotiations ultimately were concluded in a positive way, Labor now stands ready to support this bill without amendment and to facilitate its passage through both houses. To that end, I'm not even moving a second reading amendment. This is something that is the product of a direct negotiation with the government and something that we therefore support in full, without compromise and without question.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was listening to the speech from the member for Murray just before me. I do believe he has faithfully put forward views from his electorate. They are views that I certainly heard in a series of community meetings during the time that I was water minister, which were put with equal passion by members of his community and sometimes with language that was somewhat more forceful and, occasionally, using a series of adjectives that he referred to a previous water minister from a different state as having offered at different times. There's a reason why there's real passion on this issue. It's because the situation that Australia has found itself in, after 100 years of the Murray-Darling Basin being managed as though it were not connected, has meant there is no ideal solution for anyone or any interest up and down the basin. Every step forward has meant compromise. That is a reality of what is in front of us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've come in today with a copy of the Basin Plan. It was being quoted in the previous speech, and I said, 'Quick! Grab me a copy. I want to walk in with it.' If I were to write down my ideal solution for the Murray-Darling Basin, this would be not be it. If I put forward my ideal solution for how to deal with the Murray-Darling Basin, the simple answer is that we would have ended up without a plan, and we would have ended up without any national system to be able to get specific targets that we would work towards. This was not a document that I started with or that my department started with or even that the authority started with. We all remember the document that the authority started with. I'd been water minister for a couple of minutes, and the guide to the plan appeared, and I discovered that instantly I was being burnt in effigy all around the basin by different communities that had an understandably strong—</span>

                    </a>  You used to be responsible for my safety! I'll remember that interjection. But the Basin Plan meant that, when we got there, it ended up quite different as a result of a series of community meetings, small meetings and consultation, where I don't think anyone would argue that the consultation was anything but real. People saw the document change as it went through and saw, effectively, the architecture of a critical compromise. Two parts of that compromise were, in fact, the subject of the different disallowance votes in the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were three major moving parts. The first was the Northern Basin Review. I ordered that there be a Northern Basin Review, and I'll be honest: what the authority came back with were numbers that surprised me on the extent to which they changed what the earlier advice from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority had been. It didn't surprise me, though, that the numbers had changed. When Craig Knowles headed up the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, we talked about it at some length. The south of the basin—and those members here in the chamber who are from basin seats all know this backwards, but I'll explain it for the benefit of the House—is highly regulated. For water to flow, it's being released from dams and weirs. There'll be an extent of flow, but largely we have in the southern basin a river system that is now, in many ways, a set of interconnected dams and weirs. That's largely how the water works. In the northern basin you have a much flatter system and a system where, when there's heavy rainfall, it flows and, when it flows, every time much of the water will flow in a slightly different fashion to how it did previous time. That is something that's seen in the southern basin when you get an overbank flow, but largely in the southern basin the water is far more predictable. That meant that, when we and the authority were determining for the purposes of the plan what the northern basin numbers should be, there was a high degree of uncertainty because, as the years of data build up, those numbers will always be subjected to new information and the water will continue to flow differently in the north. Therefore, when some people say, 'How could Labor ever support reduced numbers?' the concept of the original numbers in the north always relied on the best available data, but we wanted it reviewed because there were always going to be more questions in the north than there were in the south. That's the reason for the Northern Basin Review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, when I say the numbers came out differently to what I'd anticipated, why is Labor then supporting them? There is a really simple principle here: I believe having an independent authority is essential. We will never resolve anything in the basin unless we accept that the independent authority, when it makes a call, must not then be litigated gigalitre by gigalitre by this parliament. We've established an independent authority and, once we start litigating each gigalitre of the recommendations they come down with, it's effectively all over in terms of whether or not we'll ever have a plan for the basin and whether or not we'll be able to deliver those sorts of outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For that reason, it was important to accept that whether the numbers were what I thought they would be or not wasn't actually the point. We need to have an independent authority. They were the numbers the authority came back with, and my view was, and I made it clear, that in any negotiation with the government—I acknowledge the minister responsible, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, is now at the table—at no point were we trying to alter what the authority had recommended.</span>

                    </a>  Without turning it into question time, although I'd love a world where I was in a position at the dispatch box to answer questions from the backbench—if you want to bring that on, I'm there for it. Why did we disallow it? As I explained earlier—you might have been reading, but you were here in the chamber, Member for Murray—because at that point the negotiation had not been concluded with the government and I came into the chamber, immediately after the disallowance vote, and reported to the chamber our willingness to deal with it again. It is only possible to deal with it again in the exact same terms by pushing this legislation through both Houses. We are here for that, with no amendment, not even a second reading amendment. Any further questions, I'll be here at two o'clock.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next part is about the compromises, effectively, within the plan—you've got the Northern Basin Review, and then there were two other areas where the numbers that were put forward in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan were seen to have to possibly change in the future. One was the 450 up; the other was the 650 down. I'll deal with the 650 down first, because we had the disallowance on that not long ago. The plan specifically allowed for there to be an alteration of the numbers in the plan by up to 650 gigalitres if—if—states could put forward projects which, on completion, were viewed to deliver the same environmental outcome with less water. So when people have said, 'Well, where's the Labor Party on issues of getting the same environmental outcome with less water,' the entire 650-gigalitre flexibility within the plan was exactly that. It was put in that for that purpose. And when some from the environmental side said, 'How on earth could Labor not vote to disallow that regulation,' it was foreseen. We would not have had a plan if we hadn't put that in. I want to pay credit to Peter Walsh, who was the Victorian water minister at the time. His coming forward with this part of the plan was an essential part of brokering the entire agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But make no mistake: you don't get identical environmental outcomes with these projects. You get equivalent outcomes, taking into account some very specific and limited definitions within the plan. The simplest example I can give is something like Hattah Lakes. It's a beautiful environment site—I've gone kayaking there; you kayak when the water is there, through the river red gums—and it's quite a spectacular place. It naturally would have got its water from overbank flows, overbank flows that occur much less regularly because we have irrigation districts and dams. That's why the overbank flows occur much less regularly. There are two ways of getting the water there: either you release Commonwealth environmental water from dams, a large amount all at once, and get the overbank flow on its way to Hattah Lakes—it floods every farm in the way and takes out whatever they might have had in the ground so that by the time it arrives at Hattah Lakes it's picked up whatever chemicals and nutrients were in the farmland and deposited that at the environmental site—or you use a much lower amount of water, still environmental water, and you pump it there directly. You get a similar environmental outcome—not identical; there will be small environmental sites along the way that get no water because it was piped—using a fraction of the water that would have been required through an overbank flow. They were the sorts of projects that were envisaged in the 650 gigalitres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only today, the Nimmie-Caira project has been reported. I have shared some articles. It was reported on the ABC last night, and I saw it in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> today as well. The Nimmie-Caira project was advanced by New South Wales. A series of property owners wanted to get out, and they were happy for their land to be managed for environmental purposes. As a result, in the irrigation districts, particularly in areas like Griffith, it's made a significant difference. The water for the environment that is required will be much lower as a result of what looks like the particular success of the Nimmie-Caira project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give credit to the former water minister for New South Wales Katrina Hodgkinson. She brought this project forward. When she first brought it forward, there was some hostility from within the Commonwealth about it. I went through some extensive briefings with New South Wales. I thought there might be a way of making it stack up. I asked Commonwealth officials to look at it more closely. They went through it, and we've ended up with a significant project that has now been welcomed by environmental groups as well, regardless of all the hostility at the beginning. Also, I might add, the Nari Nari Tribal Council will now play a major role in the management of the property.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within the basin, this will become an iconic environmental site, I suspect. It needs active management. I understand that there's been a significant problem with wild pigs in the interim while the management arrangements are being sorted out. These are the sorts of projects where the plan, through its entire structure and through that availability of 650 gigalitres being made through other measures, is allowing environmental outcomes in ways where you obviously still need some water but less water than you would otherwise need if you were only relying on overbank flows. So when people argue—and it's representative of what comes out in different communities—'Why is it only water that's being demanded?' it's not. That flexibility was in the plan. I might add that the plan allowed flexibility of up to 650. The regulation that has come back from the authority and signed off by the minister only took that to 605.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to whether all these projects ultimately stack up, there's a reconciliation process that happens, from memory, in 2024 or thereabouts to determine whether or not the projects have delivered the outcomes that were envisaged. A lot of these are major engineering works, and all projects of this type vary during the time. Some of them may turn out with better outcomes and some of them may turn out with worse, but that verification will happen. If they end up falling short, I will be clear for the sake of transparency, and I've said it publicly before—and this is not a shared view across the chamber, but the plan allows this sort of flexibility anyway. If there is a gap—and there might not be—Labor would bridge that gap through buyback. The government would have, as I understand it, a different approach in bridging that gap. I think I've represented everyone's positions accurately on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area of flexibility is the 450 gigalitres up. I previously described the 650 down. We would not have got the agreement from the irrigation communities or the upstream states were it not for Peter Walsh advancing that. In the same way, we would not have got the agreement from South Australia were it not for the additional 450 gigalitres of what's often referred to as up water. Even though we disagree on the simplicity of the clause, I was pleased earlier that the member who preceded me, the member for Murray, read out the full clause, because often the Basin Plan has been misrepresented in this place and people have said that the only test is that, if you want to get this extra 450 gig, you need to do it in ways where there are no social or economic downsides, whereas the plan is quite specific in adding that if you do it through the voluntary participation of irrigators in improving their on-farm infrastructure—if that's the method of acquiring the water—then that will be taken as evidence that there were no social or economic downsides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was put there for the 450. The 450 has been in doubt for some time. In dealing with Australia's minister for water, I made clear that we did need to be able to see progress on the 450, because, just as there would have been no plan without the 650 down, there would have been no plan without the 450 up. And a sensible way through on this always involves that challenge—which this building historically hasn't been great at and probably over the last decade has been worse at than it used to be—which is finding an outcome where everybody accepts some compromise, because we know that's better than having no outcome. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay full credit—I won't overdo it, because it won't help him—to the minister for water. There have been compromises for each of us in working this through. But what has happened is that we have now faced the moment where the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was ready to fall apart and we have made sure that it didn't. That is a critical thing and something that will be a lasting legacy for the work that he does as a minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should take the House through some of the elements of that agreement and I should let the minister know that, before he got here, I said, 'We're not going to move any amendments, and I'm not even moving a second reading amendment—not the normal sledge that we put in; there is that much cooperation. But a lot of the elements of the agreement won't otherwise come before the parliament unless they're explained, and I think a lot of this happened in the minister's second reading speech as well. Six areas are covered: strengthening of protection of environmental flows, strengthening compliance with basin water laws, improving confidence in northern basin review data, strengthening the SDL adjustment mechanism, improving outcomes for First Nations Indigenous people, and addressing the social and economic impacts of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, on strengthening the protection of environmental flows, this wasn't really questioned in a big way until the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> revelations last year. These were revelations that alarmed pretty much everybody except those who were responsible for them, because water theft isn't just doing the wrong thing by the environment; it's doing the wrong thing by your neighbour. It's doing the wrong thing by all the irrigators up and down the system who keep to the rules. The allegations we saw were serious allegations of water theft. The Australian taxpayer has spent an extraordinary amount of money on environmental water. It now stands as a very significant Commonwealth asset—a very significant asset. The concept that what was designated environmental water to be flowing down the system was being pumped back up into someone's dam alarmed everybody who believes in keeping to the rules. And I include the vast, vast majority of irrigators in that. But it did put forward a demand, as these negotiations went through, that we needed to be able to provide that confidence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole plan is underpinned by what came before it. I wouldn't want this speech to presume in any way or for people to think that all of this began somehow with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan being put in place. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan wouldn't have been possible were it not for the Water Act. The Water Act was brought through by a water minister who's now Prime Minister of Australia, during the time of the Howard government. That wouldn't have been possible had there not been years of negotiation with the states through a ministerial council that was established under the Keating government. This issue was raised in the Federation debates. Only then, the South Australian issue, when they were raising it, wasn't for the purposes of the environment; it was actually a navigation issue, because they could no longer get the vessels upstream. All of this work has a very long history to it, but it's all now underpinned by the concept of there being a water market—a market where you can trade back and forth and you know what you have purchased. When the Commonwealth purchases environmental water, it knows that it will be used for environmental purposes, not be pumped back into somebody's dam. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The agreement includes mechanisms to protect those environmental flows, and I've had good meetings with the New South Wales government and their minister, Minister Blair, in seeing progress there. There is still more work there, but there is significant progress in goodwill, which I want to acknowledge. There is also the establishment of a Northern Basin Commissioner, which I know the minister has been continuing to work on and which will allow there to be an independent person. Why do we need this in the north and not in the south? For the reasons I referred to previously: the extent of regulation in the south means that what we saw in the north—well, I certainly can't imagine how somebody would be able to do something like that in the southern basin, but a Northern Basin Commissioner makes sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strengthening compliance with basin water laws: the government will implement the key outcomes of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's review of compliance and enforcement. New South Wales has committed to the implementation of the Water Reform Action Plan and we've got the development and delivery of a Basin Compliance Compact. The new Northern Basin Commissioner will also monitor and advise on implementation and compliance commitments. The government is also committing an additional $20 million, which will help with monitoring, metering and measurement. I think a lot of people in the southern basin were astonished at how many things that had just been part of living in the southern basin were yet to be there in the north because of the hydrology, because it's so flat and because it's not a regulated system in the same way.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I were to point to anything being a key weakness that I would have liked to have secured in the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan and that I failed to secure—that I wasn't able to deliver on—and which I've got to say will be to the credit of this minister and this government in securing, as a principle, it is about First Nations people in both the northern and southern basin. For a long time they have been arguing that they didn't only want to have a right to land in different sites but the land didn't have its full meaning unless there were also some rights to flow—some rights to water. The government has done this for the first time. I'm not sure about the extent to which other countries have done this yet internationally—I don't know the answer to that. But this is certainly groundbreaking in our history, and I suspect, globally, that it's not something that a lot has happened with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept of cultural water will now exist, and money has been put forward for various groups to be able to have their own entitlement to water. It won't be owned by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, it will be owned by them and used by them, and they'll make decisions about how annual allocations are used. I won't know how; I'll find out after the event. They'll make their own decisions on that, as they should. But it is a fundamental shift for those groups. Some groups, even with this, are reporting it as though it were trying to buy them off and sign them up to the agreement. It was never conditional—never conditional from the government and never conditional from us. It does mean that a step has now been taken in a direction which is groundbreaking, and I give full credit to everyone involved, including those opposite.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where I said earlier that the numbers surprised me, part of the agreement is allowing much more penetration of that data, which is important and which I think will only benefit the authority as well—that sort of transparency and sunlight.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The SDL adjustment mechanism is being strengthened in different ways, and, in particular, the government is now commencing the work on accumulating that 450. People needed that show of good faith that it was starting, and it will start. Exactly how it's got to what the projects are I don't think will ever stop being an issue of contention in different directions. But, given it had been put into doubt about a year and a half ago, having that back on the table and starting is critical.</span>

I want to make clear that it is understood—and I don't want to be accused of brushing over any of this—that none of this is easy for anyone. Even though a whole lot is being done to try to make the adjustment have as little impact as possible, none of this delivers a zero-impact outcome. For many communities that has already meant significant hardship and different challenges which communities have responded to in different ways. The alternative is unthinkable, because eventually the river turns up at the negotiating table. We might all think we're uncompromising, but it wins when it starts negotiating back. We need to have a healthy working basin. It will never be a 100 per cent natural system again. I think anyone who wants to argue that it should be a completely natural system at the lakes at the end has to argue for a natural system the whole way up, and I've never met anyone who then wants to go to that next stage of the argument. It will be a regulated system, but it can be a healthy system. It will be a system that works for the environment and for the communities that depend on it. We've now got to the moment where that was in jeopardy, and parliament is showing its capacity to deal with it, so I thank the minister.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise today to speak in the debate on this legislation, the Water Amendment Bill 2018, that has been introduced to get the Murray-Darling Basin Plan back on track. Before the member for Watson leaves, I will recognise that he is one of the few people in this place that understands water. We might not always agree on how we use it, but he does understand the process. One of the frustrations in this place is I've heard a lot of speeches made by people who don't understand water but understand the politics of water. The challenge in this place is to have science and common sense win, and not be trumped by politics. We nearly saw that happen, and I'm glad that we're back on track. I want to have that on record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are others in this building who haven't covered themselves in glory. I can point to Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who has made some absolutely ridiculous contributions during this entire time. Senator Penny Wong and Senator Cory Bernardi have also not covered themselves in glory through this whole process. The big challenge we have in here is when politics trumps science. The Northern Basin Review, which I'm probably more familiar with than the rest of the basin, due to the fact that my electorate is pretty well encompassed by that northern basin, came from several years of study, science, negotiations and inquiry by an independent committee that was set up to do that. To get to a point where it was to be implemented, and then to be trumped by the South Australian election, was deeply frustrating to me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who represents a third of the Murray-Darling Basin—I believe I would probably have the largest section of the basin in my electorate, from the Lower Darling to the reaches on the Queensland border where the Dumaresq meets the Macintyre; it's a very complex issue, and different communities in my electorate see this issue differently—it's very frustrating to come to a position on this where truth goes out the window. I have seen some absolute nonsense being portrayed on social media and even reported in the media. For example, a couple of months ago, just after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program, the local paper in Broken Hill, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Barrier Daily Truth</span>,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>ran a front-page story that said that in 2012, the water minister, Barnaby Joyce, changed the regulations in the Murray-Darling Basin system and allowed irrigators to take whatever they want. Well, in 2012, the water minister was the member for Watson, Tony Burke. Barnaby Joyce was a senator from Queensland who had no responsibility for water. I pointed this out to the editor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Barrier Daily Truth</span> and on page six the next day there was a small retraction. But the seed was sown that there was somehow large-scale government corruption in managing the river system. Quite frankly, I think the member for Watson's contribution may have put some of that to rest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To get to this point has required an enormous amount of goodwill and hard work by the states and the territories within the basin, as well as the Commonwealth, as well as the communities, as well as the individuals and the environmentalists and the irrigators right across the basin. They have put an enormous amount of work into this. For the northern review to be portrayed as a fresh grab by irrigators to get more water is a long, long way from the truth. Water reforms started in this country long before the basin plan came into action. In New South Wales, the reforms back probably 25 or 30 years ago saw a lot of water removed from the irrigation industry, with no compensation to irrigators. In some of the early stages of the basin plan, and when Senator Wong was the minister, the buying of large licences willy-nilly devastated towns. In the north-west of my electorate, the town of Collarenebri lost its major and probably only serious employer. Over a hundred jobs went with the stroke of a pen when Senator Wong purchased the water from Twynam Pastoral Company's Collymongle Station. Purchases made without taking into account the interests of the local communities are still impacting on those communities. Collarenebri, quite frankly, will struggle to recover to any form at all. It certainly won't recover to its former glory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Water is the lifeblood for everyone. The Murray-Darling Basin, particularly the Northern Basin, is not a fixed piece of plumbing. It is not something where there is a set amount of water every year and it's just a simple matter of allocating a certain percentage for production, a certain percentage for the environment and a certain percentage for residential communities. It's an ephemeral stream. The electorate of the minister sitting here next to me is a large catchment for the Darling River. From memory, it hasn't had run-off from 2012. That was the last run-off that came out of western Queensland. The water from the cyclone we had earlier this year, which is now reaching Lake Eyre, goes down through the Channel Country in western Queensland and into South Australia and is not part of the Murray-Darling Basin. A small part—one river—got a catchment and got water from that cyclone. As a result, the Culgoa River is running through into New South Wales, into the Barwon and into the Darling, and that water just last week reached Wilcannia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conjunction with the state government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, a series of environmental flows have been let go from various dams in the upper catchment to hop onto the tail of that flow to continue it for a longer period of time. To allow this to happen, irrigators in the electorate of the member sitting next to me, and in my electorate, forewent the entitlement they could have had. What frustrates me is that there is no credit or recognition from the environmental lobby that that's actually happened—that there's water now heading to Menindee from Wilcannia. Cooperation between state and federal governments, the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and irrigators is enabling that water to flow down to the river. I believe that deserves some form of recognition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deal that has been done by the member for Maranoa and the member for Watson is, I believe, a good compromise. Part of the compromise that is going to be of great benefit to my communities is the Indigenous water—the water for Aboriginal communities. Unless you go to those places, you will not understand the importance that the river has for those communities. If you go to the communities in Bourke, Brewarrina, Wilcannia and Menindee when there's water in the river, they are different places from when the river is dry. Those communities exist because of the river. I think that allocation of water will be helpful. We have now got over this speed hump in the process, which has stopped a lot of other things happening from the state governments as well. The environmentalists, in their great charge to try and blow this up, have actually stopped some projects that are of great benefit to the communities that they are supposed to be helping. I'm very hopeful that we're getting to a point where we'll see an allocation of funding for a weir at Wilcannia, which is long overdue; the re-engineering of the Menindee Lakes so that it has the ability to hold more water; the cutting off of Lake Cawndilla from the system; and the purchase of water from Tandou, which will mean that Lake Cawndilla will only fill when there is a flood. With the re-engineering, more water will be held in Menindee to provide for the communities who live in that area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of this legislation is about compliance. If there has been theft, then it needs to be dealt with in the appropriate manner. But I want to point out that <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> is not a court. <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> is a program that provides entertainment for people. It can present facts in a way that it wants but that is not necessarily balanced. I believe this is part of a larger scheme to actually attack the cotton industry in Australia, and irrigation in general. There are court proceedings in place, and I won't comment on them because it would be inappropriate. Until those findings are dealt with through the proper judicial manner, I think we have in this country a presumption of innocence until proven guilty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In defence of the irrigators and the cotton industry in my electorate, we have just seen a very, very good harvest grown on less water per kilogram of cotton than anywhere in the world—certainly much less than we would have used in that area. Part of the whole process that the member for Watson was talking about with the re-engineering of the Trangie-Nevertire scheme and the Narromine and other schemes in the Macquarie valley is that we are seeing huge yields of cotton grown, with much, much less water. The lining of the channels has reduced the wastage by up around 90 per cent. We are seeing efficient use of that water. Quite frankly, with the season we're having, the only income of those towns is coming from the water generated by the irrigation industry. There is this idea that we need to get rid of cotton in Australia. We grow cotton in Australia because we have an ephemeral system. When you've got water in the dam, you can grow the crop. We've tried permanent plantings at Bourke, and that ended up very badly because in a dry season those trees ultimately died. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to the minister, the member for Maranoa, on pulling this off. I have acknowledged the member for Watson for this process getting back on track. The communities in the Murray-Darling Basin have absolutely had it up to their back teeth with water reform. They have been going through this process for three decades now, and for it to be derailed by pure base political pointscoring from South Australia is one of the lowest, most appalling acts I've seen in my 10 years in this place. I thank the minister for getting it back on track, and I know the communities right across the basin want to get this reform done and dusted so that they can get on with their lives. Thank you.</span>

                    <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment Bill 2018, and I do so as a passionate South Australian. South Australians have held the River Murray and the river environment very close to our hearts, because we live in one of the driest states in one of the driest continents on this earth. We're at the bottom of the Murray, where the mouth is, so basically it is really important for us in South Australia, and we are passionate about environmental flows in the River Murray and the sustainability of it. As I said, we are totally dependent on the River Murray.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not that long ago that we faced one of the worst droughts that we've ever seen in this nation—and it won't be the last time either. We know, if you look at the history of Australia, that droughts occur and recur continually in this country. We in South Australia all remember the Lower Lakes, where you could basically walk across this wonderful water landscape that used to exist down at Gawler, Meningie and other places. It was devastating to go down there, to see the boats, the jetties et cetera just sitting on sand, and basically to be able to walk across from Gawler to Hindmarsh Island, a place that normally has ferries going to it, boats and all sorts of water activity. You may say that we're talking about water activities, sports et cetera, but the reality is that, if you have a good flow, you know that the river is environmentally sustainable. You know that things are working upstream. It's not just us down at the bottom end that worry about the river. We need an environmentally sustainable river that can go on to do the things that it's done for us for 200 years, for our growers and other people that make a living off the river. But we have to do it in a sustainable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been arguing for many years, as we heard the member for Parkes talk about earlier—since Federation—about getting a system in place that will ensure that we get those environmental flows and we get the sustainability of the environment, and at the same time looking after communities that are dependent on the river from up top right down to the bottom. To do that, you need a national plan. To do that, you need to be on the same page with every single state and with the users of the river—the growers, the irrigators, the environmentalists and the whole lot. For a hundred years, we haven't been able to find that balance. Since Federation, the River Murray has been the focus of a lot of debate. If you go through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span> in this House, you will see debates that date back to Federation. That shows that it is a concern not just for South Australians but for all of Australia, because without an environmentally sustainable river we'd never be able to sustain the irrigators and the growers, the people who make the food that feeds us. So it is very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we had the agreement in 2012—and we heard the member for Watson talk about it—where we resolved a hundred years of conflict, a hundred years of states playing off on other states with their own interests. When Labor put the plan in place, it was to deliver a healthy river, a sustainable river, a river that would sustain us for many years and sustain the environment for many years, which is so important. We on this side of the House delivered a plan for the recovery of 2,750 gigalitres for the environment and an additional 450 gigalitres of water for the environment from on-farm infrastructure. The plan includes a mechanism to allow that 450 gigalitres of water to be added, as well as a reduction of up to 650 gigalitres if the health of the environment isn't jeopardised. So you'd have to make sure that the health of the environment isn't jeopardised before that happens. And you need to test the plan, that it's got environmental targets that need to be delivered. You don't just pull that water out; you test the plan as well. So the 450 gigalitres came with a funding package of $1.77 billion that Labor delivered in 2012. That was part of the plan and the agreement. The funding is for on-farm water projects that provide the Commonwealth with the water and the money to remove constraints in the basin to allow the water to get to where it's required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw was the former Deputy Prime Minister put that 450 gigalitres of water for the environment in doubt, and that was a big thing for South Australians. We heard a lot of debates around that area at the time, because that was part of the agreement. That was part of the handshake agreement that had been put in place through all the negotiations that we heard the member for Watson talk about earlier. For South Australia, taking out that 450 gigalitres was a big issue. I'll go through that again: because we're at the bottom of that river, we're at the bottom of the river system, it is so important to ensure that we had those environmental flows, that we were able to do the things that we needed to do to get that sustainable river.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package of measures agreed with the government overcomes that problem by locking in that 450 gigalitres, and it's locked in again. What we had was that it was originally locked in, then it was taken out, and now we've gone back to that through the negotiations. But, through this, we've lost another five years while we've tried to get to a better place. We made it clear in our negotiations with the government that we sought the following: assurances around the government's commit to deliver that extra 450 gigalitres of environmental water, those efficiency measures; assurances that the concerns regarding the quality of projects to deliver the 605 gigalitres of environmental equivalent outcomes should be resolved; and the need for taxpayer-funded environmental water to be used for environmental purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had a comprehensive response to allegations of corruption. We all saw the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> program not that long ago about allegations of water theft in the northern basin. When you're using taxpayers' money to put all these things into place to ensure that the environmental sustainability of the river takes place for the benefit of all Australians, for the benefit of everyone who is doing the right thing, then to see this was very sad. After all the work and the negotiations that had taken place, to see these allegations of corruption and water theft was one of the low points in our history. We had so many committed people on both sides of this House working to have a sustainable plan, as well as people involved in environmental groups, growers and irrigators, so to then see this happen was very sad. One of the other things was Indigenous consultation and engagement in water planning and governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the outcomes aren't delivered then the plan itself says this will be resolved to deliver for a better environment. The plan is designed to deliver a healthy river. That's what we're all aiming for. A healthy river ensures that we are able to continue to grow our food products, continue to do what we do along the river that sustains us as a nation. That is No. 1. Without a healthy river, all that will finish and we'll have nothing to benefit—not our industries, not our food producers. Absolutely nothing, which will be devastating for the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard representations from all sides. I've heard some really good debates here today, including by the member for Parkes and the member for Watson, with some similar arguments happening on both sides. We know that some irrigators want the plan to go forward to access the funding for infrastructure projects under the programs to help deliver that 450 gigalitres of water. Other irrigators want to see the 605 gigalitres of projects to happen. And then you have others who don't want the plan at all. The debate took place across the extremities of all sides, and we saw it while this debate was going on. Some just want the 605 gigalitres for projects and not the 450 gigalitres for projects, so it's very complex, depending on what your interests are. But what we need, as I said, is a national plan that looks after the interests of the river so that we can continue in the best possible form and the best way to keep on using it for our sustainability. The Murray is just so important to the health of this country and to the nation's food security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deal that we have today will help to reverse some of the damage that has been caused, but we need measures in place so that when the next person comes along and wants to cause a bit of a ruckus or damage to this particular plan, and decides to destroy the deal, they are not able to do so. That is so important, because this plan will sustain us for the next 100 years. I suppose that my job as the member for the South Australian seat of Hindmarsh is to make sure that the horrendous impacts from the droughts that we saw affecting South Australia and most of the nation back in the late 1990s and 2000s are never experienced again—to be able to put measures in place that will ensure that we have the water required for our sustainability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I mean by that is that we need to be prepared for the next drought, because there will be a drought. There is no doubt that there'll be another drought, and we need this plan to help with that—to ensure that we are insured against the next drought that's going to hit Australia, whenever that might be. This is in addition to better environmental flows, which this plan will help with. Again, I want to thank the former Labor government and the member for Watson for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, South Australia, especially, has put measures in place for the next drought. We have a desalination plant. It gets a lot of criticism from people, but the reality is that when the next drought hits that desalination plant will be able to produce enough water for the entire metropolitan city of Adelaide—that is 1.1 million people. That will be water that won't be taken out of our flows and out of the River Murray. That is really important, even though we hear a lot of criticism about it. Measures like that may cost a bit, but they absolutely ensure that we do all that we can before the next drought decides to hit, whenever that may be, and provide water security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's only a matter of time, as I said before, when the next dramatic climate change event happens. We all know that climate change is real—I know there are others who don't believe in it—but droughts made by climate change are going to be prevalent, not just here but around the world. We need security: farmers need security and certainty, and our city planners need certainty as well. And, of course, our constituents—the people who we represent here—need the same thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I welcome this legislation to the House. I look forward to working with this parliament and others to ensure a healthy, fairer and vibrant river system. Let's be remembered here as the generation that protected the River Murray, not the generation that sold the Murray to the highest bidder to the detriment of the entire ecosystem.</span>

                    <a href="00AMN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:43</span>):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment Bill 2018. It's my pleasure in this debate to represent the constituents in my electorate of Farrer, who are primarily irrigators in the Murray River, the Murrumbidgee River and the Lower Darling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very easy to talk about the basin plan from a distance away, and I understand that every Australian feels a sense of ownership, belonging and purpose when it comes to environmental water and, indeed, to the farmers who make their living, principally, from that environmental water. Few people have lived with this debate for as long as my constituents and those in the member for Murray's electorate, and I pick those two because I think it's fair to say we have been the most hurt, the most affected and, arguably, the most damaged by water policy that has failed us for so long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am pleased that we have arrived where we are today, and I want to reflect the support of many of my constituents, the communities that rely on irrigation, for the agreement that the minister has made with the opposition to put the basin plan back on track—to deliver, principally, the SDL adjustment mechanism for the southern basin—and also to introduce a note of anxiety about what is commonly described as the '450 gigalitre up water'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the opposition spokesperson, the member for Watson, has mentioned many times, those two are inextricably linked, even though the 450 gigalitre up water was added to the basin plan in 2012. So there was a sense of concern about where this plan was heading. Then, when that measure was introduced, there was a sense of alarm. Some of that has abated, but we watch and note with interest. So that is the caution that I observe today, and I want to say that my communities are going to watch the implementation of the expressions of interest around the 450 gigalitres of additional water with great interest, and scrutinising that will be my job on their behalf.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this bill revisits the disallowance motion that was lodged in the Senate earlier this year. On 7 May, the coalition government reached the agreement, which we are supportive of, with the federal opposition, to deliver the basin plan in full and on time. The agreement will see the implementation of critical amendments arising from the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism and the Northern Basin Review. It will provide certainty to irrigators, communities, investors and the environment alike, and it will allow those communities to look to the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I travelled the electorate earlier this year and talked about the impending disallowance motion and what might happen, I think the most common piece of feedback—apart from the exhaustion that all of us reflect when we've debated water for so long, particularly those farmers who've lost water and are adjusting to a future with less water—was the uncertainty, which can cripple any investment program, particularly those as substantial as those for some of the farms in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys. The bill is a key, therefore, to unlocking millions of dollars of investment, not just to deliver those new environmental projects, important though they are, but to add value to the commodities that are now being grown very successfully. There are not just horticultural commodities, and rice, which we're used to. With the price of sheep and lambs where it is, people are actually growing pasture on irrigation, which I certainly haven't seen for many years. There is the introduction of cotton further and further south, with new plant breeding. The expansion of almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts, particularly in the Murrumbidgee, is very exciting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The successful delivery of the SDL adjustment means that 605 gigalitres less water needs to be recovered from irrigators and communities without comprising basin plan environmental outcomes. As a result, the government has all but completed the task of water recovery in the southern basin. Unlike the opposition, we all stand behind no further buybacks—and that outcome comes as an enormous relief to the communities that I represent. The successful delivery of the amendment also opens the path to recovery of an additional 450 gigalitres, as I mentioned, to achieve enhanced environmental outcomes, with neutral or improved socio-economic outcomes through water efficiency projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, we know that the additional 450 gigalitres is essentially a task for us, and that's why we are so concerned about it. We know there's lots of language around the social and economic impacts, and we see that in the context of the Murray-Darling Basin's investigations, reports and deliberations over the years, which have demonstrated how much our communities have lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't like looking at agriculture in terms of what's lost; I prefer to look at what is gained. I would never talk these regions down. They do have a bright future. But they have lost a lot of water, and they have expected that that would be it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I just want to reflect on what those social and economic impacts have been. I know that you can put substantial dollar figures on these things, and what do they really mean? But I have looked at much of where this information has come from, and it has come from the authority itself. There has been an economic loss of $120 million at the farm gate—I'm talking about the Murray Valley—a 30 per cent decrease in rice production and a 21 per cent decrease in dairy. The average climatic scenario, which is the standard reference point, suggests that taking 20 per cent out of the consumptive pool through water buyback has led to an average increase in temporary allocation market prices of $70 a megalitre. This is close to doubling what would have been the market price, so, if you're buying water, that is an enormous impost. Reducing the size of the consumptive pool by 20 per cent increases prices in average seasons from $130 a meg to nearly $200 a meg. That increases the number of years when rice growers will sell rather than grow from seven years out of 20 to more than 10 years out of 20—I'll come back to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Murray Irrigation now delivers on average around 750 gigalitres a year compared with 1,350 gigalitres prior to the millennium drought—a huge drop in water to those farm producers. The decrease in farmgate production flows on to another $77 million loss in value-add and the loss of a total of 678 jobs, with 471 lost in the contraction of irrigation itself and a further 207 lost due to flow-on effects. This represents $21 million in lost salaries across the region. There have been population declines from 2001 to 2016 of 45.6 per cent in the Wakool community, 15.8 per cent in the Deniboota community, 32.5 per cent in the Denimein community, and 20.4 per cent in Berrigan and Finley.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I certainly have always pointed the finger at Labor for these dramatic socio-economic effects. Obviously they are not totally responsible. We in this parliament all had to take the steps that were necessary under the Basin Plan and the Water Act. But the way that the Labor Party recovered water through the horrendous Swiss cheese buyback and the disregard for the fabric of the community itself was really felt in some of the areas that I've just mentioned. As I've always said, if you have to recover this amount of water, why wouldn't you consult with the communities about the best way to go about it rather than launch the sorts of buybacks that perhaps created winners in some individuals—no communities, that's for sure—but created an awful lot of losers?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with an approach where the government is paying for water is that you will have unwilling sellers but you will always have willing sellers, many of whom leave the district and therefore don't provide the jobs and the value-add. I'm concerned that with the price of temporary water as high as it is now and, indeed, the price of permanent water higher than it's ever been—we had a sale of permanent water at a water auction at the Riverina Field Days in Griffith recently, and it made $5,000, which is unheard of and, we suspect, is going to permanent plantings including walnuts or almonds; I think it was almonds—we're creating the haves and the have-notes when it comes to water. Those who have a permanent water entitlement can probably sit back every year and sell it, as some of the statistics I've indicated show, but those who have to buy it in every year are crippled by the uncertainty about the cost, the affordability and even whether they would enter the farm production process in the first place given the increase in those costs. I think that's actually been a ramification of the Basin Plan that no-one really expected. If I go back all those years to all those experts I talked to, I don't think any predicted that the price of temporary water would go as high as it has, and that does sound a note of real concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to finish with the 450 gigalitres of up water, as I said, it will be my job as the local member of the communities of Griffith, where they burned the Basin Plan, Deniliquin, where they're clearly more affected than anywhere else, and the Lower Darling, where viable, vibrant horticultural producers are looking at adjusting out so that further environmental flows can be delivered down the Darling river, to look very closely at any expression of interest that is released around the 450 gigalitres of up water to make sure that it isn't just about individuals but actually about communities, because if, in this process, we lose community trust then we really have failed. At many points along this road, we have lost community trust, but when I had the strong feedback from my constituents about the fact that the Basin Plan was back on track, and I heard the approval from both sides of parliament for that, I felt a sense of that community trust. As custodians of that we have to be really careful that we don't lose it again. If we launch any sort of approach into the basin that is seeking to capture water and tick a box that says 'socio and economic consultation and effects are neutral or positive' but they actually aren't really—if we do that and we don't do it well—then that trust will fall apart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that within the plan—and certainly intrinsically as part of the 450 gigalitres—there is a flow target at the South Australian border of 80,000 megalitres a day. Anyone anywhere in the southern basin, whether they are farmers or officials in the state or federal departments—perhaps I shouldn't say the federal department, but certainly the state department which is actually out on the basin understanding the day-to-day flow of the system—will tell you that that is completely impossible. We have to be pragmatic about this. If it can't be delivered, we have to acknowledge that it can't be delivered and South Australia has to acknowledge it can't be delivered. The opposition spokesperson on water has to acknowledge that it's unreasonable to place it there. If you have to deliver 80,000 megalitres at the South Australian border, what are you doing to the communities upstream to deliver it? How can you possibly push that water down a system with locks, weirs and the Barmah Choke—and even post the works that will be done at Menindee down the Lower Darling—and not sacrifice the farms and the communities upstream? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Effectively, the New South Wales government can't allow that to happen. The New South Wales government are the keepers of the final decisions on what projects happen on the ground. If there are genuine third-party impacts, they will wear them and they will be responsible. I know that as we get closer to this process from where we are now we will focus very much on what this actually means on the ground for riparian funding, for irrigator allocations, for the price of water and for the communities that depend so much on all of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the minister for landing the deal that we were most worried about earlier on in the year. I congratulate too my constituents for coming on board and supporting all of us with a Basin Plan that looks to a brighter future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  We have learnt a lot when it comes to water, particularly since the introduction of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan many years ago. It is true that, prior to the plan, the water wars did create a lot of uncertainty in our communities. There were those who thumped the table and said, 'You can never have our water.' There were those who thumped the table and said, 'We should completely end all forms of cotton growing or rice growing because they take too much water from the system.' We've come a long way from those days, from the days when people burnt the plan in protest. I want to acknowledge in this contribution on the Water Amendment Bill 2018 the mature role that these communities and the irrigators in the agricultural sector have played. They have said to all of their political representatives: 'We need to remove the politics from water. We need to focus on the plan and on the regions.' There's been a real acceptance and even an embrace in many of these communities of the positive impact the plan is making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the work, particularly in the southern basin region, that communities and farmers in the agriculture sector have engaged in to really modernise and reduce their water impact. It is quite remarkable when you walk on farm and see the change that is occurring. Yes, we got some things wrong. Yes, in the early days there were projects that probably weren't the best projects. But as we grow in this plan and really mature we are learning more and more about the best way to become more water efficient and to return more water to the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the opportunity to meet with rice growers and with cotton growers on farm. What you learn when you are on a header or on a picker does go a long way to really help understand where our growers and our farmers are coming from. Take cotton for example. Today they've reduced their water usage in the southern basin by about 40 per cent. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has also helped unlock water in the region. Farmers who previously did not have a water entitlement or access to water can now purchase water on the temporary water market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note that, whilst this plan doesn't look at the water market, there's work that we need to do in another space around the impact of the water market to truly ensure that it is a fair market. The idea of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is we do need to have steps in place. It does need to be a robust plan that is able to reflect changes to the environment, changes due to drought and what may or may not be impacting on our rivers. Many people may not know this, but Bendigo is one of the electorates that is at the base of the plan. Whilst we are not on the Murray, we are very much part of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Water has always been a strong concern in my part of the world. We know that our river systems do not have the same inputs that they once had to the Murray. Because we are having drier seasons, the Campaspe and the Loddon are not delivering what they have previously. There are discussions that we have regularly with the catchment management authorities in our part of the world about what we're doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been outlined, the amendment that is before us has been about us in the federal parliament coming back together in a bipartisan way and engaging about how to get the plan back on track. Nobody for a moment should pretend that this is an easy area of public policy. It isn't just about bipartisanship in this place; it is also about asking states to partner with us on how to deliver and manage the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Being from Victoria, all of you would know the comments of Lisa Neville, the water minister, who said 'not one drop more'. Lisa Neville is the water minister for Victoria and champions the best interest for Victorians. Equally, the same could be said about South Australian water ministers, New South Wales water ministers and Queensland water ministers. That is why it is so critical for us to have a plan that sits over the top of all of our states and works in collaboration. We cannot have a proactive plan that is about achieving outcomes for the system without the engagement of the states. It's just as important to have the states at the table as it is to have both sides of politics in this place at the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What also has been delivered in the plan is a commitment around the funding package to help deliver the 450 gigalitres that has been so talked about. We know that this will come through voluntary on-farm water projects with the Commonwealth, and calling for expressions of interest is the first stage. We also know, through work and conversations with the communities and the constituents engaged, that they have some innovative ways that they believe that they can help contribute towards achieving this environmental water outcome. That's the key point I was really wishing to express in this: in the years in which we've had the plan enacted, there has been real engagement, maturity, innovation and transparency that has come from a lot of the communities and the stakeholders engaged about how they can contribute and deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be honest: I've met with a lot of dairy farmers and they have real concerns in the Murray region. Some farmers—and you can't hold this against them—sold out in the early days and sold their water entitlement. This is the Swiss cheese effect that we're talking about. In a particular area, you may have lost quite a few people in the system, and then the maintenance of the system that's left is left to the few dairy farmers that might be there. That is a real concern. We have to look at transition; we have to look at how we can help those areas. You can't hold it against the farmers, some of whom were crippled with debt. The banks put pressure on them, they had a water entitlement and so they sold it. With the farmers who are now left, we need to work with them to ensure that the ongoing cost and maintenance in those irrigation systems is fair. How do we make sure that the cost of that is fair?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you look to what's going on in the Riverina, and how some of the communities in the Riverina held back a bit and then proactively engaged on how to ensure water efficiency and energy efficiency. They really, really are driving the innovation in this space. There is an opportunity. What Labor is saying is that, 'Well, we can all work together on achieving good outcomes for irrigators and farmers at the same time as achieving good outcomes for the environment.' Transparency is paramount and compliance is paramount. We need to ensure that there is integrity within the plan. There are different interests; just take the states alone. They come to this from very different places. So ensuring that we have transparency and accountability and ensuring that we have compliance are paramount.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that in the southern basin, the area closest to me, there was a lot of concern about the issues being raised on what was going on in the northern basin. There were impacts further downstream because of the reports they were hearing about the northern basin. These were starting to concern communities. That is why it's good to see the movement by the New South Wales government and this government to ensure compliance and also transparency, giving those people in the south the security and the confidence in the plan that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Metering funding is critical so that we know how much water is being used in the north. Again, it's to ensure that confidence and transparency going forward. Also, there are: having the modelling being done made available to the public; ensuring that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has the resources that it needs and the expertise that it needs; and ensuring that there is genuine peer review in any work that's put forward so that we can have the confidence in the system going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an area of public policy, as I have said, that is vexed and hard to navigate. For 100-plus years we've struggled with it as a country. It's one of those core issues when we debate state rights. But what was agreed in 2012 really put us on the path to resolving this conflict, and only through continued engagement and dialogue can we actually achieve and deliver what is necessary to keep the health of our river and our river system, not just for today but for future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also great to acknowledge that in this set of reforms there is funding to assist our First Nations in the north and south basin to acquire water entitlements for cultural reasons. Cultural water is important. I know the engagement with our First Nations around the Gunbower area has really helped to drive changes in how the water is managed by the catchment management authority. It might surprise some environmentalists, but quite often the farmers and the local elders were on the same page about when the water should flow through the Gunbower network and systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a lot of those lessons, and I think that the point I'd like to end on is that the plan exists to restore health to the basin for all of those reasons: economic, social, cultural and environmental. We can all coexist. It is about open dialogue; transparency; supporting a just transition and funding towards those areas; encouraging innovation; and supporting the good work that's being done and building on those lessons. I understand that those opposite do sometimes like to reignite the wars for political reasons, but that doesn't do much to really help the situation. I do want to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by the minister to rebuild the bridges in those areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, not all of the members on the other side come to this debate with that level of maturity. The member for Murray should really reduce the politics in this space and get back to being bipartisan and working with all parties to deliver a just transition in his area. Our agricultural communities and our regional communities have so much opportunity. We do need to work with these areas to ensure that we have strong investment and that so that there is a plan for these areas going forward. Just seeing some of the transformations going on in the Riverina—there are some great things going on in that part of the world that other parts of Australia can really learn from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency and accountability are critical to the survival of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Working together in a bipartisan way can deliver on all four key factors—environmental, social, economic and cultural.</span>

                    <a href="HWK" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Port Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I'm happy to rise to speak to the Water Amendment Bill 2018. I do so as a member for a South Australian electorate, South Australia always having had a particular interest in the health of the Murray-Darling Basin, and also as a former water minister—albeit for a matter only of several weeks—and as a shadow water minister during the last term of parliament who understood, I think, the fragility of this plan and the importance of bipartisanship and agreement between the two major parties to keep on track a plan that was so hard fought.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll come to the processes that have led us to be considering this bill. The bill is quite specific. The bill allows for the Northern Basin Review instrument—the Northern Basin Review being an element of the plan—to be remade and to be tabled again in the parliament. But, more broadly, this bill reflects an agreement between the major parties, notably the minister who's at the table today and our shadow minister, the member for Watson, essentially to get the Murray-Darling Basin Plan back on track. I don't think it's any exaggeration to say that this plan was, for a period of time, hanging by a thread, and with it was also hanging by a thread the best possible chance our nation has of returning this incredibly important river system to a sustainable, healthy condition for now and the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scale of the achievement that's enshrined in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is difficult to overstate. It was incredibly hard fought and follows literally decades of disagreement and conflict around the way in which the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was managed. But it focuses on one of the most important environmental and economic assets that this nation has. About 40 per cent of the nation's agriculture is dependent upon the health of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, feeding into about $19 billion of our GDP. Those figures are probably out of date; it's probably substantially more than that now. Particularly importantly—I say this as a resident and a representative of Adelaide—it delivers drinking water for about 1.3 million or more Australians. So this is an incredibly important environmental, social, cultural and economic asset, and the scale of achievement, as I said, in finalising and then delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is really difficult to overstate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of this basin has been one of political conflict, conflict within industry, conflict between industry and environmental groups, and essentially overextraction—extraction at levels that have seen a steady, inexorable decline in the health of this incredibly important national asset. That really is the history. The present and the future have added to that level of overextraction and mismanagement, I think, of what essentially is a national asset fought over between states. Added to those pressures is now the pressure of climate change and a drying trend that you, Deputy Speaker Irons, would certainly see in Western Australia, particularly the Wheatbelt of Western Australia, but that we also see in the south-east of our continent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to remind members of some of the work that the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO have done around rainfall and stream flow rates in the south-east, including in the Murray-Darling Basin area. The bureau and CSIRO publish every two years what I think is an incredibly important, user-friendly report called the <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the climate</span> report. In the 2016 <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the climate</span> report there was a particular focus on rainfall and stream flow rates in those key growing regions of Western Australia, or the south-west of the continent, and the south-east of the continent, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin. I just want to remind members a bit about what the CSIRO and the bureau said is happening in those regions to add additional pressure to the pressures that have been on this system, on the Murray-Darling Basin, already for many years because of overextraction. In their report of 2016, the bureau and the CSIRO said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has been significant drying across southern Australia, especially across the cool April-October growing season—</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">which is a particular pressure on our farming communities. The report said:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The recent drying across southern Australia is the strongest recorded large-scale change in rainfall since national records began in 1900. This decrease, at an agriculturally and hydrologically important time of the year—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">is associated with a trend towards higher mean sea level pressure in the region … A known response to global warming is an increase in mean sea level pressure across southern Australian latitudes … This means that years with lower-than-average growing season rainfall are expected to be more frequent than in the past.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">which obviously takes in much of the basin—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps more important for irrigator communities than rainfall data, though, as the minister would appreciate very well, is the streamflow—the amount of the rainfall water that actually reaches the river system. The bureau and the CSIRO particularly focused on streamflow rates, which are dramatically down in the south-west of the continent, in your state, Deputy Speaker—I won't go into that, because it's not covered by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—but also down very dramatically in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The report says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reduction in rainfall across southern Australia is amplified in streamflow.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, rainfall needs to be sufficient to saturate the ground before rain then flows into the river systems and is available to irrigator communities. The agencies say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the mid-1990s, streamflow in the southeast is around half the long-term average. During the same period—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">since the mid-1990s, obviously—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">streamflow in the Murray-Darling Basin was 41 per cent lower than average and in some basins in the west and central regions of Victoria, such as the Campaspe Basin, streamflows have declined more than 70 per cent.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we were not able to start to get the controls on extraction in the basin that you see in the plan, these pressures would arguably place communities across the river system, and the environmental health of the river itself, in perilously dangerous condition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a representative of South Australia in this debate. South Australia has been making demands since the 1890s for this basin to be managed better and better. At the constitutional conventions, as followers of these debates would know, Charles Cameron Kingston, who was perhaps the leading constitutional convention delegate from South Australia, argued that because the basin crossed then colony, and soon to be state, lines, it should be managed by a national government. It was then an incredibly important national asset, as it continued to be right through the 20th century. South Australia, as so often happens to be the case, got done over by the big states yet again. The upstream states, New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, particularly, were able to continue to extract water from the system as much as they wanted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't until the federation drought, over the course of the turn of the 19th and into the 20th century, that pressure really built for the upstream states to come to the table and start to talk about a better management system for this critical water source. That happened in 1902, only a year after the creation of the Commonwealth and really at the point where the federation drought began to break. My great-grandfather was a signatory to the River Murray Water Agreement of 1914, which resulted from that coming together. It took 12 years to get an agreement. It took us a fair bit of time, as well, to get the basin plan agreed to by the member for Watson and different states. It's always been thus. It took 12 years to get the River Murray Water Agreement of 1914 signed, which my great-grandfather signed on behalf of South Australia. It resulted in significant infrastructure being built—locks and weirs in the river system—and secured minimum monthly flows to South Australia from upstream states.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there really wasn't much progress from then. For the following 100 years there was not much progress whatsoever in a system that would better manage this critically important economic and environmental asset. Since that time, it was essentially a matter of ongoing dispute between the different states, particularly with South Australia, as the downstream state, feeling that it was in a fight against Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Water reform did progress under prime ministers Keating and Howard. Internationally, I think our water market arrangements are seen as some of the best, some of the really exemplary water market arrangements anywhere in the world. But we weren't able to translate that foundation of a water market into better management for the basin until the member for Watson was able to finalise the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, in 2012. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan, at its heart, seeks to return the system to environmental health, because everything hangs on environmental health—industries and the health of the communities across the river system. Nothing will work if the river is not returned to environmental health. That is why we have argued against the, I think, inexplicable decision by Prime Minister Turnbull to give responsibility for the implementation plan to the agriculture ministry. This was something that Prime Minister Howard understood was not the right approach. This was something that Prime Minister Abbott understood was not the right approach. For some inexplicable reason, only able to be explained by base politics, Prime Minister Turnbull decided to give the then minister, the member for New England, responsibility for implementing a plan he had railed against year in and year out. We say that this should be a plan managed by the Department of the Environment and Energy and the Environment portfolio, because industry, communities and the environmental health of the system depend upon returning this system to a sustainable and healthy condition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The core element was returning 3,200 gigalitres, or 3,200 billion litres, of water to the system. That was the core element and the central position of the plan. For some, for example the Greens party, the perfect was the enemy of the good. They thought it should be more than 3,200, so, often true to form in these policy areas, they voted against the plan. I understand that they've been railing against it in the Senate, in the other place, over the course of the last couple of weeks. Members of the National Party, including the current Deputy Prime Minister, voted against the plan as well. On the fringes—the far Right and the far Left—there was opposition, but, fortunately for the system and for the nation, there were enough sensible heads at the centre on both sides of politics to recognise this was our only chance of returning the system to a sustainable and healthy condition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within those 3,200 billion litres was a core condition, particularly for South Australia, and that was the additional 450 gigalitres. The member for New England had made his position clear before, and since, becoming the minister with the responsibility for this plan: he did not regard that as a favourable term. He made it clear that he had no real intention of implementing that critically important part of the plan, and that has been a central element in the undermining of confidence in this plan. I want to say that that is probably the key reason why the plan has been put back on track by the minister and by the shadow minister, the member for Watson, over recent weeks. The government wasn't really committed to the plan, as evidenced by the position the member for New England had for many years about the 450 gigalitres of so-called up water. Compliance was not being taken seriously, as seen most obviously in New South Wales. And there simply wasn't enough scrutiny on the so-called SDL adjustment projects—the sustainable diversion limit adjustment projects—with the 605 gigalitres of down water. There wasn't enough scrutiny for people to have confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of those elements and all of those concerns have been dealt with by this agreement between the minister and the shadow minister. There's a good package of measures, which I think gives a much clearer commitment to that additional 450 gigalitres, linking payments for those states that have SDL adjustment projects and linking payments for those projects to their cooperation with the 450-gigalitre process of so-called up water. There's better compliance in this package, particularly in the northern basin. There's better scrutiny of the SDL adjustment projects, including through technical workshops that the authority will run with groups like the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, and, as the member for Bendigo said when she spoke before me, there's much better support for cultural water outcomes for Indigenous Australians in the basin area. I want to reiterate that this plan, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, is far and away our best chance of returning the river to a healthy and sustainable condition, and we cannot let that chance slip away.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZU" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms KATE ELLIS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  I rise to speak on the Water Amendment Bill 2018 and to once again place on the record that federal Labor will stand up and will fight for a healthy Murray River wherever and whenever we need to. It's particularly the South Australian members of our federal Labor caucus who have shown that we are passionate about making sure that we have a healthy, strong and vibrant river, and we know that that is just not possible unless you ensure that the river is healthy all throughout.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I stood in this place to make my very first speech, I made a commitment to the parliament and to the people of Adelaide that I would stand up and use my time as a member of parliament to fight for the River Murray. I'm here today to say that I intend to do that until my last speech in this parliament, because we know how critically important the river is. We know that we need to get the plan back on track, and we need to get it back on track now, which is why federal Labor have been working with the government to achieve these compromises and to make sure that the plan can proceed. We know that this plan has been worked upon for not just years or decades but a century. People have bickered about the River Murray. As South Australians, we see the result first when the Murray is not working, when consensus is not reached and when we don't have an agreement. We see it particularly in times of drought, as the member for Hindmarsh outlined to the House earlier. We also know that after a century of fighting, of different jurisdictions putting their own interests ahead of the interests of a strong and healthy River Murray, there was a historic agreement reached in 2012. We are proud that the member for Watson led those negotiations, and we are proud that it was a federal Labor government that finally saw a way forward and an agreement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That agreement was put in great jeopardy in part because of the member for New England holding the water portfolio. This is the member who famously told South Australians if they were concerned about the health of the River Murray to just move to where the water was. We have also seen some horrendous examples of water theft, of corruption and of water being diverted away from our river system. After this evidence of water theft and corruption, we saw that, once more, the National Party, particularly the member for New England, were prepared to play politics, to say one thing to the national media but to say the complete opposite in their own communities when talking to irrigators. This was particularly so following the evidence of the water theft and corruption when the member for New England was recorded saying in a pub: 'I'm glad it's our portfolio, a National Party portfolio, because we can go out and say, "No, we're not going to follow on that".' He also went on to say, 'We'll make sure that we don't have the Greenies running the show.' Today my message to the National Party, to the member for New England and to anyone who tries to stand in the way of a healthy Murray River is that there are no jobs in a dead river. There are no jobs upstream; there are no jobs downstream. We know that we need to fight to ensure that the mouth of the river stays open and that we have the necessary environmental flows to ensure that the whole ecosystem is protected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that there are some challenging elements of change for communities. I absolutely acknowledge that. But we have worked for far too long, for far too many decades, to see this plan fail. That's why the Labor Party were prepared to sit down, to compromise, to work with the government. We're really pleased with this package. We're pleased to see that the 450 gigalitres of environmental flows will be delivered. We're pleased with the commencement of recovering the 450 gigalitres through an expression of interest, that there is an assurance that the 605 gigalitre projects will be delivered by linking the payments for supply measures with efficiency measures for environmental water and that, if the 450 gigalitres isn't being recovered, the funding for the 605 gigalitres of projects won't be provided. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Murray accused us of looking at short-term politics. Let's make this very clear: the Labor Party's position is about a long-term commitment to a healthy Murray River. We fought for it, we delivered a plan, and we are not going to see the politics that is being played by some put that plan in jeopardy. We will get it back on track and we will work with the government constructively to make sure that happens. We have seen that the South Australian community and, I must say, the South Australian media, including <span style="font-style:italic;">The Advertiser</span>, have done a great job in putting pressure on members of parliament and on members of the government to ensure that this plan is delivered. But I have great fears. The draft redistribution in front of us at the moment shows no marginal seats in South Australia. I know that those opposite have only been encouraged to come to this plan because of the electoral consequences if they do not.</span>

The 12th of June this year marks the 80th anniversary of his ordination as a Catholic priest. He gave 50 years of service to his parish in Casino. Known as the builder priest, he ensured that institutions such as St Michael's Home for the Aged expanded to benefit the wider community. He developed retirement complexes comprising a total of 96 units for the over-50s. He was a strong advocate for St Mary's Catholic College, but, more than this, he gave of himself. In times of joy with births and marriages, in times of sadness with the loss of loved ones, Father Rel was there to comfort and support. He was bestowed a Medal of the Order of Australia in 1981.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had a great love of greyhounds, owning many himself. He retired in January 1992 due to ill health and he passed away in August of 1998. In 2001 a shared multipurpose facility between St Mary's Parish, St Mary's Catholic College and St Mary's Primary School was built and named the Relihan Centre in honour of this amazing man. Today, the day of his ordination, we will remember and Casino will remember Father Rel.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Listening to local radio in Tasmania on Monday, I couldn't believe my ears when the Deputy Prime Minister was pressed on whether the budgeted $400 million for roads of strategic importance would be spent on the Bass Highway in Braddon. What did he say? He said, ducking and weaving, 'Look, certainly the Bass Highway is an important stretch of road.' He goes on, 'We need to make it safe. The residents between Marrawah and Launceston would expect no less.' I welcome the statement made yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister clarifying that the $400 million would be delivered for all the highways and byways in Tasmania and not, as had been falsely suggested, just for the Bass Highway and, of course, the Braddon by-election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The morning after the budget, I said to members of the Launceston business community that this promise was a slush fund for the government without any identified projects, to be used as a re-election bargaining chip. In my electorate of Bass there are a number of projects that merit attention—projects like addressing traffic congestion on the Western Tamar Highway or the upgrade of the Sideling as a freight route to the north-east in conjunction with long-heralded irrigation projects. And, of course, there is the traffic congestion within Launceston. We need a transparent and considered approach to roads funding, not this government's deception. My good friend Justine Keay and I will fight for infrastructure for Tasmania.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  It is fair to say that Beryl Driver is a Mackellar icon. She received the Order of Australia medal, a 2013 Australia Day award. I cannot emphasise enough her compassion and dedicate to the community. Beryl is a truly inspiration woman who has given everything she has to those in need, even to her own detriment. In 1985, at the age of 65, Beryl competed in the first Variety Bash, becoming the first woman to do so. In fact, she was first woman to take an all-women crew, a feat which allowed her to purchase a $30,000 vehicle for a mere $3,000. Beryl has participated in the Variety Bash every year since then, driving a decorated 40-year-old car to rural towns so as to deliver health and educational equipment to children in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, Beryl community's service extends much further than the Variety Bash. She has used her to car deliver equipment and furniture to Southern Cross Wildlife Care, a veterinary hospital in Braidwood. She has also spent much of her time taking crockery, clothing and many other much-needed goods to a mother and child refuge in Brewarrina. Knowing Beryl has taught me a great deal about what it means to be selfless. Too often we put ourselves first; Beryl is an exception to this rule. She perfectly embodies compassion and has inspired her community to do so as well. I wish her the best of luck in her upcoming Variety Bash, especially as she will be dressed as a mermaid.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  The Prime Minister visited the Central Coast of New South Wales on Friday, and yesterday he told this House how the NDIS is changing the lives of many people. That is certainly true; it has been positive for some. But if the Prime Minister had driven just another half an hour up the M1 to my electorate, to Dobell, I could have introduced him to the 180 people who have sought my help with the NDIS. These are people who are waiting months for access to the NDIS, months to have their plans reviewed and up to a year to access supports and services. Plans are being developed with little or no input from participants. As a result, the latest NDIS quarterly report shows nearly a third of plans are disputed as they are inadequate. Too many people are not getting the services they need, and there are not enough staff in the NDIA to help them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Prime Minister was on the Central Coast visiting aged care residents, did he tell them there is no new money in this budget for aged care and that the extra 14,000 home care packages over three years will be paid for out of the existing aged care budget? There are still over 105,000 older Australians waiting for home care packages. Four-out-of-five of these people need high-care packages, as many are people living with dementia. On the Central Coast, 750 older Australians are waiting for home care packages right now. That is not good enough. This government must come clean on aged care and must fix the NDIS.</span>

As it turns out, sneaky is doctoring transcripts to hide the fact that Labor is all over the shop when it comes to borders and national security. Sneaky is sending deliberately false text messages to old and sick people, pretending that Medicare is danger. Sneaky is constantly describing hospital and school funding as being cut, when funding is actually now at record levels and growing. Sneaky is talking about fairness when the biggest new tax Labor wants to impose actually hits retirees and pensioners, mostly people on lower incomes. Sneaky is trying to divide Australians with a fake class war to excuse Labor whacking up new taxes. Sneaky is putting union bosses ahead of workers and accepting kickbacks from employers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  Chad Graham is 27 years old and lives in the Blue Mountains. He was a typical teenager, going to school, playing sport, a keen water skier and a competitive motocross rider competing at state level. Eleven years and one month ago, he was riding his week at a friend's property when had an accident and was left a C5-C6 incomplete quadriplegic. Chad went to primary school with my daughter. My memory of him is as a likeable kid with a bit of mischief in his smile. His injuries didn't dampen his enthusiasm for life or sport. He finished school, completed a traineeship in business management, got his driver's licence and got a job. He also tackled an across-Australia journey on a motorised buggy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one is smiling in Chad's home today because Chad is now housebound. In October, a request for modifications for his car was submitted to the NDIA but nothing happened for months. When the car quoted on broke down, he and his family purchased a newer vehicle. The amended request was submitted to the NDIA in January, but despite regular follow-up calls from Chad, his mum Wendy and my office, including a letter to the assistant minister earlier this month, there has been no resolution. Wendy broke down on the phone with me today. As she said, 'No-one should go through this torture with the NDIA just to get basic equipment. No-one should be left in limbo for this amount of time.' For all the good intentions, the system is failing people like Chad and Wendy. This is not the system that NDIS was meant to be. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  On Saturday, 12 May I attended the Vietnam Veterans' Federation 50th anniversary commemorative service for the Battles at Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral. Their service was very well attended, and honoured our Vietnam veterans who survived the terrible battles at Coral and Balmoral, as well as the 26 young men who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.</span>

I was honoured to be invited to participate and lay a wreath on behalf of the Prime Minister. The Director of the Australian War Memorial, Dr Brendan Nelson, also attended the service and beautifully honoured our Vietnam veterans with his remarks. I also acknowledge my local resident, Peter Geelen, who was present at Coral and who arranged a commemorative Australian Mint coin and Australia Post envelope to mark the anniversary. </span>

The 50th anniversary commemorative service of the Battles of Coral and Balmoral was no exception, and it was a fitting tribute to the longest and most sustained battle of the Vietnam War, lasting 20 days with 26 men killed and over 100 wounded. Lest we forget.</span>

He will retire at the end of term 2 this year, after 21 years of service to education and leadership positions at Immanuel Primary. Rob has served as a principal at St Paul, Blair Athol and Trinity Lutheran Primary School in South Australia, and he's also served in Queensland over the past 46 years of his service as a teacher and principal. Over this time, Rob has been active in principal associations, community organisations and the Lutheran Church. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rob has been not just a long-serving principal; I consider Rob a very good friend as well. I have dearly valued Rob's advice and support over my time in this place. He's always provided me with sage advice, particularly in relation to issues facing independent, non-government schools. Under his leadership, Immanuel Primary has gone from strength to strength, with the introduction of an International Baccalaureate curriculum and upgrades to infrastructure across the school, including an early learning centre. He has instilled values of faith, social justice and commitment. On behalf of the people of Hindmarsh, I would like to thank Rob for his support, his commitment and his service, and wish him a well-deserved retirement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  For 100 years the people of central-western New South Wales have been seeking a crossing over the Macquarie River at Dixons Long Point between Orange and Mudgee. It's a Holy Grail of unfinished road projects in the region. At present, it takes about two hours and 20 minutes to drive between Orange and Mudgee, but the most direct route is via Dixons Long Point, and, with no crossing, the only way across is straight through the river. The stories of cars and four-wheel drives getting stranded in the Macquarie is the stuff of legend. Dragging them out is also a constant source of irritation to local farmers, who are called upon to do it. An improved road and crossing at Dixons Long Point over the Macquarie would drastically reduce the travel time between Orange and Mudgee and link these regions. Two consultants' reports have recently been prepared to look at costings and cost-benefit ratios, and the findings are promising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recently announced Roads of Strategic Importance initiative has given us hope. I met with Cabonne Shire Council on Monday to discuss the reports. In June I hope to bring all the relevant councils, as well as state government representatives, together to discuss how we can get this key project cracking. If all levels of government join the effort, I believe that we can do it, but our window of opportunity is now and we can't waste it. The time for a crossing at Dixons Long Point at the Macquarie River is here.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  A number of constituents have sought my support for the Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law's blueprint for the next generation of Australian environmental law. This calls for new laws to protect our environment and to ensure that businesses and governments are doing the right thing, especially when it comes to keeping the air we breathe free from pollution. In response, I can assure my constituents that I do agree that our current laws aren't providing the right protection that our natural environment really needs. Indeed, it's self-evident that our vanishing wildlife, reefs and forests remain under threat from loggers, big developers and polluters like Adani who are damaging our living world while locking out concerned communities and ignoring international commitments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also agree with the importance of establishing a societal goal for Australia that will enhance or replace the current National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development. I urge the government to establish an independent commission to set standards, and to create an independent national environmental protection authority to ensure that not only do governments and businesses do the right thing but also that communities and individuals have the right to raise their voices on environmental issues. It is clear that the environmental situation is unacceptable. What we really need to do is to act now to protect our natural world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Australian Rules Football is very popular in my electorate, particularly at junior level. I recently met with representatives at the Whitford Junior Football Club, including President Phil O'Donnell and Ian Ferguson, to discuss the urgent need to upgrade facilities at Macdonald Reserve in Padbury to improve the lighting at the oval and extend the change rooms and storage facilities. The requirements have been driven by the growing popularity of women's AFL, with a dramatic increase in registrations of female football players over the past three years. There has also been a rise in general registrations for male players.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A comprehensive lighting upgrade on the south oval is expected to cost $209,000. In addition, quotes for extending the change rooms and facilities range between $20,000 and $30,000. On behalf of the club I make a strong case for federal funding to support the upgrade of sporting facilities at Macdonald Reserve. One possible source of funding is from the next round of the Stronger Communities Program, due later this year. I look forward to working with committee members, the state member for Hillarys, Peter Katsambanis MLA, and local government representatives Mayor Albert Jacob and Councillor Christine Hamilton-Prime from the City of Joondalup to secure the necessary funding to complete this worthy project.</span>

It will be a source of great pride for our country when that occurs. However, something we can't be proud about is the way that some of our people in the armed forces who were members of an antimalarial trial involving the mefloquine family of drugs have been treated on their return to Australia as they have tried to get on with their lives. I've been contacted by members of my old battalion, the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, when former members are struggling. I've been contacted by former members of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment and other units that served in Timor and were a part of those antimalarial drug trials. I've been contacted by widows whose partners took their own lives as a result of severe PTSD symptoms, severe depression and anxiety. The Turnbull government committed to doing something to help the men and women who were the subject of these trials, but so far we have seen very little action and that needs to be fixed, and fixed soon.</span>

On Monday I was joined by the Minister for Home Affairs and member for Dickson, Peter Dutton, to announce funding for the installation of CCTV cameras along the Redcliffe Peninsula shared pathway. Bike users, people walking their dogs or jogging will benefit. This comes out of the Safer Communities Fund. I know that safety and security is one of the main concerns of people of all ages, and I believe personally that it's important that we tackle crime, vandalism and antisocial behaviour in our community.</span>

Local police have told us what a great benefit these CCTV cameras will be because they are an effective crime prevention measure, a valuable investigative tool and a deterrent to antisocial behaviour. Families like Charl and Marlene's, and students like Nicole and her friends, Danielle and Kayleigh, will now have greater peace of mind when walking to, and home from, school. This is good news for our community that I'm very proud to deliver.</span>

It's been a great committee to be part of and I look forward to unveiling it, maybe in April next year—maybe around St George's Day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  I rise today to commend to community organisations in my electorate of Menzies and, indeed, community organisations throughout Australia, the Australian Aid: Friendship Grants, which were launched by the foreign minister here at Parliament House earlier today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are grants of between $30,000 and $60,000 for community organisations which are undertaking projects in many countries in our area, the Indo-Pacific area. I'm sure we all know of individuals and organisations who volunteer their time to go into countries in the region, from healthcare workers and doctors who spend a few weeks or even a few months, in some instances, going to countries within the South Pacific or elsewhere, through to the wonderful work which is auspiced and undertaken through Rotary International of eradicating polio throughout the world.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of programs and many other programs—not just in the health area but through land management and care and various other things—actually help to build rapport between the people of Australia and the people of the countries in our immediate region. I commend these new grants to community organisations throughout Australia. Through them, the government can help to assist the valuable work that they do in our neighbourhood.</span>

It is amazing to think legislation that was drafted by the government and that has bipartisan support is yet to come into this chamber for a vote. It's not surprising, however, if you think it is now the responsibility of the member for Deakin. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Deakin was in fact quoted in the media last week as saying that the legislation will be progressed this year, with changes applying 12 months after its passage. That is just not good enough from the member opposite. This legislation needs to come into the House as soon as possible, and the member for Deakin needs to explain why it would need a 12-month application process before it came into effect. People in my community need to be protected from the predatory behaviours of some payday lenders. They need to be protected. They need the protection of this legislation, and this member needs to bring it into this chamber so that we can all vote for it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I have spoken before about Sideffect and the work that Rod and David from Sideffect do in educating and warning about the effects of illicit drugs, especially to parents and children in Western Australia. Sideffect started after Rod Bridge wanted to ensure that families did not end up in a similar situation to him. I first heard about Sideffect when Rod Bridge and David Hobbs came and met me in my office to chat about their project in December 2016. Rod brought along a video that is now used in their presentations, which talked about his son Preston, who died as a result of illicit drugs. That was a heart-rending experience. I know that the member for Canning has got on board, and he is promoting the work that Sideffect do as well. From that point forward, I was motivated to help where I could and to see whatever this government and other governments could do to help further drug education. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years later, the team at Sideffect are working closely with Rio Tinto and other corporations. They are also in the process of launching the Orange Card program—the first of its kind in Australia. It is an online drug awareness and education platform. The aim of the card is to first and foremost educate people on the dangers of using these drugs and their impact on our workplace and community. Sideffect will continue to do great work in Western Australia and, hopefully, across Australia, in warning parents and children about the dangers of illicit drugs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

While Labor is not opposed to the concept of electronic voting, you have to ask yourself the question: why is this Prime Minister and those opposite who from time to time don't even turn up to work, like Senator Cash today, would want to spend millions of dollars on a system that will save less than eight minutes a day. The hypocrisy of this out-of-touch government never ceases to amaze me. Just last week during an MPI, no members of the executive even bothered to enter the chamber. Now we have the Prime Minister persisting with this vanity project costing millions and millions of dollars, while he is cutting school funding, cutting hospital funding and persisting with attacks on seniors and pensioners. </span>

What is more important than presenting in the people's House, representing our community and voting on legislation? I ask: where is the cost-benefit analysis for electronic voting? I ask: why is the Prime Minister asking seniors to work till they are 70 when it appears that he and his ministers don't even want to turn up to work? Prime Minister: why can you find millions and millions of dollars so your ministers can take it easy, while cutting funding for schools, hospitals and pensioners? </span>

It says: 'Teachers, nurses, mechanics to pay more under the Shorten plan.' It goes on: 'Average wage earners such as teachers, nurses and mechanics would be paying between $500 and $2,000 more in personal income tax by 2024-25 under Bill Shorten's tax plan than the coalition's.' The evidence is clear: people will pay more under Labor. We can see from the chart here that a school teacher in New South Wales will pay $578 more in tax under Labor. A rigger will pay $1,152 more in tax. A senior police sergeant will pay $2,124 more in tax. The list goes on and on, and on. A miner will pay $4,061 more in tax. A school principal will pay $6,778 more in tax. The evidence is clear: under Labor, you'll pay more in income tax, you'll pay higher electricity bills, you'll pay more to run your car. It is a clear answer. If people want lower taxes, if they want more opportunities for jobs, if they want lower— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Why is the minister refusing to give evidence under oath? Why is it that the minister will say it to a media conference, or even to the parliament, but not under oath?</span>

Just a few weeks ago, I was with the honourable member in his electorate, where we saw firsthand the benefits of a stronger economy, a stronger economy that makes everything we seek to achieve in our economic plan possible. It means businesses have the confidence to invest and create jobs, to create, last calendar year, the most jobs in any calendar year in our nation's history—over 415,000 jobs. And it's why our policies are focused on delivering every incentive and encouragement we can for Australian businesses. More than a million jobs have been created since the coalition was elected in 2013—overwhelmingly private sector jobs—in less than five years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget is the next step in our national economic plan. It's a budget that provides tax relief for hardworking Australians, for families and households—lower taxes, better services. We're able to deliver this while balancing the budget a year ahead of schedule because we've made the responsible decisions and restrained spending, and the government has lived within its means. And that means we're able to deliver lower, fairer and simpler taxes for middle and lower income Australians: 4.4 million will be receiving relief of $530 next year, and around 10 million Australians will be benefitting in total. Because of the comprehensive nature of our personal income tax plan, it deals with bracket creep. By the time the plan is complete in 2024-25, 94 per cent of Australians will never face a marginal tax rate of more than 32½c. That means that middle-income earners will be vastly better off under our plan than what the Labor Party has attempted to offer up as an alternative. We're talking about teachers and nurses, electricians and mechanics—these are the types of occupations who will be substantially better off under our plan than Labor's alternative, because they will only be paying a top marginal rate of 32½c, which Labor is refusing to support now, having voted for it in the House. They now say they'll oppose it in the Senate. And yet it is Middle Australia that will benefit from this, to the tune of thousands of dollars, in many cases. These are the people the Labor Party used to claim to defend but have now abandoned. Our tax plan offers fairer, simpler, more equitable taxes, and, above all, it gives people more of the money they have earned. It's their money, not the government's, and they're entitled to keep as much of it as they can. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I said in my previous ruling, the question is on the topic of the case, and the Prime Minister's answer is in response to the question. I just need to point out to members on both sides: I'm listening very carefully, given the subject matter, and I'm looking for a range of matters that might breach the practice, including sub judice, reflection on members and all the rest. I've heard the Manager of Opposition Business, but I think it's too much to ask to essentially try and censor the Prime Minister's answer when the question is on the topic of the case. He's sticking to the topic of the case, and I believe he's being relevant to the question that was asked. Has the Prime Minister completed his answer? He has.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:10</span>):  I thank the member for Bennelong for his question. He knows that the budget this year was once again our plan for a stronger economy—a stronger economy that is happening under this coalition government and that has seen more than a million jobs created since we first came to office back in 2013. The budget this year contains a responsible plan to provide tax relief to working Australians. The focus is centred on middle-income-earning Australians. It also continues the responsible plan to ensure that Australians face lower electricity prices under a Turnbull government. The personal tax plan that we've outlined provides $140 billion worth of tax relief to working Australians. That's $140 billion over the next decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Labor Party did when they came into this place last week was strip away $70 billion worth of tax relief for working Australians. They voted to strip out step 2 of the plan, which deals with bracket creep. They voted to strip out step 3 of the plan, which deals with making a simpler tax system, where the Prime Minister rightly said that 94 per cent of Australians would no longer face above a 32½ per cent tax rate. Thirty-two and a half cents would be the highest marginal tax rate they would ever face. By opposing step 2 it means that someone today who is earning less than $80,000—just a bit over $76,000—would face a higher tax rate under the Labor Party than they would under this government. This government wants to deal with bracket creep. The opposition, the Labor Party, want to keep bracket creep for themselves and spend it on whatever pops into their heads. If step 3 of that plan is not supported, then it means that mining apprentices, teachers, forklift drivers, excavators, police sergeants, crane operators, riggers and TAFE workers—all of them—will face a higher rate of tax under the Labor Party than they would under the plan that we have brought into this place. They have a simple way—they only have to do one thing—to ensure that all of those occupations don't face a higher rate of tax, and that is vote for the personal tax plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not only higher taxes that Australians will pay more for under a Labor government. Australians will also pay more for electricity. As a result of the Labor Party's reckless ideological targets, they will face higher electricity prices. On this side of the House, under the Turnbull government, we have a responsible, measured and credible plan, supported by the national Energy Security Board, which will see lower electricity prices in this country. You cannot trust the Labor Party at the end of the day, because you will pay more under Labor because their tax policies are driven by envy and their energy policies are driven by ideology.</span>

                  </a>  Sorry, the court has, at the request of the AWU, of course, thank you. On the application of the union, the court issued the subpoena. This is the third subpoena. One was substantially set aside; the other was completely set aside. Senator Cash is entitled to seek to set aside a subpoena if it's judged not relevant. That is a legal matter for the court. Again, the rule of law must prevail. The central issue, the reason there are court proceedings at all, is that the Registered Organisations Commission is seeking to determine whether the Leader of the Opposition paid $100,000 of his members' money to GetUp! without authority. I think all honourable members would agree that, if the Leader of the Opposition paid $100,000 of his members' money to GetUp! without authority, that would be a very serious wrong, a very serious act of misconduct, misappropriating other people's money. The union has taken action to stop the Registered Organisations Commission from investigating this, and the question is why. It would be very easy to prove. There are plenty of lawyers on that side; all they would need is the minutes of the meeting duly attested and proved, and that would demonstrate that the payment was made with authority. Why hasn't it been produced? No wonder people increasingly believe they cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition with other people's money, let alone with the management of our economy.</span>

Prime Minister, Tasmanians are anxious right now about the GST and whether or not the formula will be changed to our disadvantage. This is a separate matter from your Braddon by-election promise that Tasmania will not see its dollar amount of GST reduced. When will the government respond to the final report of the Productivity Commission inquiry into the GST and, in particular, make clear the government's intention regarding the formula? Most importantly, Prime Minister, will you now commit to not change the GST formula to Tasmania's disadvantage?</span>

The government has been given the Productivity Commission's final report on horizontal fiscal equalisation, which examined our system for determining how GST revenue is distributed among states and territories. This will be released within weeks, not months, but we have to go through and read it carefully. The government has committed to release the report in June. As the Treasurer has committed, both cabinet and the state and territory treasurers will have the opportunity to be briefed on the report before it's published. There will still be an exhaustive process that follows the Productivity Commission report's release. We'll consider its recommendations and work with the states and territories to come up with a package of reforms. It's important we take the time to fully examine any proposed changes to our system of horizontal fiscal equalisation and understand state and territory views and perspectives. It's also important that any new arrangements be seen as fair everywhere. They have to pass the pub test in Burnie, as they do in Bunbury, Ballarat or Bendigo, right around the country. I say to the honourable member: whatever changes are made to the GST to make it fairer or more transparent, payments to Tasmania will not be reduced a cent. Tasmania will not lose a cent. We will ensure that.</span>

She recognises the significance of the superannuation system to the wellbeing of millions of Australians and she knows that that importance cannot be overstated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, of course, a mandatory system, a system where it is incumbent upon every single person to make a contribution to their retirement savings. And we as a government are taking action to ensure that superannuation works for members. As announced in the budget, the government is going to protect the superannuation of millions of Australians by capping administration and investment fees, by banning exit fees, by improving the insurance arrangements that apply and by proactively reuniting people with their own money through the Australian Taxation Office. Those opposite may wish to note that the government is providing more power to the Australian Taxation Office to detect and to punish those employers who don't pay their superannuation entitlements. In fact, we are going to put them in jail, including 12 months in jail for the most egregious cases.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This, of course, is something that the Labor Party never did when they were in office. They talk a big game, but they are very poor when it comes to follow-through. The government also has legislation in the Senate which would remove restrictions on Australians being able to choose their own superannuation fund. At the moment, there are around a million Australians who have no choice in terms of the fund that they put their money into. And this is particularly egregious for those people who have previous employment and a previous fund; they might be paying multiple sets of fees and multiple sets of insurance premiums.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also introduced legislation to improve the powers of the regulator to make sure that we have greater transparency over how funds use members' money. And we want to make sure that those funds are accountable to members whose retirement savings they are looking after. We of course recognise that this is a $2.7 trillion sector and we must protect members' interests.</span>

                  </a>  The question that the Registered Organisations Commission is investigating, as is its duty, is whether members' money was paid to GetUp! without authority. That's the question. That's what it is seeking to investigate. You would think that, the moment the ROC inquired, the union would have said: 'Of course, it was fully authorised. Here are the minutes. Here's all the evidence.' But, no, the union has done everything it can to obstruct the investigation, and the opposition is doing everything it can to support the AWU in obstructing that investigation.</span>

Let's see the evidence. Why won't the Leader of the Opposition and the union produce the evidence? Why are they surprised that people are starting to believe that it was not paid with authority; it was paid in an unauthorised way? Why do they imagine that people wouldn't think that, given the opportunity to provide the evidence has been given but it has not been provided?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ball is very much in the court of the AWU and the Leader of the Opposition. Where is the evidence that this money was paid to GetUp! with authority? It's pretty basic. Looking after members' interests, looking after members' money, putting members first, doing the right thing by the workers—these are all the things that the Leader of the Opposition has claimed he did. We know about the penalty rates he traded away again and again. But this is cold hard cash—$100,000. Was it given to GetUp! with authority or not?</span>

We should be hearing questions about jobs and innovation rather than the muckraking and tearing down that we're hearing from those opposite. I'm glad to get a question from our side about jobs, innovation and infrastructure. I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. He is a tireless fighter for his local community, for Victoria and for the infrastructure and the jobs that our nation needs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is delivering. A million jobs have been created throughout Australia, including in Victoria and Tasmania, thanks to this government's strong economic plan—a plan which has taken the pressure off small and medium businesses through tax cuts and the instant asset write-off, which was extended for another 12 months in the Treasurer's excellent budget; a plan which will see Australians keeping more of their hard-earned money in their pockets through our personal income tax cuts; and a plan that is delivering the vital infrastructure needed to boost the economy, connect local communities and create local jobs. It's all about productivity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member's electorate is benefiting from a $500 million investment in the Monash Freeway, connecting his region with Melbourne and other parts of regional Victoria. The constituents of La Trobe will be amongst those in the region to benefit from our commitment to the Melbourne Airport rail link—$5 billion—which will deliver the much-needed, long-called-for rail link between Tullamarine and the CBD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member asked me more broadly about infrastructure connecting local communities, and I'm delighted to inform him of the government's infrastructure investment in Tasmania. Warwick Smith, the former member for Bass, will also be delighted to hear this. In the north-west, and in the west of Tasmania, in the seat of Braddon, this government has delivered with Gawler River, Stony Point Creek and Zeehan Rivulet bridge replacements. There is $3½ million for eight community infrastructure projects under the Regional Jobs and Investment program, a wonderful initiative, including: the Wild Mersey Mountain Bike Trails project, the Burnie Waterfront Eastern Promenade, and a project unlocking export opportunities for seed potato production in the Apple Isle. There is $11.1 million for a number of projects under the Community Development Grants Program, including the Devonport Gymnastics Club project and a new community facility on King Island, building community capacity and creating local jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about the risks. There are those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition stands opposed to jobs creation, he stands opposed to higher wages for Tasmanians and he stands opposed to business growth. I can't understand why he's so anti business and so anti start-ups, particularly in Tasmania. The Leader of the Opposition is a clear and present danger to the continued growth, prosperity, job creation and hard earned wages of all Tasmanians. </span>

I heard about it this morning. The fact is this is the third time a subpoena has been issued. I'll just refer the honourable member to the court order setting aside one of the previous subpoenas. The court said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst the Minister may have an interest in the outcome of this proceeding, she is not a party to it and ought not be burdened with making substantial enquiries in the search for documents unless and until it is apparent that the documents sought may be of assistance to the AWU’s case.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has said her lawyers will apply to set aside this subpoena, as they have the previous ones, and the court will make a decision. But the honourable member should recognise that the issue in the proceedings does not relate to Senator Cash. The issue here is about an attempt to stop the Registered Organisations Commission from finding out whether $100,000 of AWU members' money was lawfully paid or not. That is a legitimate inquiry. Do honourable members opposite seriously believe—does the member for Batman, a distinguished trade unionist herself, seriously believe—that the payment of union members' money to an activist group should be done with authority, or not? That is the question. She may think that paying tax is a privilege, but I don't think that union members believe that paying their dues is a privilege. They believe it's paid to the union to represent them, right? And handing it out to GetUp! without authority? Surely that should affront the honour and decency of every trade unionist opposite, but they all seem to be determined to do everything they can to stop the Registered Organisations Commission finding out whether $100,000 of AWU members' hard-earned cash was paid to GetUp! without authority. Surely the truth should out, and the Leader of the Opposition and the union should explain whether it was paid with authority or not and stop trying to obstruct this investigation. </span>

And we will deal with that. I want to thank the member for Brisbane, and in particular I note that he had a tremendous career before coming to this place, including being the CEO of the National Retail Association. One of the things he learnt in that role is that, whether you want to grow a small business or an economy, you need a plan. He learnt that in order to do that, the plan starts with competitiveness; the ability to deliver better service more efficiently and more effectively. In order to do that as an economy, you have to be able to deliver more jobs, and we are delivering a million extra jobs.</span>

                  </a>  Those million extra jobs are what allow us to guarantee essential services. Those essential services include: record funding for Medicare, with an additional $4.8 billion; record funding for age care, with an additional $5 billion; record funding for mental health, with an additional $338 million; and record funding for hospitals, with an additional $30 billion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In mentioning hospitals, I should note that only a week and a half ago I accompanied the member for Brisbane to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital. It's a great hospital, and we made a major announcement in ensuring there is better resistance to antimicrobial challenges, so making real progress. But I've seen something interesting about hospital funding recently. The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital is in the Metro North Hospital and Health Service area of Queensland. I saw a statement from a former member of this House, Susan Lamb, who said, 'Don't cut money from Caboolture Hospital', which is also in the metro north area. I thought to myself: 'Did we cap funds? No, we added $120 million in the last budget.' Did Labor in Queensland cut funds? Yes, they did; they cut $21 million from the Caboolture Hospital region, which is the metro north region.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can also compare what we've done in relation to new medicines and what the ALP did. On the weekend we listed Cabometyx, a new medicine for renal cancer. This can help save people's lives and protect lives. I met Gil, who said that he believed with this medicine he would have the chance of walking his daughter down the aisle early next year. That is about saving lives. But let me say this: that has not always been the approach of the other side. They deliberately delayed seven new medicines, including for in-vitro fertilisation and endometriosis. And why? Because in the end— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We have made decisions, which have resulted in securing our borders. So it is quite amazing that many members opposite are running around at the moment trying to work out ways in which they could dismantle the policy of this government which has stopped the drownings at sea, has stopped the children going into detention and has stopped new boat arrivals.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note that, on the weekend, there was a conference in Victorian with the ALP putting forward a motion to try to stop Operation Sovereign Borders and unwind the policies that we had presided over. You would have thought that there would be a debate and that those on the left would have been allowed to put their opinions as to why they wanted to trash the successful policy of stopping the boats, but the difficulty is that the Leader of the Opposition didn't want that debate to take place. So what did he do? He called on his old mates from the CFMMEU. Normally the CFMMEU close down building sites, but instead they closed down this debate. So you can imagine that, in the theatre where this debate is about to take place, the next thing is that people hear the hum of motorcycles downstairs, they hear the clanging of the chains and they hear the knocking of the knuckledusters as people are marching up to the auditorium. The CFMMEU burst through the doors and they close the debate down, because they provide their numbers once again to the Leader of the Opposition. What did he have to do to get that deal? What did he have to promise the CFMMEU? We will never know unless he is elected as the next Prime Minister. This Leader of the Opposition has more shady figures in his background and in his present than any former Leader of the Labor Party. The fact is that nobody can trust a word that this man utters. He has been involved in ripping off workers. It's documented well and truly.</span>

In 2013, the coalition promised to provide 50 per cent growth funding for hospital services. The government broke that promise, cut its contribution and is now paying only 45 per cent, meaning it is cutting $2.8 billion from hospitals from 2019 to 2025. Why is this Prime Minister giving an $80 billion handout to big business instead of properly funding our hospitals across Australia? Here is your policy, in case you haven't seen it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  Let me start with a single figure: $30 billion. Thirty billion dollars is the amount that we are adding to hospital expenditure in Australia, and we go this year from $21 billion to $22 billion to $23 billion and to $24 billion. What we see is that, from when Labor was last in office, we go from $13 billion to more than double that, $28 billion, by the end of the next hospital funding agreement. There is a 116 per cent increase in hospital funding on our watch. That's the reality. But you might want to compare and contrast this with what is happening with Labor in Longman. We have mentioned today that we increased funding for Metro North not by $10, $20, $30 or $40 million but by $120 million in the last financial year alone, but how much did Queensland Labor decrease funding by? Not $5, not $10, not $15, not $20 but $21 million; that is what they cut from their own hospitals, whilst we increased it by $120 million. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fascinating that Labor raise this figure, because what we see now is that Labor are walking away from even their own policy on hospital funding. What we have now is Labor running around the country making little contributions here or there, but there's a simple question: will they guarantee that every single dollar they have will be allocated under activity based funding? The answer is: they've walked away from their own policy. At the last election, some in this House may remember Labor were talking about a figure of $57 billion. Do you know what? They turned up to the election with a $2 billion figure and a $55 billion black hole against their own funding. They never funded their own complaints. They never funded the very thing that they implied for many years that they would do. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when it comes down to it, you see what we're doing: $30 billion of additional funding for hospitals in Australia—record funding each year, every year, in every state and territory. And, when it comes to Longman and Caboolture, we see that Metro North had a $21 million cut under Queensland Labor, but there is absolute silence from this opposition.</span>

It was just last year that a committee of this House made a bipartisan finding with respect to the Family Court system that there was overwhelming evidence received highlighting the complexity of navigating multiple jurisdictions and multiple courts within the same jurisdiction. The same committee again considered, on a bipartisan basis, that 'the system of the two federal courts with concurrent jurisdiction should be simplified'. In fact, the overwhelming evidence for the need to reform the present system has been known for well over a decade. In 2008 a review commissioned by the then Labor government saw the Semple report say to the then Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, now Justice McClelland, that 'having two independent courts handling largely the same work has created confusion for litigants' and that having the concurrent jurisdictions has 'created a number of difficulties'. What I wanted to give the House was one example of those sorts of difficulties. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year there were 20,500 matters listed for final order applications in the two existing courts. Last year there were 1,200 matters, so that represents thousands of individual Australians who were moved from one court to the other. For example, if a matter was moved from the Federal Circuit Court to the Family Court, the family waited, on average, 11 months for that move to take place. After 11 months, they are literally required to start again in a different court with different rules, different forms, different procedures and different practice directions. In one case, a couple who started in the Federal Circuit Court in July 2015 were transferred to the Family Court nearly two years after filing and then two months later were sent back to the Federal Circuit Court. Now, can you imagine the difficulties, the unnecessary cost and the burden for that family, not to mention the turmoil and frustration caused that family in what is most likely one of the most miserable periods, as it was, of their life? Fixing that problem of transferals between courts will allow us to have hundreds more family law matters dealt with every year inside existing resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To address that very serious problem, the Turnbull government has announced today the establishment of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. It is one single family law jurisdiction, one single point of entry and a single, more stringent set of initial assessment so that we can triage cases according to a sophisticated measure of their complexity. There is the allocation of $4 million to allow the new court to be enabled to lead a process of drafting all of the new court's rules, processes, practice directions and proceedings from scratch. That is so that we will have a single court with a single point of entry and vastly improved process for the tens of thousands of Australian families who at the moment are not being served well by existing arrangements.</span>

Why is the prime Minister choosing to gift $17 billion to the big banks instead of supporting Labor's commitment to invest $10 million for chemotherapy treatment at Caboolture Hospital so that people living on Bribie Island can get the cancer treatment they need far closer to home, rather than being required to travel far greater distances into Brisbane itself?</span>

                  </a>  The government supports Australia having a competitive company tax rate for the same reason the member for McMahon said in his much remaindered book on the subject. He said it was necessary to keep Australian businesses competitive. That is because if Australian businesses are competitive, then they can create jobs, as they have done. There were 415,000 jobs created last year and over a million jobs created since the coalition came into government at the end of 2013.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of Caboolture Hospital, let's not forget this: as the Minister for Health and Sport has set out already, the federal government is providing record growth in funding to Metro North hospitals in Brisbane, which includes Caboolture Hospital. In fact, the state Labor government's funding has been going backwards. That's the big difference. More dollars from the federal government are going into Caboolture Hospital at record levels. Labor's truck, which is going around the Longman electorate, says that the federal government is cutting funding to Caboolture Hospital—that is a lie. It doesn't matter how many times that lying truck goes around the block; it will not make that lie a truth.</span>

The last part of his question was: when was the last time a government invested in military capability build-up of this scale? The answer to that is: in the Second World War. World War II was the last time that a government invested on the scale that we are investing today. This is the biggest build-up of our military capability in 70 years: $200 billion over the next 10 years, giving the safety that we need as a nation, protecting our national interest, and using that enormous heft to drive small and medium enterprises, and large primes in defence industry, creating innovation, sophisticated jobs and advanced manufacturing. I am asked by the member for Canning to update the House on the naval shipbuilding plan. I wouldn't use a prop, but I might table a document later in answer to this question. Only last weekend at 3 am in the member for Canning's electorate, Austal launched the first of the Pacific patrol boats, the Guardian class—</span>

                  </a>   I will show you in a minute—a $335 million program driving jobs and growth, 21 of them to be provided to 12 different South Pacific nations, supporting our allies across the South Pacific as a country the size of Australia should, with 400 jobs in the Henderson Maritime Precinct. That is the beginning of a 54 vessel program across many decades, created by this government. The last ship that would ever have been built under the Labor Party, if Labor had been re-elected in 2013, was the one that we launched at Osborne two weeks ago, the last of the air warfare destroyers. The only ship they ever commissioned was the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Choules</span>, which they bought from Britain. They didn't invest one dollar in any vessel built in an Australian shipyard; we have 54. That Pacific patrol boat program, the Guardian class, isn't just creating jobs in Canning; it's also going to be creating jobs in the member for Leichhardt's electorate. That is where the deep maintenance will be done. That is worth $400 million over the life of the program, and $380 million of new infrastructure, in Cairns. We have a national project from Henderson to Cairns launched on Sunday at 3 am, driving jobs and growth. It would have only happened under this government. It is the beginning of a $90 billion naval shipbuilding program, and I table this very handsome photograph of the Pacific patrol boats. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I note that we have record funding from the federal government to the Metro North Hospital network, which includes a 53 per cent increase to local hospitals compared to the level of funding under Labor. That includes Caboolture Hospital. The claim that Labor is making in the Longman electorate that the government is cutting funding to Caboolture Hospital is an outrageous lie. That goes further than simply recording the fact that what Labor is saying is untrue and setting the record straight; it tells us a lot about the character of the Labor Party—</span>

Compare that to Labor's last year in power, when 15,600 small and family businesses closed and 14,000 jobs in construction were lost. That's why we need the ABCC, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and that's why we've empowered it to keep the rule of law on our building sites.</span>

Fifty-nine convictions! They range across the following: assaulting police, five times; assault by kicking—classy!—five times; wilful trespass, seven times; resisting arrest, five times; theft, once; attempted theft by deception, once; intent to coerce, nine times; coercion, 10 times; adverse action, once. And he's been jailed twice for contempt of court. When the member for Hunter said 'civil disobedience', I thought, 'Mandela; Martin Luther King—John Setka? No! I don't think so!'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, for all Mr Setka's shortcomings, of which there are many, when he was interviewed by Neil Mitchell on 18 May and Mitchell asked, 'Well, John, do you trust Bill Shorten?' John Setka's response was, 'Well, if he becomes Prime Minister, ask me six months later. I mean, I don't know.' Not even John Setka trusts the Leader of the Opposition. It is not just the people of Australia who have worked out the Leader of the Opposition; it is his union mates, who, having done secret deals with him, after all that is said and done still do not trust the Leader of the Opposition. And they are wise not to. We must make sure he remains the Leader of the Opposition, never Prime Minister of this country.</span>

And we are able to provide that funding because we have the budget under control, because we're able to bring it back into balance. We're able to put life-saving drugs on the PBS, not like Labor, who had to hold them back because they couldn't afford to put drugs onto the PBS. You know very well you did. You held them back.

Importantly, in the electorate of Barker, as in the rest of the country, low- and middle-income families will be the greatest beneficiaries from this package. Our $2½ billion investment in the system is going to target support to families earning the least and to families working the most.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these changes include scrapping the annual rebate for most families, increasing the hourly cap and reducing the 15 per cent withholding rate introduced by Labor in 2011 to five per cent. In fact, under our reforms one million Australian families will benefit from these changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see the shadow minister is interjecting. I like the shadow minister very much, but I did see an interview that she gave just before question time, and she is not very good at maths. She really is not very good at maths, because a million families are going to be better off under these changes and nearly 7½ thousand families in her own electorate will be better off under these changes. This is targeted towards low- and middle-income families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked by the member for Barker about differing approaches, and that is a good example. We're making changes to drive down the cost of child care. When the Labor Party was last in government, they made changes that the Productivity Commission highlighted made the cost of child care actually go up. They withheld 15 per cent of families' child care benefits and the child care rebate, but our reforms will mean that Australian families will be able to keep more of their money. Our child care and early learning reforms will ensure that Australian families get every cent they are entitled to and that they can have access to these very important services at reduced out-of-pocket expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many families will be hundreds if not thousands of dollars better off. I'm happy to give the House a couple of real-life examples A family on $50,000 with both parents working and with two children aged under six in long day care for two days a week at $100 a day will be $2,000 better off. A family on $80,000 with both parents working and two kids under six in long day care for three days a week at $100 a day will be $3,000 better off. These are real-life examples about how these reforms are going to improve the lives of Australian families, putting downward pressure on the cost of living, as opposed to Labor's record when they were in office.</span>

Why won't this Prime Minister support lower taxes for 10 million Australians, including teachers, nurses, electricians and mechanics, instead of giving an $80 billion tax cut to big business?</span>

Not even Bob Carr is that stupid! I'm sure he's nobody's puppet. I will quote the Leader of the Opposition. You may think this quote was from some time ago, maybe back when he was advocating a three-level tax rate in Australia, as was the Henry review, but this was only in September of last year. In Townsville, the leader of the Labor Party said:</span>

That's what our plan is doing. If you're sitting down there in Braddon, Longman or Mayo or anywhere else, know this: under Labor you will pay more. You will pay more in tax, you will pay more in electricity bills, you will be paying more on your private health insurance, and under the coalition you will be paying less.</span>

Of course, she delivered nothing like the previous LNP member for Longman. Look at what he delivered in terms of mobile base stations, for example: seven base stations in Longman. And, of course, in Fairfax, there were three base stations under the Mobile Black Spot Program.</span>

How much additional coverage did Labor deliver? Zero! How many new towers did Labor deliver? Zero. Triple-zero is a well-known number in telecommunications; it took Labor to turn it into a policy! They're delivering nothing! They're delivering nothing for their constituents. We're delivering; Team LNP is delivering.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  This is a very important matter, because, of course, wherever you look with respect to this government, it fails to give account to the Australian people. Whether it be providing $80 billion to the big end of town or whether it's, indeed, failing to account for a number of areas of public policy, we see ministers in this government failing to be transparent and failing to account for their actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that's been underlined most dramatically today when we've seen again Minister Cash failing to come clean about her level of involvement—the extent and nature of her involvement—in relation to the unlawful leak to the media about the police raids on AWU offices seven months ago. For the last seven months, we've seen obfuscation and cover-up by this government. In fact, in October last year the minister, Senator Cash, in answers to questions in the Senate on five separate occasions, misled the parliament when she said that her office was not involved in unlawfully providing information to media about police raids. The fact is that since that time we have not seen any effort by the minister to account for herself, and today in a press conference she's made very clear that she will ensure she'll spend taxpayer's dollars avoiding the courts as well. This is a minister who refuses to account to the parliament and doesn't want to account to the courts. She wants to avoid accountability and does not want to tell the truth when it comes to this very serious matter, and the fact is we can't allow this to continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is actually consistent with the conduct of this minister for many, many months. Firstly, we saw the minister appoint a commissioner to the ABCC who had, indeed, deliberately provided unlawful advice and placed that on the website. We saw the same minister appoint 11 consecutive employer based commissioners to the Fair Work Commission, which added to the three appointments by Senator Abetz when he was minister. That's 14 consecutive commissioners now that come from one side of the bargaining table. We've seen, of course, the efforts by the minister to avoid accountability in relation to these matters. But this matter here is of most importance, because for seven months we have had a failure to account for her conduct and the conduct of her office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know, of course, that the staffer who made admissions to the minister about leaking that information has left the office of the minister. We also know that there are now four staff members of that office that have left, yet we have not actually been provided with any information as to why they have departed the minister's office. Today, of course, we've seen the court subpoena not only the minister but, indeed, the head of the Registered Organisations Commission, the former employee of the minister's office and a former employee of the Registered Organisations Commission. These matters should be answered. If the minister thinks it's okay to spend taxpayers' money to seek to set aside the subpoena so she won't account to the court, the question has to be asked: what does she have to hide? What does she have to hide to avoid these court proceedings, and why is it that, when she's been asked questions in Senate estimates and in the Senate, she has sought to claim a defence of public interest immunity to avoid answering any questions of the Senate?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The highest obligation of a minister of the Crown is to account for and be responsible for their conduct. The fact is that, under the Westminster system, ministers are responsible for the conduct of their office. So already it's clear, given the conduct of the office of Minister Cash, that she should have already resigned. She should have resigned seven months ago. Since then she has failed to answer any questions in relation to further conduct by that office, and the conduct of herself, and for that reason she should be censured by the parliament and she should resign or, indeed, if she fails to resign, the Prime Minister should sack her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister in the last seven months has defended the minister when she has refused to answer any questions in relation to this matter. This is a sordid saga. This is a seven-month scandal that will not go away. There will be court proceedings that will, of course, be heard in several months. Meanwhile, we have a minister who refuses to do her job. We have a minister who refuses to attend Senate estimates late yesterday and, indeed, all of today. She's in the building, she's in the parliament and she's there to do her day job, but she doesn't turn up to do that. The fact is you cannot continue to have a minister who represents the junior minister at the table in the Senate not turn up to act on his behalf. She's scheduled to turn up. She's actually in attendance in the parliament but refuses point blank to turn up to the Senate budget estimates and answer questions. Well, frankly, this is an untenable position for Minister Cash and this is an untenable position for the Prime Minister too. He cannot keep defending the indefensible in relation to this matter. There is no defence to suggest that the minister is not answerable to the parliament. The fact is she continues, of course, to argue otherwise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just in relation to Minister Cash that we see this lack of accountability; it also applies to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has failed the Australian people. The Prime Minister seeks to introduce his central tax plan to provide $80 billion of taxpayers' money to the big end of town. Frankly, this is very unfair on working people. This is very, very unfair on the millions of working people who require some support. It's unfair that we would seek to provide $80 billion of taxpayers' money to the big end of town and, at the same time, deprive workers of a decent wage increase. We've seen wages stagnating in this country. On 1 July this year there's a second round of penalty rate cuts for retail and hospitality workers. There's a bill that could be introduced into this parliament today by the minister at the table that would have the effect of stopping the penalty rates decision in its tracks and stopping further cuts, and yet, of course, we see the minister at the table, the Prime Minister and Minister Cash refuse to accept the argument that those workers should not have their wages cut in real terms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This disregard for working people is quite remarkable from a Prime Minister who likes to argue that he cares about the Australian workforce. Frankly, if you look at the record of the Australian Prime Minister, he has no regard for the Australian workforce. He has no regard for hardworking people—middle-class and working-class Australians—who are struggling to make ends meet. All they wish to have is a decent pay raise. Of course we are not surprised that the Prime Minister doesn't have any empathy for these workers because, frankly, he doesn't understand. He does not understand the concerns, the needs and the aspirations of these workers. The Prime Minister likes to pretend he has regard for them, but he feels comfortable in the boardroom and he feels uncomfortable in workplaces. This is a Prime Minister who has invented a log cabin story. This is a Prime Minister who pretends he has a log cabin story, except, of course, the logs were made of bars of gold. The fact is this Prime Minister has never financially struggled in his life, and he has never had any regard for working people in his country. He never regards them when he introduces his policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most remarkable thing is that we know that trickle-down economics don't work, but it works for the very few, including the Prime Minister. The richest man in the parliament, the biggest shareholder in the parliament, will be the biggest beneficiary of the trickle-down economics that are being introduced by this parliament. The budget is, of course, the values and the priorities of the Prime Minister writ large. He is a person who has no interest in working people. He is a former merchant banker who spends more time talking to bankers than he does talking to workers. It's this lack of accountability and this lack of regard for working people that we see every day in this place from this Prime Minister. That's the reality, whether it's Minister Cash, who refuses to appear in the parliament and is spending taxpayers' money refusing to go to court, or a Prime Minister who has no interest and lives in his social citadel at Point Piper instead of looking after decent working people in this country and giving those workers a pay rise.</span>

It's just more of the same. Where is one policy that those opposite have that will create one job? Where it is? It's non-existent.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make a couple of points with respect to the shadow minister's comments regarding, firstly, appointments on the Fair Work Commission. I noted with interest last week that apparently, according to him, we've stacked the joint. I would draw to his attention that currently, among those sitting on the Fair Work Commission, it is 51 per cent put there by Labor versus 49 per cent from us. We are, of course, the 49 per cent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also say that, as the Prime Minister said in question time, there's a very simple way for the ROC, the Registered Organisations Commission: the action would never have been taken if the union had provided the documentation on the authorisation for the $100,000 of—and here's the key—union members' money. It's not the union delegates' money, it's not union bosses' money, it's not the Labor Party's money and it's definitely not the Leader of the Opposition's money; it is union members' money. Why is it that those opposite fight so hard against transparency—and here's the other misnomer—of not just unions but any registered organisation, yet, at the same time, at the back end of the banking royal commission—you watch them—they'll be calling for company directors to be hanged, drawn and quartered? That behaviour, if found to be true, should absolutely be penalised, and I note that the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services has already made indications that there'll be a considerable stiffening of penalties on the corporate side of the fence, as there should be. But there should be responsibility on anyone that looks after anyone else's money. There should be transparency for anyone that looks after anyone—</span>

                  </a>  In the last year of the Labor government, in 2012-13, 15,500 small and family businesses in construction closed, with a net decrease of 14,000 jobs. In the past 4½ years in construction, with the rule of law restored, there has been a net increase of 35,600 businesses, amounting to an increase in employment in the sector of 200,000 people, driven predominantly by small and family businesses taking on bank debt, backing themselves and employing people. Across the board, there have been 150,000 additional small businesses opened over the past 4½ years. Compare that to the last 12 months of the Rudd-Gillard government, when there was a net decrease in businesses in this country of 61,000, irrespective of the business's size. But in the past 12 months, just in small and family businesses—businesses with turnover of $10 million or less—65,000 have opened. In other words, in the last 12 months under the Turnbull coalition government, more small and family businesses have opened than the net decrease in businesses, irrespective of size, under the previous Rudd-Gillard government. As they say, if you want more of the same, re-elect them. You'll see it again. They will roll over and pay back their secret deals with their secret union mates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke about reducing red tape yesterday in question time. It has been reduced by $6 billion for businesses in the last 4½ years, and there has been an $800 million reduction in red tape in the last financial year. There is the instant asset write-off of $20,000. Free trade agreements have been used in my electorate, especially by young Australian entrepreneurs of Chinese descent, leveraging their family networks to distribute back in mainland China. There is the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. There are new forms of financing including crowdfunding. In the start-up sector, there are tax concessions to angel investors and early-stage venture capital investors. What has happened? We've seen an increase of over100 per cent in venture capital funds—not our work. It was AVCO, independent of government, availing us of that in the last few months. What we would see under those opposite would threaten all of that. </span>

Again, do you want to see hypocrisy? In 2010, the Fair Work Commission made a decision to reduce penalty rates in some awards. In 2010, the Labor Party were in control. There was not one word from any member opposite. Why? Because the Fair Work Commission was completely of their design. It was staffed with their people. It came up with the decision. There was not one word. That changed, however, in 2014, when they went into opposition. Again, in 2014, the Fair Work Commission reduced penalty rates for some awards. I quote directly the member for Gorton when he was asked about these penalty rate cuts: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony of where I find myself as the minister for industrial relations is that I am actually arguing for the integrity of the system—the Fair Work Act and the Fair Work Commission—that the Labor Party set up. What else did we get under the last Labor government? We got jobless queues growing by 206,000 in their six-year tenure. What have we had? We have had one million new jobs created in the economy over the past 4½ years. In the last 12 months, 417,000—80 per cent cent—of those jobs were full-time. It's a record. We are into our 18th month of positive employment growth—yet another record. We're into our 27th year of continued economic growth, while those opposite want to continually try to obfuscate their union mates, whom, at the end of the day, they are here to represent. I don't mind that, because my family come from a union background. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are good union members in this country. There are good union delegates in this country. There are good unions in this country. The ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission are there to hold to account those who fail that test. They are there to make sure that the rule of law on construction sites is adhered to. They are there to make sure that members' money is used appropriately. Is that fair? Yes, it is fair. It's absolutely fair. It's what every union member in this country should expect and, more importantly, be entitled to. If those opposite aren't going to insist on that happening, we are going to keep hearing cases of where it doesn't happen. Instead of coming in here and bagging the officials that hold rogue union delegates to account, they should come in here and condemn their abhorrent criminal behaviour. Do you hear 'boo'? No, you don't. You see secret deals being done by the Leader of the Opposition with a guy like John Setka, who has a rap sheet as long as your arm. As I said today in question time, no Australian would be proud of one iota of the 59 offences and nor would he be someone that they would want to associate with. However, that's not the case for the Leader of the Opposition. He is not only associating with him; he's relying on his votes so that he can maintain his slippery hold on leadership. If this country elects him, we are all up the creek without a paddle. </span>

It's a great responsibility, because you hold great power—the power of the state and its agencies. We also know that parliament is the sentry to this extraordinary power. This is the heart of the Westminster system. The parliament reigns supreme. It is not just a tradition. It is not just a debating point. It exists in the Statement of Ministerial Standards. If you go to page 9 of this statement—and I recommend those opposite have a look at it—it says in clause 4.4: </span>

Instead, we have a minister presiding over this mess, setting out to get the Leader of the Opposition, setting out to get the unions and setting out to embroil the government in this witch-hunt. In the process, the minister is creating this omnishambles, which is now consuming the actions of this government. We know what an omnishambles is. For those opposite, I will give you the definition: it is a situation that has been comprehensively mismanaged, characterised by a string of blunders or miscalculations. What better way to describe a minister who misleads the Senate and misleads the estimates five times, and then has to come back into the Senate and say, 'Oh, actually, a member of my own staff tipped off the media as to a police raid on a union office.'

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The poor minister! It is everyone else's fault! It is the big mean unions, it is the nasty old Labor Party, it is the Department of Parliamentary Services! How cowardly do you have to be to blame the attendants in this building? It's the journalists! It's everyone else!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time for her to rock up to estimates and account for her actions. It is the bare minimum that a minister needs to do. If she can't do it, then the way open for her is just to resign. That's the Westminster tradition. That's what you should do. That's how you protect the government. Those opposite absolutely know that. They know that it's only a matter of time before this minister had to resign. Get it over with, because otherwise we'll deal with it parliamentary week after parliamentary week. It will cost this government more and more until election day, and then they'll be accountable to the Australian people.</span>

He is a passionate contributor, and he did get one thing right: this is about cash. We should talk about this mob over here, where they source their cash and what they do with it. Let's be very, very frank, there is no-one on that side of the room anymore who actually represents the working people in the country. Working people get up every single day, put on their hard hats, put on their high-vis, put on their safety boots and go to work.</span>

                  </a>  I acknowledge the work of the unions over many, many years. They have done things that are valuable. They are, in fact, a necessarily evil.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's look at where that money goes, because it goes into the union and we know that it now goes from the AWU to GetUp!—$100,000. And what does GetUp! do with that money? What do they do with it? They go out and run an anti-coal campaign. They go and run a campaign against the resources industry, to take the jobs away from the people making the contribution to the AWU, to the CFMEU, to what was the ETU, to Labor and to GetUp! to get rid of their jobs! What sort of circle is that? To make these contributions all the way round the circle, from hardworking people to unions, to Labor, to GetUp! to get rid of their industry? I mean, that is just outrageous!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How can they sit over there and say that they represent working people but want to close their industry? The resources industry is incredibly important to Australia: it is a very strong contributor to our GDP, it provides tens of thousands of jobs and we know that there are lobby groups out there like GetUp! that want them to be gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This $100,000, what was it? Was it Christmas? Was it Santa Claus? Did Santa decide that he should push $100,000 from the AWU across to GetUp!—really? Was it their birthday? Well, no, someone made a decision. And that decision was made by the Leader of the Opposition, the former head of the AWU, one Bill Shorten. Now, he should be accountable for those decisions, because that money is trying to get to rid of the jobs of the people who are making the contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do you say to the comrades? Well, comrades, we really want you to continue to contribute. We want you to continue to give us money so we can fight our good fight. But we also want you to be out of a job. We want your industry to be closed down. We do not want you to have a job at all. So we'll continue to go to GetUp! and continue to let them campaign. We'll let them campaign to shut your industry so that you no longer have a position and you can't pay your union fees and dues. I'm not sure what you think happens next, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I would imagine there'd be no more contributions. I would imagine that there would be no more money to be paid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this debate is also about trust. Who do we trust? Do we trust the Leader of the Opposition? This is a man who goes to Melbourne and tells the people of Melbourne that he doesn't support the resources industry. In fact, he doesn't want to see the Galilee Basin opened. He thinks that's terrible because he's trying to win the Batman by-election. But when he goes to Biloela or Moranbah he has a completely different perception, and that is that he supports resources. So we can't trust the Leader of the Opposition on resources; we simply cannot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or what about energy? The contribution from the Labor Party is that they want a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target. This will drive up prices, there is no doubt about that at all. In fact, as an electrical engineer, I struggle to understand the concept where you would make your generation system—half of your capacity—a variable supply, one which doesn't work in the dark and won't work if it's calm. What do we do? Do we turn off half the nation when it doesn't operate?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the challenges that we need to look at. You cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition—you cannot trust him when it comes to resources, you cannot trust him when it comes to energy and you can't trust him on borders. We've heard this debate and we saw the contribution from Mr Dutton, the shareholding minister. What happens when there's a debate on? Well, they shut it down. We've certainly heard from Mr Dutton how that happens. You get your mates from the CFMEU to come down. And where do they get their funding from? From those poor, hardworking people who are out there doing their gig and looking for support from their unions and organisers, who take that money and want to get rid of their jobs. They want them gone. They want to open borders and they want to increase the cost of electricity. This is just an absolutely outrageous list of things that the Leader of the Opposition wants to do, and he cannot be trusted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last word should go to Mr Setka. Mr Setka was very, very clear in his quote when he was asked, 'Do you trust Bill Shorten?' Well, the short answer, in one second, was, 'No, I do not.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  Today's MPI really is about accountability, and today's question time was about bringing to account the behaviour and the actions of the minister. So far today, not one government member has defended the minister. No-one has got up and said, 'She's done a good job.' No-one has said, 'Well, she's achieved all these great things.' No-one is backing in the minister. That's because those on the other side simply do not believe in what the minister has done. If they had, they would be referencing it. The previous minister at the table, Minister Laundy, gave a spirited defence of everything other than Minister Cash. You have to put this into context: this is the same minister who, last Friday, didn't lodge his own nomination form to sit in this parliament. The New South Wales Liberal Party has had to extend and reopen nominations. It's bad enough for the member for Gilmore sitting here, who is now confirmed to be under challenge from a Mr Schultz in her own electorate; we're now seeing ministers fail to complete the most basic of paperwork to sit in this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing is clearer when it comes to accountability than with respect to the Minister for Jobs and Innovation and her desperate attempt to escape any scrutiny over her involvement, and that of her office, in the leak to the media of the Registered Organisations Commission raid on the AWU offices. I will spend some time going through the history of this, which demonstrates very clearly the lack of accountability from the minister in the parliament. For seven months the minister has dodged, weaved and hidden behind whiteboards. I did laugh today when she was asked about the whiteboard incident in one of her rare media performances, and she said with a straight face:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Do you think you were surprised? You should have seen the look on my face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We couldn't, because she was wheeling the whiteboard to hide from people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the facts. In late October last year the minister misled the Senate five times by falsely denying that her office was the source of the leak, but lo and behold, after some time and reflection, a few hours later she walked in and said that her office was the source of the leak to the media and that her staff had informed unlawfully. The AFP quite rightly then launched a criminal investigation into the leak, and despite fessing up and owning that her office was the source of the leak, the minister won't disclose if she has been questioned or interviewed by the AFP—a pretty simple yes or no.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't say this lightly, but I believe this reeks of a cover-up. The minister is running away from any accountability. Now we're reaching a tipping point where the Prime Minister needs to reflect if Minister Cash is still the best person for the job. At this stage it appears she clearly does not want to be in that job. Budget estimates happen once a year, an important function in holding a government to account. It is Minister Cash's job as a minister of the Crown to turn up and answer questions. It is incumbent upon ministers to be there and answer questions truthfully, yet she is not there today and abandoned it yesterday. Instead, despite a unanimous request by the Senate committee for her to return to estimates later this afternoon to face the music, the minister has failed to offer any excuse as to why she believes she is above the standard set for representatives of the people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not good enough. Members opposite should get up and criticise her for not doing her job and not being held accountable. We are accountable in this place. Forget all the rhetoric and nonsense that the government is saying. The minister is on trial today. She is the one responsible. She is the one avoiding scrutiny. Perhaps the minister was not in the building this morning. She may in good conscience have had more important parliamentary work to attend to. But I'm advised that the minister was in the building during Senate estimates today, sitting down instead with the member for Gilmore making Facebook videos. The topic of discussion? Providing flexibility for older Australians when it comes to working. I know the member for Gilmore is under pressure because she is being challenged, despite the Prime Minister offering her support— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:54</span>):  It is indeed a pleasure to stand and speak in response to the speakers that have gone beforehand on this matter of public interest—that is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The failure of the Government to be accountable to the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This MPI is not a witch-hunt for Senator Cash; it is about accountability. The government speakers have articulately spoken about issues of accountability. I want to take the point from the member of Oxley, who said no-one here had stood to offer any type of spirited defence of Senator Cash, the Minister for Jobs and Innovation. I will absolutely do that. I owe a great deal of thanks to Senator Cash. Within my electorate, I have no less than 11,000 road transport operators. Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, you would remember not too long ago how the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, if it had come into effect, would have forced no less than 50,000 sole transport operators off the road. I have no idea what the reasons were or what the motivation was of those on the other side to take away the livelihood of those people. I have 11,000 road transport operators in my electorate alone. I live just outside a metropolitan area, which is Brisbane. The precincts they reside in are normally one-, two-, five- or 10-acre blocks, and so they have access to larger sheds and larger yards for their trucks. They tend to congregate there because the operators will be: sand and gravel as that's where the quarries are located, and they'll take product into the CBDs; road transport operators shifting livestock from reginal precincts to selling yards within my electorate, shifting cattle, horses and others; single operators picking up horticulture from the paddocks and taking them into markets. If they've got a couple of trucks, they'll be running to Sydney and Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So 11,000 road transport operators in my electorate were going to be out of a job, they were going to be homeless. Their only single source of revenue is their truck. Those on the other side, through the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, put legislation before this House, under the guise of road safety—that the roads were going to be safer if we took 50,000 operators off the road. It was Senator Michaelia Cash, from the other place, who stood and fought the unions, who fought the legislation that came through—as we did in this House. We opposed it here. As a result, I stand here and say that she is doing an outstanding job in representing those 11,000 road transport operators in my electorate. She deserves to continue in that position; she has been outstanding in that position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to accountability, at the next election the Australian public will have a very clear decision to make: accountable government or, in contrast, the Australian Labor Party. We have put on more than one million jobs since coming to office. One million jobs where we have taken people from the unemployment queues, from welfare and put them into work. Seventy-five per cent of those sit with the small business sector, a sector which we have supercharged by the instant asset write-off, our tax policy and our fiscal settings. We're getting it right. On the other side, think about when Labor were last in government. In the past year, we've put more than 420,000 jobs on. In contrast, when Labor were in government, have a guess how many jobs were created in their final 12-month period of office? Three hundred thousand? No. Two hundred thousand? No. Did they get to 100,000 jobs? Pathetically, no, they did not. They created 89,000 jobs, and, as the Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation said earlier, no less than 15½ thousand small businesses went broke. There's your contrast; there's accountability to the Australian public. When a sensible coalition government is in place, the economy grows and fiscal prudency is seen to. When you're talking about accountability, when Labor are in office fewer jobs are created, government grows and taxes get higher. The Australian people have a very easy choice. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  Here we are again and, again, we are talking about the disgraceful behaviour of Minister Cash and how she continues to avoid scrutiny. She is the person who stands in her ivory tower and shouts down at the rest of us, 'You must be held accountable.' She is the person who doesn't waste a moment or a second to defame, to ridicule, to call out, to yell, or to use the most obscene language about a union organiser or a member of the opposition. Today again she has proven that she is not up to the job. She has failed again to front up to budget estimates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's step through the time line in relation to this particular issue. There were a number of times when the senator failed to do her job in a transparent way, but let's focus on this one. This is in relation to the Registered Organisations Commission's raid on the AWU offices. She misled the parliament five times. She falsely denied that her office was the source of the leak. Then she informed the Senate that it was her staffer's fault—it wasn't her; she didn't know about it. It was her staffer's fault. The Prime Minister said: 'I didn't know about it. I wasn't quite sure'—not that we all really quite believed the Prime Minister when he said that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AFP have now launched their own criminal investigation into the leak. There is still a cloud over Senator Cash. As we've learnt today, the minister under investigation was subpoenaed not once or twice but three times to explain what she did or did not know. This is a government that touts over and over again, 'Let's follow the rule of law'—until it comes to one of their own and then there is nothing but a cover-up. The minister has refused to explain the conduct of her office and the abuse of ministerial power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remember what this raid was about. Remember back to when that happened. The AWU were very clear. They were sent a letter by ROC that said, 'Do you have documentation to talk about this?' The union sent back a letter saying, 'Can you please provide us with more information.' At no stage did they refuse to hand over the information. The Prime Minister today was wrong. He stood at the dispatch box and said that that union put every roadblock in the way. That is not true. The union asked for a little bit of extra information. Instead of that, they said that they were willing to cooperate with the ROC. Instead of that, the very next day the AFP raided and demanded the documentation. The Prime Minister likes to rewrite history to protect this minister. That's what this Prime Minister does. Just what does she have on this Prime Minister that he is continuing the protection racket against her? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we all remember the TV images. The media turned up before the police. The minister tried to deny that she had anything to do with it. She misled the Senate on five occasions, only to be outed by the press gallery. Then she came in to admit that she had got it wrong. She has hidden behind her staff. She has hidden behind parliamentary privilege over and over again. Today again she has refused and failed to turn up to budget estimates, saying that it is no longer her responsibility. It is hard to believe that, for the first time since Federation, we do not have a minister responsible for the Fair Work Act or industrial relations in cabinet. We are saying that it is the junior minister who sits the furthest away. The assistant minister gets sent in to be the sacrificial lamb. Industrial relations is one of the core responsibilities of this government and of this place. It doesn't matter whether you're a worker or an employer, you need a robust system and a minister who is independent, transparent and accountable. But again the minister has failed this test. This isn't the first time; she has form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former ABCC boss Nigel Hadgkiss resigned over the fact that he breached the Fair Work Act. The minister knew about it and she still appointed him. The person responsible for ensuring that everybody in the construction sector abided by the law admitted to breaking the law and then the minister admitted to knowing that he broke the law. Just what level of scrutiny is this government really applying? Why won't they come clean and tell the Australian people that is just about pursuing their opponents?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you go to the way in which this government has misused police resources to pursue their political opponents. The minister must resign or the Prime Minister must sack her for this deliberate misuse of power and failure to the Australian people. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  This MPI today—the failure of the government to be accountable to the Australian people—has been a clear attack on the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Senator Michaelia Cash, from start to finish. I'm a country bloke and I come from a world where a handshake still means something, where a man's or a woman's word is good enough. And I have a good respectful relationship with the union leaders who live and work in my electorate, especially, I might say, in the town of Whyalla, where they, along with the rest of the community, have helped rescue the Whyalla steelworks. And I stand ready to keep fighting with them for the right outcome. They are unions who are doing what they are supposed to do—looking after their members. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems a world away from the central and national leadership of some of the union movement, where it seems to be perfectly fair game to take members' money and use it for purposes a long way removed from the members' interests. It is a world where the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, is urging lawlessness from the union. Even with dozens of their members facing court proceedings, they advocate for more lawlessness. A place where secret deals which benefit union officials and their mates, and penalise their members, is sadly all too common a place, as was detailed by the Heydon royal commission. And it's a long way from home—it's a long way from where I come from—but it impacts on the whole nation, because it raises the question of who would be running the nation if Labor were to win the next election. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of getting to the bottom of the deal the Leader of the Opposition did with GetUp!, the Labor Party wants to pursue the side show, as to whether someone in the minister's office leaked to the press and who authorised or triggered the raid on the AWU offices. The issues of substance though are the union's or official's behaviour that triggered the investigation in the first place and what part the Leader of the Opposition, in his former role as leader of the AWU, had in that deal. The Registered Organisations Commission is trying to discover whether the Leader of the Opposition donated a hundred thousand dollars of union members' money to GetUp! without the authority of his executive. Instead, Labor wants to know who pointed the finger—who put the Federal Police on the path, trying to find out what happened to members' funds and whether they had been misappropriated—not whether the crime had been committed. It's a very old but good piece of advice, and I suggest that Labor takes it: don't shoot the messenger. Don't get bogged down on who blew the whistle. Do the right thing and find out if union members have been ripped off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should just reflect on this. The union, we are told, took the money from the coal workers to support GetUp!, which is implacably opposed to their industry. Why would they do that? Perhaps they didn't. Perhaps it was the Leader of the Opposition's sole decision. Perhaps he didn't have the authority of his executive. So why not produce the evidence, if the evidence is there? Why not produce the minute, the note, whatever it was? Surely the union wouldn't give a hundred thousand dollars to an organisation opposed to coalmining when the dues have come from their coalmining members without at least discussing the decision. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, Australians are increasingly concerned about where the Leader of the Opposition's loyalties lie. While he continues to receive millions of dollars from the CFMEU, the most lawless union in the land, Bob Hawke, Peter Beattie and Kevin Rudd have all urged him to sever ties. Hawke says he should do as Hawke himself did, with the outlawing of the Builders Labourers Federation, deregistering them from the ALP, but the Leader of the Opposition remains tied to the purse strings of the CFMEU. The Leader of the Opposition's past is littered with secret deals. The Chiquita Mushrooms, Cleanevent, Cirque du Soleil and Melbourne and Olympic Parks Trust deals have all benefitted the union. And the union bankrolls the ALP, but it has penalised the workers. It's a desperate act trying to defend the Leader of the Opposition in this time. Maybe it's a little bit like <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">t Bernie's</span>. The Labor Party is desperately trying to keep this figure alive until the next election, hoping beyond hope that they can keep him in protection until that time. Meanwhile, the opposition leader, through his proposals for the tax system, is going on his repeated escapade of confiscating cash from people who have earned it in a fair and proper way—mechanics, policemen, nurses and teachers—and taking franking credits away from retirees. It is disgraceful. That is where accountability lies. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Today's matter of public importance is indeed incredibly important, but before I talk on that I just want to pick up on the member for Grey's assertion that the Labor Party is somehow whipping up the sideshow on this. I might point out to the member for Grey that the AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin himself, said that a media tip-off would 'potentially put officers in danger and compromise operations'. This is far from a sideshow. In fact, this is the core business of the AFP, and it should be the core business of your minister. This government has ultimately failed to be accountable to the Australian people, and this minister, the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, has ultimately failed in her ministerial responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even a cursory glance at the definition of ministerial responsibility will tell you that a minister is ultimately responsible for the actions of their department, even without the knowledge of an infraction by subordinates. The minister approved the hiring and ongoing employment of those civil servants. The cabinet minister ultimately bears responsibility for the actions of their staff. I say to you: if Minister Cash didn't know what was going on in her office then she's incompetent, and if she did know then she's handling the truth very recklessly. I would say to you, as a newly minted opposition backbencher, that, if my staff tipped off the media about anything, I would know, and, if I didn't know, there would be problems. So how can she possibly stand in this place and say, 'I didn't know; I don't know; my staff didn't do anything,' seven times, and then come back to that same committee and recant and say, 'Oh, a staff member did it without my knowledge'? I say 'bunkum' to that, absolutely. She misled the Senate five times, falsely denying that her office was the source of the leak. It is truly disgraceful.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone mentioned whiteboard walking. <span style="font-style:italic;">Game Of Thrones</span> might have White Walkers, but I say that this government has the ultimate destructive force: Senator Michaelia Cash, who is the whiteboard walker—absolutely. She believes that she is above her ministerial responsibility. She believes she's above the parliament. She believes she's above the law, rebuffing a subpoena by the Federal Court and, incidentally, having the Commonwealth lawyers being paid to rebuff that. And now she thinks she's fit to serve.

Then she is quoted as saying: 'I have issued instructions for the subpoena to be set aside. I do not intend to play the court process out publicly.' So, on one hand, at some level it's okay to call in the cameras on an AFP raid, but there's nothing to see here publicly, folks, when the minister who is responsible is being called to account.</span>

We often talk about the court of public opinion in this place. I would say to you that in no court in this country, whether it be the court of public opinion or the court of law, would this stand up, and it won't stand up. It really won't stand up.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If her staff somehow decided to tip off the media without her knowledge, I want to know: what did the Prime Minister know as well when he had that meeting with her and her staff? The other question that I think really needs to be asked is: who did make the phone call to the Registered Organisations Commission? I think that's a really interesting question to ask, because that person apparently, when they made that call, said that they were fearful that documents may be destroyed or tampered with. So I think that's the other big question: who made the call to the Registered Organisations Commission? Who made the call—or was there more than one who made the call? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs SUDMALIS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  Earlier today, Labor implied that we, on this side, are not here to support Senator Cash. Let me outline some of the ways that inspire me to see the work and effectiveness of Senator Cash: firstly, with the road transport remuneration tribunal, saving so many truck businesses in my electorate and so many families from losing their income; secondly, while visiting Gilmore to help the PaTH program awareness level, talking with and inspiring some of my mentors and jobseekers to make a difference in their life; thirdly, talking in detail about the difficulties faced by the job service providers, and how we can make it better; then facing off to the unions, who have, in my region, bumped my local contractors off local construction jobs. I find Senator Cash to be one of the most effective ministers I have worked with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see the Labor Party, in a blazing rage, calling the government to account over issues of supposed public interest and parliamentary process—in this place it's rare for me to point out the obvious, but really?—turning the debate into a commentary of vitriolic criticism. During the 43rd Parliament—which, as everyone knows, was one of tight numbers, an almost-hung parliament—there was a member of the Labor Party who occupied his seat for almost 18 months, guilty of wrongdoing, as later determined by the courts, but doggedly remaining as an elected MP. Shame, Labor, shame! Those on the opposition benches are very forgetful. That MP, while serving as member for Dobell, was investigated by the Fair Work Commission for nearly four years over allegations that he used his Health Services Union credit card for improper purposes. Where was the accountability back then? He shouldn't have remained in the parliament at all, looking at his biography. It appears that he was born in New Zealand, and we all know what happens to members in this House under such circumstances. But did the Labor Party make itself accountable to parliament? No, it did not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to another situation where Labor has failed to be accountable to the Australian people. Last year, there was a definitive court ruling for members of parliament—incidentally, all coalition members—and their citizenship. Yet Labor allowed three of their party to remain in parliament, assuring Australians that Labor had a rolled-gold vetting process and everyone on their side was clear. Following the further court investigation of a Labor senator, we're now faced with three by-elections that could and should have taken place last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor rants that the Turnbull government has failed our country. Is it a failure to have a strong economy that creates over a million jobs? Is it a failure to have regional investment that would develop over a thousand jobs in Gilmore alone—millions of jobs nationally; thousands of jobs locally?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is one of the best countries in the world in which to live, work and raise a family. We all know that. However, we face global uncertainty and cannot take our prosperity and security for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, I'd like to remind Labor that they say they look after the low-income workers, but, in reality, that couldn't be further from the truth. Who negotiated the enterprise agreements for low-paid workers at Woolies, Subway, Kmart, Target and a range of other major international companies—as to which, by the way, Labor didn't want to support changing the taxation laws? Why, the unions, of course! And many of these people have hourly rates that are less than the changes proposed by the Fair Work Commission in the next rounds of changes. Labor are not looking after the low-paid workers. But do we ever have that information put forward for the workers? No. Labor say they are protecting the workers. Well, they're not. It's an absolute lack of accountability to the Australian people, especially these union workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on the government benches are determined to make life opportunities and prospects better for every Australian. We know that we are accountable at all times and look after all of our people at all times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the whole issue of putting this investigation on the table and saying it's a problem: what are they hiding? That money was taken from union members. It was hard-earned union members' money. And let me tell you: it's not a couple of bucks a week; it is a significant amount of money. It should be in their pockets. And if not, it should be used for their purposes if they get into strife. I have hundreds of union members coming to my office and saying, 'I've rung the union; they won't help me.' So what the hell are they paying their dues for? Seriously, it is, yes, numbers—conflated statistics presented by Labor. Australia won't be conned anymore by the inflated lies that are being presented right now by the Labor Party. And they should absolutely know better.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265585" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  It is with such pride that I stand here today to provide certainty to the two million Australians who live up and down the Murray-Darling Basin. Today is a historic moment for this nation. As the member for Watson so eloquently put it this morning, since Federation we've never had an agreement on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, but this parliament today sets forth on a new direction for the people of Australia, and for those two million Australians. And as he quite eloquently also put it: this isn't perfect; it was never going to please everybody, but it was the best plan to give the best outcomes to the environment and to our farmers—for the social and economic benefit of this nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I wasn't in this parliament when the plan came to be in 2012, I'm proud to say that I'm here to implement it as the new water minister. And I do it with some pride, because I know the personal stories of the hardship that this has caused to communities and individuals, and it's driven me to make sure that I have been determined to get outcomes rather than play politics. It's beholden on me to talk about some of those brave people whose livelihoods and lives we've impacted over the last five or six years. One in particular, who always will stick with me, is a young agronomist in Dirrinbandi, who, in tears, told me that because of the uncertainty he was unable to employ a second agronomist. So he was doing 17 hours a day of work, to the point of exhaustion. He rolled his ute, nearly killing himself and leaving a young family behind. I have seen fear in the eyes of a young man who wants to get ahead and wants to be in a nation that gets a fair go. That's driven me to make sure we've got outcomes. I've seen hardened men brought to tears over this—hardened farmers that have seen far, far greater adversity in their lives, but this has broken them to their absolute core. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And there are the business owners. A business owner that I met had been 40 years in the one business. Now, basically because of the uncertainty, his business is worthless—not worth a cent. He had no superannuation. He had a mental health plan. They were trying to keep him alive, let alone keep him in his business. These are the lives that we've impacted. These are the livelihoods of people that we are today going to fix. This bill will set us on a journey of bipartisanship to rectify that. I thank those opposite for coming on this journey. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Water Amendment Bill 2018 will allow us to re-introduce the Northern Basin Review back into parliament. We were fortunate enough to have the sustainable diversion limit disallowance defeated the other day, with the assistance of the opposition. I sincerely thank them for that. This now sets us on a journey to complete the plan on time, in full. Can I say that the member for Watson, who has been forthright and honest in all negotiations with me during this journey, has ensured that we not only have in place a plan that was created in 2012; we've built on it. We've built on it to ensure that there is now compensation to the extent of economic reconstruction for some of those communities that have been hurt severely by the buybacks of water that stripped the livelihoods of businesses—like the gentleman who I just talked about who owns a business and is on a mental health plan. It's about trying to reconstruct their economy, with a $20 million injection into changing their industries away from irrigation and into other agricultural pursuits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's also about compliance. It's about making sure there is integrity in this plan, whether it be from Queensland to South Australia.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are doing the right thing, you have nothing to fear. If you are doing the wrong thing, you are going to get caught. We'll be instituting a Northern Basin Commissioner to ensure that compliance by the states is upheld. That's a practical and sensible solution. That's something that gives integrity to this plan, which all Australians should be proud of, because we know that it will be sustainable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I'm most proud about is the fact that we've made, for the first time, an investment for Indigenous Australians. As I sat in St George and listened to an elder whom I respect above all, Ronnie Waters, he told me that basically he had been forgotten in this whole plan and that he was not empowered to do something about it. I'm proud to say, and as the member for Watson said so eloquently this morning, this is probably a world first. We've ensured that we are now empowering Indigenous Australians to purchase cultural water for economic purposes. They have a place in this. They have a traditional ownership of this. They have a cultural feel for that water. When you sit there under a tree with Ronnie Waters and listen to him talk about water being in that river, passing on his culture to the younger generations of St George, not only Indigenous but white Australians, it bridges the gap more than anything else in regional and rural Australia. I'm proud to say that we've made that commitment. It was important to me. I'm pleased to say that the member for Watson came on that journey with me. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This plan was always about goodwill and trust, but over its journey we haven't had that. We've had vitriol and name-calling. I was never going to get into that. This was far too important. Those people's lives and livelihoods which I have been talking about were always inside me. It worried me that, unless we got this right, unless we set out on this journey now, it would fall apart and we would never have another opportunity to get it right again. I was determined for those people who had touched me during this journey to make sure that I got it right for them. I'm pleased to say that the member for Watson has done that every step of the way. The member for Watson was honest. He was forthright. He acted with utmost integrity in all our negotiations. We didn't all get what we wanted, but he made sure that we were honest with one another, that we held our hands out to each other and that we would walk out of this place having delivered something that was historic for this nation. This nation should be proud that we have a parliament that works, a parliament that will ultimately deliver a plan for the Murray-Darling that has never been done before. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to say that the member for Watson is the architect of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—something which he should be profoundly proud of. I'm proud to say that I have been here to deliver it. I'm proud to say that I put my hand out, he's taken it, and this parliament will now deliver the certainty to the two million Australians who have been impacted, who have been fatigued, by this issue for so long. Today we give them certainty. So, to those opposite, I say: thank you for the honesty and integrity that you have shown. I say to this nation: you should look at this parliament and see that it does work. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fenner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House calls upon the Government to seriously tackle phoenixing and the black economy, including by urgently introducing legislation requiring every company director to be issued with a unique Director Identification Number”.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of years ago, the Australian Taxation Office conducted a number of audits into illegal phoenixing activity. Following one of those audits, a Tasmanian business owner was charged with fraud for phoenix activity, which was alleged to have involved an original company that operated a chain of restaurants. According to the charges, the owners sold all the plant and equipment to another company, but didn't get paid. They moved the restaurant leases to the other company and then they put the original company into liquidation, leaving creditors with access to no assets. This is classic phoenixing activity in which a firm is deliberately burned and its assets moved to a new company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dodgy directors are in the minority but those who do it hurt their creditors, hurt taxpayers, hurt workers and hurt honest businesses. We have estimates of the cost of phoenixing activity in Australia. They're old estimates, because the government hasn't yet released the updated PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates, but even those outdated estimates suggest that phoenixing activity could cost every person in Australia $100 a year or more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a plan to crack down on dodgy phoenixing activities. Over a year ago we announced that a Shorten Labor government, through a package of measures, would crack down on dodgy phoenixing activities. That package was based upon work done by the Melbourne Law School and Monash Business School phoenix research team. It included increasing the penalties associated with phoenixing activities, introducing an objective test for transactions depriving employees of their entitlements, clarifying the availability of compensation orders against accessories and consulting on targeted integrity measures, based on those recommendations from the phoenix research team.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the principal measure underlying Labor's package, announced alongside the member for Gorton, was to ensure we have a director's identification number, with a 100-point ID check, because the extraordinary thing in Australia today is that it is tougher to open a bank account than it is to register as a company director. That means that a small minority of dodgy directors are setting up under multiple names, burning companies, and then re-registering as new company directors under a different name. To recognise how easily this could happen, I have to say that a backbench member of the government, a Liberal Party representative in this House, was registered under multiple names as a director. In that instance, I'm sure the error was inadvertent, but the fact that it could happen so easily to a member of the federal parliament illustrates the problem we're battling here in cracking down on dodgy directors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax commissioner, Chris Jordan, said in response to answers to one senator that the current law was so easy that you could almost register your dog as a company director. That's why, on 24 May 2017, Labor announced that we would act. We would insist that all directors have a director's identification number. That's 371 days ago and we are yet to see any action from the Turnbull government. That's despite the fact that, in principle, they are supportive of the measure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 12 September last year, the coalition belatedly announced that they would follow in our footsteps with the director's identification number. That's 260 days ago. For 260 days the dodgy directors have been able to continue burning firms, hurting taxpayers, workers, and honest businesses—260 days in which dodgy directors have been able to siphon money out of our economy, yet the government has failed to act. It is 371 days since Labor said we'd act on dodgy directors. It is 260 days since the coalition said they would act on dodgy phoenix directors and we've still seen no legislation in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this bill are unexceptional. They deal with the use of electronic sales suppression tools, prohibiting their production, distribution and possession to incorrectly keep tax records. The measures in this bill require entities having an ABN providing courier or cleaning services to report to the Australian Taxation Office information about transactions that involve engaging other entities to undertake those courier or cleaning services for them. But the measures missing from this bill are the critical ones. We need action to crackdown on dodgy phoenix directors. While the government is unwilling to crackdown on dodgy phoenix directors, it isn't taking the critical action which the experts recognise is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just Labor that believes we need to crackdown on dodgy phoenix directors. We have seen a plethora of organisations, across the political spectrum, saying that we need to stamp out this activity. Really, this activity is like tanking in AFL: it's failing to do your best, deliberately sucking resources out of one company and moving them into another company. We have seen the Productivity Commission, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and the Australian Council of Trade Unions calling on the government to introduce a director identification number. The government have said that they will do it. They said 260 days ago that they'll do it, but there are still crickets when it comes to real action on dodgy phoenix directors. These measures may well add to the budget bottom line, but when we look at the budget papers the only revenue impact is an asterisk. It is an unquantifiable addition on to revenue, but it is an expense of a total of $40 million over the forward estimates. We certainly hope that these measures in the bill that we're debating today will add to the budget bottom line. But, as it is, we have unquantifiable impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing the prevalence of the black economy is absolutely critical, but it's Labor's leadership on this issue which has marked the true difference between the political parties. Australians should not have had to wait more than a year for this government to introduce a director identification number. When it comes to their proposed amnesty on employers who haven't paid superannuation for the past 25 years, that has been announced and they are trying to implement it straightaway. But when it comes to action on dodgy directors, they are as slow as a wet week. They are failing to act on the dodgy phoenix directors who are costing the Australian economy billions of dollars. Labor will act. A Shorten Labor government will crackdown on dodgy phoenix directors because we want to ensure that honest businesses, workers and taxpayers aren't being hurt by this egregious activity.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018, and I commend the minister for introducing it to the House. In case any members of this House or, indeed, any residents of Australia are in any doubt, I would like to briefly draw on the words and work of the Black Economy Taskforce. The task force was convened by the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, the honourable member for Higgins, and chaired by Michael Andrew, AO. I note that the interim task force report stated as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The black economy refers to people who operate outside the tax and regulatory system or who are known to the authorities but who do not correctly report their tax obligations. It encompasses a wide range of practices, including understatement of takings, the payment and acceptance of cash wages off the books, welfare fraud, sharing economy contractors not declaring their income, grey trading, activities in the so-called dark web, moonlighting and phoenixing (where businesses deliberately liquidate to avoid paying employees and creditors). Complex interactions with illegal activities, including money laundering, must also be taken into account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, it encompasses a wide range of activities, including those involving organised crime to not declaring income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government requires resources to function. As we all know, taxation is essential for every government program or initiative from our defence and border security to Medicare, the NDIS and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which saves the lives of so many Australians every year. Funding our social welfare system and our education system and the billions this government is pouring into infrastructure and development in our communities—all these essentials require taxation revenue. Government revenue is critical to every process or action in the aid of Australia, so it's in people's interest and the nation's interest to be addressing the issue of the black economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the black economy is estimated to be worth up to 1.5 per cent of GDP, or $25 billion in current dollar terms. That's an enormous figure. There is a huge amount of money circulating outside the Australian tax system. I think we should also note that, in terms of employees being part of the black economy and superannuation not being paid, it's often the workers who are the victims because they don't get the benefits of superannuation and wages can be underpaid. In some cases these workers don't receive any superannuation at all. Again, the sum of $25 billion is absolutely vast. The point of this is that, if we want those services and if we want our workers to be looked after, then this issue does need to be addressed. That is the price we pay for living in a society that provides the infrastructure and the services that are required to function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Black Economy Taskforce looked at particular occupations and industries that are more prone to operating outside of our tax and superannuation systems. Under the taxable payments reporting system, the ATO has already experienced a lift in contractor tax compliance and reporting of income by participants in the building and construction industry. It, therefore, makes sense to extend this reporting system, which the bill does through schedule 2. It addresses two industries—courier and cleaning services. Courier and cleaning services businesses will be required to lodge a simple annual statement with the Australian Taxation Office. This statement will essentially identify payments they've made to other businesses for such services—that is, if they subcontract cleaning or delivery services, they need to identify the annualised payments made to those subcontractors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extending the taxable payments reporting system is a simple measure—and a simple reporting commitment, for that matter—that will contribute around $132 million to essential government services over the forward estimates. Again, very substantial dollars will flow to the federal government. It will close the loop on reporting and payments in these industries and, indeed, could be extended to other cash-intensive industries should it become necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the amendment to schedule 2, the government has acted on concerns raised by stakeholders that mixed businesses providing courier or cleaning services may have a disproportionate compliance burden where the provision of those services is merely a small part of the overall activity of the business. The introduction of the threshold test will mean that businesses that receive payments for courier or cleaning services that are less than 10 per cent of the business's overall GST turnover for the reporting period will be exempt from reporting the payments they make to contractors commissioned to complete these services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another feature of the bill is that it creates offences for the manufacture, distribution, possession, sale and use of electronic suppression tools—that is, the software that deliberately distorts records of businesses so that they can reduce their tax. As this House has already heard, this software has no legitimate purpose. According to the OECD, the use of this software has been spreading globally and has been specifically identified in Canada, the United States, Germany and Sweden, and these jurisdictions are moving on the issue. They're not going to tolerate it, so it's important that this government and Australia also take steps to crack down on this as well. There are no reasons for Australian businesses to be using these suppression tools. This is an important and timely measure. I think that most Australians would be supportive of not only this measure, but the whole bill. So I would like to thank the minister and the task force for its work, and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  I'm speaking in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018 amendment moved by the member for Fenner, which calls on the government to begin taking seriously the issue of tackling phoenixing and the black economy:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… including by urgently introducing legislation requiring every company director to be issued with a unique Director Identification Number".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate the member for Fenner for the work that he has done in this area over the course of the last couple of years. He's been working in particular with small businesses, with workers and with members of the Australian public on this issue of the black economy. This work will ensure that the true amount of revenue flows into government coffers so that we can adequately fund the important social services that we need, such as investment in hospitals and Medicare, properly investing in schools, investing in a decent TAFE system so that people get a tertiary education to give them a good start in life, and ensuring that we're investing in universities—all of the areas where we've seen substantial cuts in funding from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't simply accept the status quo, that the government just prioritises tax cuts for big businesses rather than tackling some of the issues behind the scenes about businesses paying the right amount of tax and disclosing the right amount of tax. If we're going to build a stronger budget and a fairer tax system, we need to make sure that we're closing some of those loopholes and tightening laws. Instead of unwanted and unwarranted tax cuts for the top end of town, we should be cracking down on those companies and employees who are clearly operating outside the law. That's why we need to put the spotlight on the black economy, which the ABS estimates is costing at least $25 billion. Most experts agree that this figure is growing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there are dodgy labour hire firms paying casuals cash in hand, which means lower wages for workers, no superannuation contributions and tax avoidance by those companies. We know that the so-called gig economy jobs are inflicting industrial-scale underpayments on many people who are working in these emerging industries. We know that ABN fraud sees the use of multiple or incorrect business numbers to avoid paying tax, to avoid paying clients and to avoid paying workers. And we now know about phoenixing, which is where companies liquidate their businesses in order to dodge the debts that they owe to employees and creditors, and then, hey presto, they pop up a week later operating under a different name—truly unconscionable conduct. These problems have been left by this government for too long, despite a number of calls for reform to be undertaken in this area. You can't be serious about budget repair and stronger surpluses while standing by and allowing this kind of industrial-scale tax evasion to go unchecked. It really is all about priorities. The Turnbull government clearly aren't serious about tackling the blight of the black economy if they're not delving into those issues of phoenixing and looking at issues such as registration numbers for company directors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only in September 2017 that the Turnbull government finally announced that it was taking action on phoenixing activity, including that it would finally introduce some of those reforms that Labor had been talking about for some time, including identification. Because of the slow nature of this reform, dodgy directors have been able to continue scamming honest businesses, employees and taxpayers. At present, the registration of an Australian company simply requires the name, address, and date and place of birth of each of the office holders. It obviously makes it too easy for fraudulent activity and for directors to escape their obligations. The phoenix operators are allowed to run rampant in our economy in areas like construction and labour hire. They're giving good directors a bad name and they're ripping off honest workers. The government needs to get serious about tackling phoenixing and the black economy, including urgently introducing legislation requiring every company director to be issued with a director identification number.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The case for such a move is clear. In requiring prospective directors to quote their numbers when incorporating a new company, ASIC would then be able to be given a detailed picture of the company and its management. With more information and more transparency, dodgy directors can be tracked via ASIC and through other government agencies. The unique identification number is also crucial for small businesses and liquidators to access information on directors, including accurate information about director histories. Yet the government hasn't clarified whether acquiring a director identification number will require a 100-point identity check—a fundamental aspect of the proposal that was announced by the Labor Party last year. The government keep missing deadlines on a register of beneficial ownership—something that they're yet to commit to publicly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Questions also remain over the public release of updated modelling of the costs that dodgy directors impose through phoenixing activity. The Turnbull government is continuing to use figures from five years ago. Despite receiving updated costs in 2015, the 2012 estimate put the cost of phoenixing at up to $3 billion a year. The question needs to be asked as to why the government isn't using those updated figures. One suspects it's because the nature of that activity has grown and, indeed, the scale of it in dollar terms has grown as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is serious about tackling the scourge of phoenixing on our economy. Labor has been calling for the introduction of a director identification number for well over a year now. We've seen the backing of director identification numbers from a number of organisations: the Productivity Commission, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, the Tax Justice Network, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Masters Builders Association, the ACTU, the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association, the Phoenix Project—a group of experts from Melbourne Law School, and the Australian Institute of Credit Management. It's clear that there's industry support for this proposal. It simply makes sense and it simply makes sense to do it properly. For the sake of Australian taxpayers, workers and honest businesses, the Turnbull government should take a fulsome approach to implementing this director identification number. We know that, although the Turnbull government are committed in some respects to the identification numbers, they've delayed implementation due to the modernising business registers measure in the budget. They haven't given a time frame, and it's clearly not a priority in terms of registration numbers for directors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal"> We know that ideology has been overlooking facts and figures on these issues when it comes to the budget, in particular, and some of the calls from people in the industry to crack down, particularly on phoenixing activities around labour hire. Instead of focusing on the checks and balances on government, there's no consideration given to the checks and balances on the power that dodgy businesses have over driving the black economy and the effects that can have on workers, families and, in particular, small businesses, who often rely on regular turnover and payment of invoices to ensure they can continue to survive. There's no prioritising cracking down on those who are clearly avoiding community obligations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen plenty of announcements and talk from this government but when it comes to action it's been quite scarce. It took Labor, really, to put this issue on the agenda. The member for Fenner and the shadow Treasurer have been pushing these amendments and changes for some years now. For the sake of Australian taxpayers, workers and honest businesses, the Turnbull government must implement Labor's director identification number proposal in full. It's time that the government ditched the tax cuts for the big end of town and it's time they started getting serious about shedding some light on the black economy, cracking down on some of those companies that are undertaking these activities—particularly in that area of phoenixing and, of course, the wrong payment of invoices, which are some of the activities that have been identified in the explanatory memorandum to this particular bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, aside from that, I again reiterate the amendment that was moved by the member for Fenner regarding the introduction of legislation requiring every company director to be issued with a unique identification number. That is a big step towards cracking down on some of this phoenixing activity and ensuring that the right amount of taxation revenue comes into the budget to properly fund services in health, education and tertiary training.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018, and, as always, it's a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Deputy Speaker Buchholz!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about the issues facing people around tax in this country, I always think of those thousands of small businesspeople who, whether in retail or running small businesses and activities, spend their days creating commerce and opportunity for themselves so that they can stand on their own two feet and support their friends and their family. Then I think also about the hours they spend at night working through paperwork: the obligations, the regulations, the BAS statements and the reporting requirements under the tax system which take them away from their family, their loved ones and their friends. I have always thought that the very basis of any just tax law is not just that people pay their contribution to the collective aspiration we have for our society, despite our differences, but that there's a sense of justice around making sure we minimise obligations and the burden that is placed on those people to adhere to the tax act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax—paying tax—is not a privilege. Paying tax is a responsibility. Paying tax is a burden. It's when the government comes and takes away from people, compulsorily, their hard-earned work—the reflection of that work in their money. But part of making sure that you have a just tax system—and I put the emphasis on the word 'just'—is that everybody contributes fairly and that the tax system treats everybody equally: we don't have special legal privileges, we don't turn a blind eye to those who seek to avoid their tax and we make sure we capture as much of the economic activity that is engaged in in this country as possible. If we don't do that, if we overburden those mums, those dads, those fathers, those mothers, those brothers, those sisters—everybody who is making a contribution to paying the tax system and keeping it afloat—then what we are doing in giving people a free pass, where they do not have to contribute, is passing the buck onto those who are doing the right thing to benefit those people who can find their way out of it. That is, in the end, an unjust nature in our tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a very good book written a few years ago called <span style="font-style:italic;">For Good Or Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the Course of Civilisation</span>. It is a synopsis, looking at the history of taxation. I know it's something that will excite many members—a book on the history of tax—but it is a good read. When you read it, there are some very clear points about tax and how you have a just tax system to support a society, particularly one that either declines or succeeds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A successful society has a taxation system that is actually relatively simple. It has relatively simple and clear rates so that people have no incentive to avoid it. But, critically, it has relatively low rates as well, and—importantly—everybody makes their contribution to the tax burden necessary to provide for the nation. When it becomes narrow, when it becomes high, when it falls onto the few rather than the many, and when there are incentives and ways and means that people can minimise their obligations, those who can, do. Let's face it, that's many of the problems at the heart of the tax system that we have in Australia today. It is a system that encourages people to minimise their obligations, to set up complex structures to try and minimise their contribution to the tax system. Increasingly, it is a narrow base of people who are paying tax, and they are people earning an income within a defined age range and, principally, at a particular income-earning age. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every policy around tax and the economy I look at from that basic perspective. How do we make sure that we reverse that trend? And how do we make sure that we have a regulation or system that works for the decent, hardworking, honest Australians in the real economy, not the black economy. The people in the black economy are those who seek not just to avoid legality of their trade and commerce but to minimise their contribution to this nation. In many cases, they take advantage of the goodwill and aspirations of every Australian. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the hallmarks of the coalition's historic success is its balanced, evidence based approach to taxation and who shares the burden of our society. We reject attempts by those in the opposition and other minor fringe parties, where we say it should fall onto the few in favour of it falling onto the many, to the millions of Australians who share a collective responsibility for the nurturing of our nation. If government sets the rules for enterprise, then the basis of these rules should enshrine a sense of justice at the heart of it, that there be a level playing field for the Australian entrepreneurial and business community. When it comes to just taxation, our framework should be simple and, as I outlined before, non-discriminatory. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is designed not to add more regulation but to protect our non-discriminatory tax system against the scourge of tax evasion by those who engage in black-market activity. On average, small-business owners spend three hours a week invoicing, bookkeeping, reviewing banking contracts and reporting their tax liabilities. That is time taken away from creating wealth, growing opportunity. It is time taken away from family and friends. It is the human cost of a burdensome tax system that, sadly, so many in the opposition never seem to understand, probably because they've never had to do it themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is reducing unnecessary regulatory burden on business to the tune of $5.8 billion annually, but I won't try and pretend I think that is satisfactory. If the truth be told, I think that is the beginning, a start point, and there is so much further to go. Liberals do understand this burden and would never seek to add to it without justification. When sections of the economy start to chronically evade tax, you see a situation where too few carry too much. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill tackles one of the foundational ways that people minimise their tax obligations. It is one of the most modern methods by which sections of the economy undermine the integrity of a just tax system. It targets deceit and ensures that businesses report their income accurately and that those who seek to evade and operate in the black economy are caught out. Principally, it targets electronic sales-suppression tools that simply seek to facilitate tax evasion by suppressing or falsifying records or transactions. The tragic reality is, in a global marketplace, there will always be people seeking to find ways to use the advantages of each country's legislation to sell products to minimise people's contributions to them. And we must be forever vigilant. If you want to have a just tax system you have to evolve and adapt the laws with the technology to correspond with it and not engage in the cheap indulgences of so many on the other side of politics today, who constantly seek to demonise good, hardworking Australians who are setting up businesses and running them, but targeting those people and businesses that only survive by nefarious means. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that the black economy in Australia could be as large as 1.5 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product, around $25 billion. Now, let's face it, that is a concerning percentage of enterprise operating outside of the tax system, operating with an unjust tax advantage and operating where they take the burden to carry the weight of the nation off themselves and disproportionately impose it on others. A free, enterprising economy should never reward people who are seeking to do so. We should, of course, reward ingenuity and disruption, but we should not reward not obfuscation. Electronic sales suppression tools serve no useful purpose. Their manufacture and sale should attract penalties. By extending the taxable payments reporting system to the high-risk courier and cleaning industries, the efficiency of taxes, such as GST, can ultimately be strengthened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, this bill depends on this fundamental principle: we are creating a robust tax system designed for the 21st century, one that will seek to ensure everybody contributes their fair and just share. We must make sure that those people who operate outside of the law are not able to do so and neither have the power of complication nor the technology to do so. That is so that we, as all Australians, can look each other in the eye and say that we are doing our fair share.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  As we look at the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018, which is about a crackdown on the black economy, what's at the heart of this? The government has worked out that, by cracking down on the black economy in Australia, it is able to skerrick together sufficient funds to almost bring its budget back into surplus. The Liberal government has worked out that by cracking down on the black economy, as well as tax avoidance and concessions, it should be able to bring its budget back into surplus—just—by 2019. That's because a significant portion of what's planned for this surplus will come out of the funding that the government believes it will get in revenue from this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, to be clear, the black economy in Australia is significant, it is complex and it is a growing economic and therefore also social problem. It is manifestly unfair to allow some to play by their own rules while penalising business, employees and customers who do the right thing in order to make sure that we can fund essential government services. Hiding under the black economy, workers can be exploited, criminal groups can flourish, and social capital and trusts are undermined. This task force that the government seeks to establish through these rules and laws will focus on minimising tax avoidance and on money launderers, while the illicit tobacco task force that has been created will investigate, prosecute and dismantle organised crime groups operating in the illicit tobacco industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, through this process, the government has said in its budget that it will be providing additional funding to the ATO, Border Force and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue making sure that these revenues do come to government and those who are breaking the law do feel the full weight of the law. It's anticipated that many millions of dollars will come into the budget through revenue through these measures. As the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services has said, the illicit tobacco market is dominated by organised crime groups that use tobacco profits to fund their other criminal and black economy activities. The minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These strong new measures will shut down the avenues that organised crime syndicates have to access illicit tobacco to fund criminal activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the fifth year of this Liberal government. It's better late than never, I guess, that they focus on this. But maybe there are some bigger, or at least other, eggs that also need to be fried.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the government is working with the banks to provide them with a $17 billion tax handout as part of its budget, whilst also defending—as part of this budget—its cuts to ASIC, which is the law enforcement body that should be tasked with holding the banks to account. That's not all, because the government has also reduced funding to the AFP and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Not only was this government dragged kicking and screaming to hold a royal commission into the banks; it's now rewarding those that have been the subject of this financial misconduct—those that have been creating it and that it is having a royal commission into—by making sure that they will be the biggest recipients of its corporate tax cuts. But, at the same time, this government is also ripping tens of millions of dollars away from the Commonwealth agencies, such as ASIC, that should be policing the banks. The government is taking millions of dollars off the Director of Public Prosecutions, which should be enforcing the law against the banks and against those whose misconduct has been revealed by the banking royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we find that the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce is not funded beyond the current year. So there is no funding in the budget in the forward estimates. The government tries to say that it will continue with this task force, but it hasn't actually allocated it any dollars. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has revealed that there is no assurance that the funding for the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce will continue beyond June 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs to get its priorities right. It has funding to deal with a black economy but not to deal with the banks and the financial misconduct that has been revealed by the banking royal commission. It has specific funding line items in its budget for these very laws; yet—while we have a royal commission going on into the misconduct in banking and a Treasurer who has gone out in front of the media to say, 'We will throw the book at the people that have been responsible for this misconduct'—when we actually look into the budget, we see that the funding for the very agencies that should be doing that work has been cut! There's no special funding for them. If the government wanted to be taken seriously and show that it had some bite to go with its bark then it would also fund those bodies to follow up on the banking royal commission—just as it has, rightly, to make sure that this legislation is properly enforced as well. ASIC has been asking for five years for tougher penalties for this misconduct, and yet the government has done nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And still it is doing nothing, but it is at least turning its mind to the black economy. So we've had nada when it comes to looking at financial misconduct and making sure that there's bite, but we are looking at the black economy. I guess it's a start, as I say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then look at this. We're going to make sure that those who are responsible for importing illicit tobacco face jail penalties. But what if you've ripped off your banking customers? What do you get? You just rock up at ASIC and enter into an enforceable undertaking for a nice little slap on the wrist—a few million dollars sent off to a charity, quite possibly tax deductible—and then you turn around and you keep going. Where's the penalty? Where's the enforcement? Where's the looking at what's happening to your financial services licence, as has been revealed by the ABC today? Effectively, ASIC says, nothing will happen to you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, on this side, have a different approach. Labor has committed $25 million to a special task force inside the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue those who are found, through this banking royal commission, to have acted improperly. Only Labor will continue to work to ensure that the royal commission delivers justice to those who have suffered from the misconduct in the banking and financial services sector, and, importantly, that those who have been responsible are actually held to account for their actions, because it is only through that that we will see the cultural change that is fundamentally needed in our financial services sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, this government has worked out, it reckons, that it can cook up enough money out of pursuing the black economy to bring its budget back into a small surplus through the course of this budget. But, at the same time, it's going to hand over $17 billion in tax cuts to those big banks and $80 billion in corporate tax cuts overall.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the proposals to reduce the amount of untaxed tobacco being smoked in Australia, to make sure that we're cracking down on the black economy. We recognise that unlicensed production and manufacturing of tobacco products not only significantly deprives the community of tax revenue but also puts Australians at risk. The measures to minimise tax avoidance will help ensure that businesses and employees and those people in Australia that are doing the right thing get the benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But those in the Turnbull government do not have their priorities straight. They have allocated funds to help big business, through tax cuts, and they're helping their mates in the big banks by running a protection racket. Even when they finally concede we need a royal commission, they de-fund the agencies that will actually hold them to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the scheme of things, these measures will not ensure that we're supporting low- and middle-income taxpayers and workers in Australia. They are a start, but they are a distraction from the main game. We need to do this, but we need to do so much more. Only appropriate regulation of the banks and our financial services, and funding for the authorities that will hold them to account, will ensure that businesses and employees that are doing the right thing benefit, and that they are contributing to the long-term and economic sustainability of our nation. Alas, this government appears completely incapable of delivering on such a mandate.</span>

                    <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I'm pleased to rise this evening, or late this afternoon, to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018. I want to start by talking about the black economy. There are really two forms of the black economy: firstly, there are the illegal activities. There are criminal enterprises dealing in drugs, illegal tobacco, prostitution and the like that are simply operating outside of the law and that are dealing in cash. We've seen some estimates that there is up to half a per cent of GDP in that activity. The other part of the black economy is legitimate businesses that are engaging in lawful activity but not declaring the correct rate of tax or paying the correct rate of tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, when it comes to those engaged in illegal activity, we have to have a strong iron fist to crack down on that activity. That's why we've seen strong legislation on the proceeds of crime, so that if people are engaged in that activity those proceeds can be confiscated. We've also seen unexplained wealth legislation. If someone cannot legitimately explain where their wealth came from, it most likely, or almost certainly, came from illegal, criminal activity. That also needs to be cracked down very hard on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to see in the budget methods and improved resources to crack down on illegal activity when it comes to illegal tobacco. I don't think there's a member in this House or this parliament who thinks we should not do everything we can to drive down the rate of cigarette smoking in this country. One of those methods is through price. We are effectively going through a form of prohibition by price on tobacco. There is, I think, about a 12½ per cent increase in the excise on tobacco year after year after year. That will push the price of a packet of cigarettes to around $40. When that happens and when you can buy that same packet of cigarettes for around $1 to $2, lawfully—if it's a lawfully made product in the country of origin—overseas and the retail price is $40 in Australia, we will have created a huge incentive for a black market and for a black economy. So, it's very important that we put those extra resources into our Border Force and into tackling that scourge of illegal tobacco. The incentives, those price differentials, are far too great to just sit by and not do more in that particular area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area of course is legal businesses—businesses operating in a lawful manner—that for some reason decide that it is better for them not to declare their rate of tax. The first thing we can do, and one of the best ways that we can do it, is make sure our corporate rate of tax is low and fair. Unfortunately, we are heading for a situation in this nation where the rate of tax will no longer be internationally competitive. That is the situation that we face today. Since the turn of the century, about the year 2000, we have seen almost every major OECD nation lower their rate of corporate tax. The reason almost every nation has done that is they understand that if you lower the rate of tax you actually create more incentives, you get more economic activity and you get more tax revenue flowing in. Some people say, 'Oh, that's just an assumption,' but I'll tell you what: it's not just an assumption. Every single time in this nation that we have lowered the corporate rate of tax we have ended up not only with a bigger economic pie but with more company tax receipts as a percentage of GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Paul Keating lowered the corporate rate of tax, he understood that it wasn't a giveaway of money, as we hear so often. He understood that it was important to keeping Australia internationally competitive and to driving entrepreneurial activity and that ultimately it would result in a larger economy, more jobs and more revenue flowing in. We saw the same thing when Peter Costello lowered the corporate rate of tax in this nation. He lowered it from 36 per cent to 34 per cent to 30 per cent, where we are stuck today. It was argued, yes, that it was going to give away a lot of revenue. But we've seen the lowering of the corporate rate of tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, and how much did it cost the economy? Nothing. We are getting more revenue at 30 per cent, as a percentage of GDP, than we got at 36 per cent, 39 per cent and even 49 per cent. That's why it's important that we lower our corporate rate of tax. We can't have an internationally uncompetitive corporate rate of tax. We can't have an internationally uncompetitive cost of energy in this nation and also have higher wages and a prosperous economy. The three things do not go together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two schedules in this bill. The first schedule is a ban on electronic sales suppression tools. The schedule creates a new offence for the manufacture, distribution, possession, sale and use of electronic sales suppression tools for the purpose of not disclosing business income. There's simply no legitimate reason for such types of computer software. They remove transactions from electronic record-keeping systems, they change transactions to reduce the amount of each sale and they can modify GST-taxable sales to GST non-taxable sales in all instances, with no audit trail made to exist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to have an economy with a low rate of tax because we want businesses to report their sales and, strange as it may seem, be happy to pay the rate of tax. That actually increases the value of that business. If a business is able to have a set of accounts that say, 'This is the rate of tax we have paid and these are the profits that we have made,' in the long term that makes that business more valuable. So, if that business owner ever wants to sell that business in the future, showing the results that they have and their sales makes their business much more valuable for them to sell. The benefit that they get from that can be much greater than any short-term benefit they may have got through avoiding tax. So I'm glad to see this measure of banning electronic software for suppression of sales information. It's something that should be banned. It should be prohibited. I'm pleased that the opposition have given their support to that part of the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of the legislation goes to third-party reporting. From 1 July 2018, businesses in the courier and cleaning industries will be required to give annual reports to the Australian Taxation Office regarding the payment they make to businesses for them to provide courier and cleaning services. The reporting obligation will apply for the 2018-19 income year, and reports will be required by 28 August 2019. The government has acted on concerns raised by stakeholders that small, mixed businesses providing courier or cleaning services may have a disproportionate compliance burden where the provision of those services is merely a small part of the overall activity of the business. Again, that goes to making all these compliance burdens that we put on business as low as possible. We want Australian people who are running businesses to be entrepreneurs. We want them to spend as much time as they possibly can on improving their businesses and thinking of new ways of production, distribution and manufacture. We want them to be creative and come up with new products. That's what we want our entrepreneurs to do. We don't want them tied to a desk with a red tape burden, because not only does that have a direct cost; it has the indirect cost of taking away the time they should be spending on the creative and wealth-creation processes that are so, so valuable and vital to this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this government have a big task. We've almost got the budget back to surplus. We've done the hard yards. We inherited a mess five years ago from the Labor Party. We've made hard decisions. We've got the budget in sight of being back to a balance and then a surplus, and we have the long, hard road to pay that debt down. The coalition has done it before. John Howard and Peter Costello did it when they paid back $96 billion worth of Labor debt, and along the way—we should never forget that it wasn't only the $96 billion—they also paid back $54 billion in interest payments on that debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have done it before and we can do it again, but to do so we must make sure that we've got the tax burden as low as we possibly can so we can incentivise Australians to get out there and take risks. Not all of them are going to succeed, but we need enough of them to take risks to develop new products, new services and new ways of distributing goods. We need them to develop those things to drive the economy and create wealth so we can get that debt down. That's the task of our government going ahead. We've done a good job so far. Over a million new jobs in this economy have been created since the coalition government was elected. I can remember being in this chamber when we first talked about a million jobs during the coalition's first two terms. Those on the other side laughed. They sat there and they laughed at us. They sniggered and said, 'You cannot create a million jobs in the economy.' Not only have we done it; we've done it early. We've done it in a little over five years and we're going to exceed those million jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, it's not us here in government who create jobs; it's those entrepreneurs out there, taking risks, who create the jobs. We have to provide them with the legislative framework that gives incentives to those who are doing the right thing and penalises those who are engaging in the black economy; a legislative framework that gives the businesses that are out there competing every day a level playing field and the opportunities they need to succeed. If we're able to do that, we'll see in the years to come, with continued good government, that we're able to get surpluses happening and get the debt paid down so that it's not something our children and grandchildren have to inherit. This legislation is just one small piece of the jigsaw that the coalition is working on. I congratulate the minister on the work done on this and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

You, sir, make the chair; the chair does not make you. May I also congratulate the member for Hughes on such a fantastic speech, in which he explained to all of us here the importance of incentives in the tax system, because that's what this bill is about. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018 is about ensuring that we incentivise people to do what is right, not what is wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a population of 24 million people, and we very well know that those 24 million people love their caffeine. However, if we assume that each Australian consumes only one cup of coffee a day, so as to balance those who excessively drink against those who do not drink at all, we find that a total of $200 million is spent on barista-made coffee per year. Obviously, these calculations form an extremely rough estimate, yet even an error margin of 10,000 per cent would not be enough to justify the myth that Australia's cash economy is principally derived in coffee expenditure or daily purchases of a similar sort made in cash.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cash economy—or, better put, our black economy—could be as large as three per cent of GDP. In 2016, this was the equivalent of $50 billion of underreported income, money laundering, criminal activity and fraud, not merely unreported cash based coffee income. As a result of these evasive illegalities, government has lost approximately $10 billion of taxation revenue per annum. To put that into perspective, total revenue in 2016 was only $370 billion, meaning lost tax amounted to roughly three per cent of existing revenue. Further direct costs of the black economy include abuse of the welfare system resulting from claims for benefits that would not otherwise be claimed. On the other hand, indirect costs include an uneven playing field among competing businesses and lack of community trust in the tax system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to this pressing issue, the Turnbull government consequently established the Black Economy Taskforce in December 2016 to develop a whole-of-government response for tackling the underground market. The task force has made 80 recommendations to government, many of which were addressed in the 2018-19 budget. These include an economy-wide limit of $10,000 for cash payments made to businesses for goods and services; a range of measures aimed at combating the sale and production of illicit tobacco and to improve the collection of excise and customs duty on tobacco; providing the ATO with $3.4 million over four years to lead a multi-agency black-economy standing task force; removing certain deductions for those taxpayers who fail to comply with their pay-as-you-go withholding obligations; and designing a new regulatory framework for the Australian business number system. Based on figures in the budget papers, these measures will produce a net gain of $4.6 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I pause here to say that it is not about just getting more money for government to spend. This is about creating a fair system of taxation where all people, regardless of where they come from and regardless of what they do, have faith that the people in this place, those administering our tax system, are doing all that they can to ensure that our tax system is fair and equitable to those people who interact with it. The most important thing in a society is a fair society—one in which people, no matter where they're from, believe that what they put in they get out, not one where they believe that their next-door neighbour is somehow not doing all that they could to provide for themselves and provide for the community in which they live. That is the definite cancer which we find ourselves arguing against very strongly in this tax bill. If you allow people to believe, regardless of where they are, that they can get away with not making their fair contribution and not doing all they can for the tax system, then their neighbours and others in the community will believe that too. I believe in the economic textbooks it's called 'the tragedy of the commons'. Labor would never be able to achieve something like this. They are too focused on some sort of archaic class warfare wherein they snatch hard-earned money and reallocate it in a Marxist fashion. They redistribute income without valid justification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's top 10 per cent already contribute almost half the total net tax paid. Moreover, the top one per cent, about 90,000 individuals, are liable for approximately 17 per cent of the government's income tax revenue. There is absolutely no need to propagate this existing inequality. Instead of targeting the compliant wealthy, government should be knuckling down on those who rort the system and those who manipulate the cash economy, launder money, phoenix, commit fraud and underreport income. That is exactly what we on the right side of the chamber are trying to do here today. In addition to measures provided in our 2018-19 budget, we seek to legislate a number of other bills concerning the black economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill, for instance, aims to criminalise the production, supply, use or possession of sale-suppression technology. It also extends the taxable payments reporting system to cleaning and courier businesses which have an ABN. The first part of the bill, creating new offences regarding sale-suppression tools, will ensure that our tax system is equitable, unbiased and efficient for all stakeholders and all Australians. The aforementioned technology removes transactions from electronic record-keeping systems, falsifies transactions to reduce sales revenue, and modifies GST-taxable sales to non-taxable sales—all of this while leaving no audit trail. There is no legitimate reason for these tools—well, there is actually, and that is precisely what they're not meant to be used for. The new strict liability offences will target each stage of the supply chain, potentially imposing heavy penalties so as to deter the production, supply, use and possession of this technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latter part of the bill introduces compulsory reporting to the ATO for businesses operating in the courier and cleaning industries. The Black Economy Taskforce identified that contractor payments in such industries are areas of high risk for the non-reporting of income. The Turnbull government is therefore extending the taxable payments reporting system to the courier and cleaning professions. The taxable payment reporting system applies to entities holding an Australian Business Number that provide services in identified industries. These industries have to report annually to the ATO about payments they have made to contractors undertaking profit-driven services for them. Reporting these payments will improve transparency for the ATO, and will align the payments with compliance obligations of employers, who must report the wages they pay. The taxable payments reporting system has been successful. Its implementation in the building and construction industry led to significant improvements in contractor compliance with GST and income disclosure. Consequently, I believe that the introduction of mandatory reporting of business-to-business payments within the courier and cleaning industries will encourage correct disclosure of income. The payments received by the subcontractors will have been reported to the ATO by the businesses that acquired their services. This additional reporting will allow the ATO to target compliance activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, government should be sealing loopholes instead of increasing taxes on the compliant. The Turnbull government has listened to the needs of taxpayers. We are providing relief where relief is needed, and stricter policy where severity is due. Through legislation, both niche and expansive, our government is creating a prosperous economic environment. We are fulfilling our purpose as the great enabler—not the great enforcer—of the Australian society. Whilst Labor in opposition has already announced over $200 billion of taxes, we as a government have successfully sought to reduce our taxpayers' burden. At the same time, we have put an end to the debt-creating machine initiated by the Rudd government and the then Treasurer, Wayne Swan. We have established the Personal Income Tax Plan, a threefold, fiscally responsible strategy to alleviate household budget pressures and provide certainty for most working Australians. It is a long-term, sustainable scheme to reduce income tax payable for nearly every Australian. It puts an end to bracket creep and provides long-lasting certainty in our tax system. Through this plan, the 37 per cent tax bracket will be completely removed, and the top marginal tax rate of 45 per cent will remain only for those with incomes exceeding $200,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to amending personal income tax policy, the government has proposed a number of more niche changes to legislation, such as the Primary Industries Research and Development Amendment Bill. This incoming statute aims to combat the ghastly cost of a statutory marketing levy by allowing R and D through voluntary contributions. For rural industries, this reduced regulatory burden results in more time spent on productivity-enhancing innovation. For individual Australians, the removal of the levy, and thus lower costs, engenders lower prices. And for the government, as always, reduced regulation results in more resources being devoted to higher priority and more productive areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is absolutely imperative that Australia expands its research and development capabilities, as this is our future economic path. Following the mining boom, our economy has lacked impetus and direction. We were global economic leaders with our iron ore and minerals, but what do we have now? What makes the Australian economy special today and, more importantly, will make it special in the future? Where, in short, is our source of competitive advantage? It is about time that we consider the path of innovation, just like Israel, South Korea and the US. We should look to avant-garde creativity and development for economic progress. However, at the core of becoming a more innovative, efficient and equitable economy, is lower and fairer taxes, because decreased taxes, not higher taxes, represent lower costs for individuals and businesses, engendering significant increases in consumption, savings and, thus, investment. In a time where our economy is at a lag, where our confidence could be much, much higher and where progress is always at the forefront of our mind, lower taxes and a budget surplus are the way to go. This is what this bill is doing. This is why I rise to support it. This is why I commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the first instalment in the government's legislative response to the Black Economy Taskforce interim report. In last year's budget, the government responded to the Black Economy Taskforce's interim report by announcing measures to address the growing economic and social problem of the black economy. The non-reporting of income by contractors and the use of technology to conceal income are two such black economy activities that are targeted in this bill. More broadly, participation in the black economy undermines the community's trust in the tax system, creates an uneven playing field for business, fosters the exploitation of workers and results in loss of government revenue and undue welfare expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to this bill bans the manufacture, distribution, possession, sale and use of sale suppression technology. This technology has no legitimate use and allows businesses to understate their income. Large penalties for the use and possession of this software will strongly discourage its use. Currently, penalties are confined to the taxpayer for minimising their tax obligations. This is not a sufficient deterrent to this behaviour. This bill casts the net over those involved in manufacturing, supplying and using this software.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to this bill provides that businesses that are in the courier or cleaning industries will be required to report to the Australian Taxation office details of payments they make to contractors who provide courier or cleaning services. The expansion of the taxable payments reporting system to the high-risk industries of couriers and cleaning will result in improved compliance in GST and income reporting.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary amendment removes a mechanism to remove reporting obligations for businesses that provide courier or cleaning services where those services are merely a small part of the overall activity of the business. Following the introduction of the bill to parliament on 7 February 2018, additional stakeholder consultation was undertaken to address concerns that businesses providing a small portion of courier or cleaning services may have a disproportionate compliance burden. Stakeholders were supportive of the introduction of a threshold test based on GST turnover to exempt certain businesses from the reporting requirements. The threshold test will create an exemption for those businesses that receive payments for courier or cleaning services totalling less than 10 per cent of the business's overall GST turnover. If a business satisfies this test, they will be exempt from reporting the payments to the ATO that they make to contractors they engage to complete these services. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commissioner of Taxation may, through legislative instrument, amend or alter the threshold test in response to a change in risks and compliance burden identified in the courier and cleaning industries. Given that legislative instruments are disallowable by either house of parliament, any proposed change to the threshold test by the commissioner will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The introduction of the threshold test will not have a material impact on the costings as published in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. The ATO will publish guidance material on its website to assist businesses providing cleaning or courier services to determine when they need to report. </span>

Application of the threshold test for these new industries will be considered during the development of the legislation for the measure. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will read the amendment into the record for the benefit of those participating in the debate. It reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a good point from which to start. I've said in this place many times before that Australia's key competitive advantage in agriculture is our representation as a provider of clean, green, safe, high-quality and ethically-produced food. I make the point that those last two words, 'ethically-produced', are becoming more important over time as community exceptions on animal welfare issues grow, not just here in Australia but right around the world, and as people put more value as consumers on the idea that our food is ethically produced. We've seen consumers already being prepared to pay more for eggs and other products which they know have been raised in an ethical way or produced in an ethical way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, this is really, really important. And of course if we lose our key competitive advantage as a country, then Australian agriculture will not fulfil the aspirations we hold for it. This is a particularly important issue we are discussing tonight. I think most of my colleagues on both sides would agree that rarely does an issue come along that so agitates the Australian community as have recent events in the live sheep trade. I've been in this place for a very long time and I've seen a number of events do just that. But I think the recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> incident, as shown on <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span>, has caused more traffic—email and other correspondence and telephone calls—to members than any other issue I've encountered in this place in my 22 years here. Sure, it has become easier for people to access their members of parliament in more recent years. Obviously more and more people are using email. I do take account of that, but I believe I can confidently say that no other issue in our community has been bigger than this most recent one around live trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I move to the bill—which, I should say, Labor will support—I should explain the opposition's position on this trade and what future we see for it. I want to begin by saying that there is a big difference between the live cattle trade and the live sheep trade. I know that those opposite—in a foolhardy way, because they only make the community debate more difficult—will say, as sure as night follows day, that it'll be sheep today and cattle tomorrow. If only they understood how damaging that divisive approach to this debate is for the cattle industry. If only they realised that they only risk stimulating a debate in the community about cattle, rather than saying, 'Well, we don't agree with the Labor Party on this issue, but we're very pleased to learn that they have a different view about the cattle trade.' We don't want to have a debate about the cattle trade. We don't want it to be a divisive issue. We don't want that permeating in the community and therefore putting at risk a $2 billion industry in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cattle trade typically involves shorter voyages into less-harsh climatic conditions. In the cattle trade it's in the interests of both the sellers and the buyers to have those beasts arrive at their destination in good shape, in good health, ready to be fattened for markets in other countries—typically, in this case, Indonesia. In 2011 an event came along that those opposite like to talk about regularly. Whether they're talking about child care or agriculture, they seem to raise it out of some sort of attempt at political gain. But in 2011 we had a big problem. We had shocking cruelty towards animals in Indonesian abattoirs, and we had to do something about it. Quite frankly, the industry didn't give the government of the day much choice. It was a case of do everything or do nothing. So, the Gillard government was really left with no choice but to suspend, for a four-week period, a number of abattoirs in Indonesia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What came out of that traumatic event was a new assurance scheme, embraced by the industry—out of necessity, because surely no-one can tell me that the industry would have embraced ESCAS, the assurance scheme if the suspension wasn't in place; of course they would not have. But for the all pain of the pause of 2011, it allowed us to put the cattle trade on a sustainable footing, and it's been pretty much incident-free since. There'll always be isolated incidents. There's a report of one today. But I think we can control isolated incidents, and we've proven we are able to do so. Labor recognises that northern producers in particular rely on live exports of cattle, because they can't grow the cattle to slaughter weight; they just don't have the natural resources in the far north of our country to do so. We acknowledge all of these things, and we support the cattle trade on an ongoing basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sheep trade is much different. Its model is broken. The balance and weight of the scientific evidence tells us that you can't pack 50,000 or 60,000 sheep on a vessel for a four-week voyage, into the hottest temperatures, into the highest humidity known to man, and expect not to have breaches of animal welfare expectations. The Australian Veterinary Association, the RSPCA and many others have said that you just can't do it. It doesn't matter how hard you regulate, it doesn't matter how high the penalties are, it doesn't matter how much you threaten the exporters or anyone else along the supply chain, you just can't do it. It's the equivalent of saying, 'You can't leave three dogs in the car in the searing heat while you duck into the supermarket, but you can leave two dogs in the car.' It's not too good for the two dogs that are still in the car. The outcome is the same. It is just too hot and humid for those sheep to survive. I don't want to repeat descriptions of all the terrible scenes we've seen, not only on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span> but elsewhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The model is broken. Now we do understand there are many sheepmeat producers, particularly in Western Australia, who rely heavily on the trade. We do acknowledge that the live sheep trade produces price competition for them. They've got two potential points of sale: they can go to the meat processors in Australia, and if they're not giving them a good deal or the deal they would like then they can go to the live exporter. There is strategic price competition. We acknowledge that. But what is happening in this trade is that the exporters are externalising animal cruelty. They're jamming more and more sheep on ships to make more and more money. They give the farmer a drink, a proportion of that premium, and what happens then? Now our domestic processors are at a disadvantage. We want more sheep processed here in Australia, creating Australian jobs, adding value here. This is good for the Australian economy. And we don't want them in an environment where they face unfair competition because someone's externalising animal welfare breaches, externalising animal cruelty. It's not a good model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have said if we're elected to government we'll get rid of the summer trade at the first possible opportunity. There are no standards that can be put in place to meet community expectations on that summer trade. There would be probably a five-year period—the number is yet to be settled on, but I expect it to be a five-year period—where we would make a transition to something better. It will be something better for farmers, something better for processors, something better for the economy and, of course, something better for animal welfare standards. We will work with producers. We will work with unions. We will work with processors. We will work with international partners to further develop and expand overseas markets in chilled and frozen lamb and mutton, and of course in red meat more generally. This is Labor's plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's plan is a little different. The government's plan, if they were being honest in their contributions tonight, is this: rather than be upfront and honest and give the industry certainty about what lies ahead, they're going to drive them out of the industry using economic tools. We know the plan: make the regulations so tough that the trade becomes economically unviable. Where is the accompanying strategic plan for the industry that goes with that? How is this shock to farmers going to be dealt with and cushioned? If we have already started using stocking densities on voyages since the McCarthy review, as the minister asserts, then how is that affecting sheepmeat producers and how will that affect sheepmeat producers in the coming months or years? I haven't heard the government talk about that. I certainly haven't heard the government talk about what it will do to cushion that impact for sheepmeat producers. We've had no conversations in this place about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Immediately before the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> incident was exposed on <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span>—I say 'immediately before' because the minister had the benefit of seeing the footage prior to the Sunday night airing—the minister feigned outrage; he swore on our national television screens—swore! He said this was unacceptable. I was delighted to hear him say that. I extended a bipartisan hand and said: 'Look, what we need to do is fix this thing and we need to fix it on a bipartisan basis. It's the best way to get the outcome we're both looking for, and it's the best way to put in place certainty for the industry so that we don't have governments changing hands and, therefore, changing the rules down the track. If the major parties agree on a construct then changes of government won't matter.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister got off to a pretty good start. He, in fact, commissioned four reviews. One was into the ASEL—a review triggered by a former Labor government in 2013 but not pursued by this government until early 2018. He put in place what I think he likes to call a cultural review of the department. The department, of course, is also the regulator. He put in place the McCarthy review into the northern summer trade, which I made reference to. He put in a review of the regulator's conclusions on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span> incident.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind members that the regulator found no breach with respect to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi </span>incident. Of course, the Australian community were just gobsmacked. Having seen the footage on their televisions on that Sunday night they were simply amazed to learn that the regulator had reviewed the voyage and found no breaches of animal welfare standards. That can mean only one of two things: the animal welfare standards aren't sufficient or the regulator hasn't adequately and appropriately investigated the event.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We still await the review of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi </span>incident. We await that review with great expectations. We ask ourselves two months after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi </span>incident: what has changed? I do acknowledge that out of the McCarthy report new stocking densities have been proposed, as I said earlier. We now have observers on the vessels on voyages. I think we've done something in the area of vets and a few things around ventilation, water troughs et cetera. But the construct all remains the same. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight we debate a bill that imposes new fines and increases current penalties. The opposition will support those changes. Obviously, they will do no harm, but the problem is that we know that historically penalties are very rarely imposed. I suspect that there has been somewhat of a moral hazard here because the regulator looks at the events and wonders whether the heavy fines are proportionate to the crime in its mind. I suspect that increasing fines and penalties might, indeed, make the situation worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can it be that fines haven't been imposed? How can it be that breaches in the sheep trade continue to emerge? How can it be that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi </span>incident wasn't in any way a breach? I put it to the House that it's all about culture. Culture in any industry and within any regulator is all important to outcomes. Of course, when you have a minister who sends a very clear message to the sector and to the regulator that it should have pretty much a free pass, an unconditional pass, to continue the trade no matter the circumstances, then these are the sorts of outcomes you can expect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the House, even though I've highlighted this point before, that in its first four years of government the Abbott and Turnbull governments did 10 things to retard our efforts on animal welfare. Remember that I started my contribution by saying that the community expectations on these matters are exponentially on the rise. The best way you protect the industry is by responding to those community concerns by putting appropriate safeguards in place. That's how you protect the industry. That's how you put it on a sustainable footing. That's how you build for it a social licence. But, no, the new government ignored both industry and animal welfare group warnings on systemic failures, delayed the review of the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock—the ASEL I was talking about—and rejected Labor's commitment to review ESCAS. Labor put ESCAS in place. We thought by 2016 it might be due for a bit of a relook and a bit of a refresh. I thought that was a reasonable thing to do, but both the government and the NFF on the day said, 'Oh, no, we couldn't support that. We couldn't support a review of the auditing system. We couldn't do that.' They abolished Labor's inspector-general of animal welfare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister in September 2013, I announced the Labor government would put in place the Independent Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. That seemed a very reasonable thing to do. Why did we do that? It was because we could see community concern rising again about live exports, and we thought it was an opportunity to help both the sheep and cattle sectors to build on that social licence. We were able to say to people, 'That's okay. We've got a statutory independent officer looking at these things.' As we know, rightly or wrongly, the department is often accused of having a conflict of interest. People argue that the department can't be both the regulator and a promoter of the export trade. Its inherent goal in life is to export more Australian produce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we don't need to resolve that argument tonight, but we do need to concede that people need to have confidence in the system and be able to see that there's an independent statutory officer looking over the regulator, checking that it's properly investigating breaches of the standards and taking appropriate action imposing appropriate sanctions, et cetera. But this government rejected that. I appointed an interim inspector-general, but he or she had to be consolidated by legislation. The election came along, the Labor Party lost, Barnaby Joyce just let it go through the keeper and the inspector-general was no more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I gave notice today of a private member's bill, which I will introduce in the next sitting fortnight. I'll be inviting members opposite to join with me in supporting that bill. It does no harm. There's no regulatory burden, necessarily, on the sector and particularly not the farming sector. The inspector-general looks over the regulator. Let me give you an example of something else: we have the Inspector-General of Biosecurity. I've never heard anyone complain about the red tape involved there. In fact, the recent IGAB review into biosecurity demonstrates what great work the Inspector-General of Biosecurity does. He or she doesn't just look over the regulator; he or she also looks at what's happening in the process of looking over the regulator. When the white spot disease outbreak came along in Queensland, the inspector-general not only checked that the regulator had done a proper job of investigating why we had that outbreak but also made recommendations about how we might make sure it doesn't happen again. It seems like a pretty sensible thing to do. It sounds to me like something the industry should be welcoming of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, when we announced that we would reinstate the inspector-general during the 2016 election campaign, the National Farmers' Federation rejected it out of hand. They said, 'Unacceptable. It's regulation, red tape and a terrible thing. We can't have that.' I bet they wish they now had it. I bet they wish they had an inspector-general before the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> came along. I'd like to think we wouldn't have had an <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> if we had the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. I'm pretty confident, actually, that if we had that inspector-general then we wouldn't have had an <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I proposed that the minister give regular reports to parliament about live exports. It's a pretty simple thing to do: in quarterly reports, how many were exported this fiscal or calendar year, how incidents there were, how many alleged breaches and what the regulator did about it. This government couldn't accept that. They didn't think that was a good idea—nor did the National Farmers' Federation. They abolished the Australian Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, they defunded the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy, they abolished the animal welfare unit within the Department of Agriculture and they allowed exemptions from animal welfare standards without review or sunsetting clauses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the member for Gippsland knows a little bit about this. We now know that sometime last year—I think it may have been in September; I'm not sure now—Wellard Rural Exports, one of the live exporters, wrote to the member for Gippsland when he was the minister for transport.</span>

                    </a>  The minister is saying it's not true. I will say that I have read reports of Wellards' letter to the minister. I'm wonder if the minister is saying it was a different minister, because I've actually had a conversation with Wellards about that matter and I understand it to be true. But I will acknowledge that the minister has challenged me, out of courtesy to him. Wellards told me that they did send a letter to the government of the day, saying, 'You've got to do something about these exemptions with no sunset clauses. We have vessels at sea that were given exemptions many years ago and the exemptions just remained in place ad infinitum. If you don't do something about this'—and this is one of the live exporters—'then there is going to be a catastrophic event in the sector.' What did the government do about the Wellard letter? Nothing. The first we learned of the Wellard letter was sometime after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> incident, and we would still not know about it if parts of the industry hadn't started defending themselves against other parts of the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just go back briefly to the summer trade while I'm talking about the industry. Graham Daws, the CEO of Emanuel Exports, the exporter involved in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>, said on our national television screens, 'No matter what you do, you can't do anything about the northern summer trade.' His words were effectively, 'No-one can do anything about these climatic events. They just happen.' Well, I think that was the Labor Party's point. That it doesn't matter how heavily you regulate or what the standards are, they just happen. They're unpredictable, and when they come, you'll have significant mortality rates.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And with more on mortality rates, can I say again—and I do welcome the McCarthy review acknowledging this—that mortality rates aren't a measure of animal welfare standards. What we've been saying is that it's all right for 1,800 sheep to die, because that's within the mortality rates. If 2,500 sheep die, that's okay—don't worry about the other 58,000, who probably wish they had died because they suffered the whole trip. The ones which died were probably the lucky ones. But this is not a measure of standards, and McCarthy has recognised this. The government has embraced it and, of course, there will be a new way of measuring the animal welfare issues within these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm talking about culture. Culture is all-important. When you have a minister who does all of these things with the full authorisation of his Prime Minister—and let's not single out the former, the almost former, member for New England—he was just the minister of the day. Those of us who have been in cabinet know that these are decisions of government, and these were all authorised by the Prime Minister of the day. Again, I suspect that members of this government regret allowing those two things to occur on their watch, because it did them no good whatsoever and it has been damaging to the trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said that this is cultural; the minister's attitude affects the culture both within the regulator and in the industry. But it goes beyond that. It can also affect the culture in the research sector. LiveCorp is the RDC for the live export trade. We asked them a few questions at Senate estimates last week. We asked them, for example, why the language has changed about mortality rates in the live trade sector. In one initial report, the language changed from 'substantial increase' to something like 'minimal increases'. But, more particularly, they told us:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One high-mortality voyage each for 2013 and 2014 will not be included in some analyses, as the high mortalities occurred under exceptional circumstances, and would distort the study of long term trends.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What LiveCorp are saying is that when they have an 'exceptional' event, as they call it—and, no doubt, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> incident was an 'exceptional' event—they don't include it in the data because it's an exceptional—</span>

We want to rely on the science in this case. McCarthy rejected the science, the science shared with us so competently by the Australian Veterinary Association. We want evidence based policy. We don't want a government which sends the signal to researchers that it's all right to change the data to get the outcome you're looking for. That's exactly what we don't want.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to inform the House that when we get to the in-detail stages of the debate on this bill, I'll be moving another amendment—a very serious amendment, which I want others opposite to give very genuine consideration to. I've chosen not to do it by surprise in the House—I could have snuck one in during the in-detail debate—but I wanted to give members opposite the time to sleep on it. That amendment, which I will move before the third reading vote, will in effect institute the Sussan Ley bill, or the bill proposed by the member for Farrer. It will put a stop to the summer trade at the first immediate opportunity, and it will phase out the live sheep trade over a five-year period. I'll put that tomorrow, assuming the government allows us to get to the in-detail stage of this debate now, and I do ask members tonight to have a think about that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Farrer's bill is a perfectly reasonable one. Again, it takes immediate action on the science. The science is in on that northern summer trade. As I have argued, it gives our sheepmeat producers and others plenty of time, with government support and strategic guidance, to transition to something better. I want to particularly make an appeal to those people on the other side who have already publicly expressed their very deep concern about that summer trade in particular, and expressed the view that this is a broken model and there is no long-term future for this sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'll put that amendment tomorrow. Again, I want to guarantee members they'll have the opportunity tomorrow to study the bill drafted by the parliamentary draftsmen, or I'm happy to give it to them tonight. In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I'm happy to table the amendment now, which I have with me, so that members do have access to the amendment tonight and can reassure themselves that it is an exact replica of what the member for Farrer has proposed in her private member's bill. I'm sure the minister will allow me to table that document.</span>

It's a very significant industry in this country, and I made the point earlier that so many of our northern producers in particular rely upon it. Labor supports it. Labor wants it to thrive. But Labor wants to protect it as well. And Labor want those opposite to work with us in doing so.

But it said a couple of things the government didn't like, like recommending independent oversight and regulation of live exports, that the sugar code was a pretty dumb idea—I think most of us agree with that—and there were a few more as well. So, where is the PC report? It's gathering dust somewhere. You can be sure of one thing: if we win government—and we don't take anything for granted there, far from it—we'll be dusting off the PC's excellent report and revisiting some of those issues that this government has chosen to ignore. </span>

An independent cop on the beat, the inspector-general, will allow us to do that, and I believe that person can do that job very effectively.</span>

Live sheep exports are on the decline. Our overseas markets are looking for something better. So the demographic is changing and the market is changing; there's an inevitability about this, in any case. Let's be honest with the sheepmeat producers: let's tell them where we want to take them and let's take them to a better place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill 2018. I thank the member for Hunter for foreshadowing his motion and putting it on the table. I was going to accuse him of being a wolf in sheep's clothing, pardon the pun, but to the people in my electorate he's just a wolf!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of the legislation is to increase criminal penalties and introduce new criminal offences and civil penalties for conduct that is unacceptable for livestock exporters. Those who obstruct or hinder an accredited veterinarian or authorised officer, or dishonestly influence any person performing their functions or duties or exercising power in relation to an export program, will be penalised. Exporters who commit an offence, intending to obtain a commercial advantage over their competitors or, by committing an offence, cause economic consequences for Australia will face severe penalties. Under this offence a company would face a fine of whichever is the greater of $4.2 million, three times the benefit gained by the company or 10 per cent of the company's annual turnover. A director of a guilty company could face 10 years in prison or a fine of $2.1 million, while an individual convicted under the same offence would face 10 years or a $420,000 fine. Other penalties will increase from the current five-year prison sentence and/or a $63,000 fine for an individual to eight years prison and/or a $100,000 fine. For a company the fine will be increased from $315,000 to $504,000. These are very serious impositions. A criminal offence with a jail sentence of up to 10 years shows that this government and this minister are very serious about tackling poor practices in the livestock industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is that important? It's important to me in particular as the member for O'Connor. The live export industry exports around 1.9 million sheep out of the country, and around 1.6 million of those sheep come out of Western Australia. Of those numbers about 65 per cent, or about 1.4 million sheep, come out of my electorate of O'Connor. This trade is worth around $220 million to WA, so around $150 million to the people, businesses and farmers across O'Connor. I've had it put to me that 1,800 jobs are reliant on the export trade, but I would contend that many more people partly rely upon the trade, whether they be farmers who derive part of their income from the trade, livestock agents who derive part of their commission income from the sale of sheep in the live export trade, or truck operators who derive part of their income from trucking sheep from the Great Southern through to the feedlots in Perth and then loading them onto the boats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot about the trade, and the previous speaker, the member for Hunter, made mention that community standards have moved on. He's absolutely right. I think all of us who have received the emails would accept that community standards have moved to the stage where they will no longer accept the sort of incident we saw on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>. I absolutely agree with the member for Hunter on that, and that is exactly why the government is instituting these very tough measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do need to talk about some of the issues where the industry has been kicking some goals. Firstly, the ESCAS has been a great success. We are one of a hundred nations that export live animals. We're the only nation that has an export supply chain assurance scheme. That export supply chain assurance scheme has lifted the standards in all of our destination countries not only for our animals but for animals from other nations as well. I think Australia as a nation can be very proud of that. If we pull out of the live sheep trade, there will be no-one left in the Middle East setting that standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that needs to be mentioned is that mortalities on these voyages have fallen from 1.9 per cent per voyage in the mid-1990s to 0.7 per cent in the last five years. So that's a significant increase in the success of these voyages—a significant decrease in the number of mortalities. That shows that we can improve standards, and we need to continue to work to improve standards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding the Saudi market, the Saudi market in 2008-09 imported around thee million sheep, including around 20 per cent Australian animals. When ESCAS was imposed, the Saudis declined to be part of it, and so Australia withdrew from that market. I've just had a look at some recent figures. Between 2015 and 2017, on average, the Saudi market imported five million animals per annum, so that's about a 40 per cent increase in the number of animals that the Saudi market imported. Not one Australian sheep now goes into Saudi Arabia. So, those people who suggest that by Australia withdrawing from the live sheep trade somehow there will be no more incidents for sheep from other destinations in the world are kidding themselves, to be quite frank. I think that what will happen is Australia will pull out of these markets—if the member for Hunter gets his amendment up, and I'll discuss that in a moment—but if anyone thinks that if we pull out of these Middle Eastern markets that they will stop buying live sheep, that is a complete furphy. The trade will go on; the animals will be imported from other countries. Just to go back to the Saudi example, most of those sheep come out of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti. They're not countries known for their high animal welfare standards. They may well be, for all I know. I don't want to prejudice those countries. Maybe some members on the other side know of some animal welfare initiatives in those countries concerning live trade. But certainly there's many, many animals coming out of the Horn of Africa and going to the Gulf States at all times of the year, including high summer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the only move that the minister and the government are imposing. The minister, on Thursday a week ago, accepted in full all 23 recommendations of the McCarthy report. The key recommendation from McCarthy was a reduction in stocking rates, and there's quite a complex formula that will be applied to boats that arrive at a destination in the Middle East, or in the Northern Hemisphere generally, during the months of June and September. These stocking densities will, generally, reduce the amount of animals on board by roughly one-third. So that will make a significant difference to the animal welfare of those animals on those boats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hunter mentioned that the sheep in those hot conditions looked to be suffering—those that didn't perish—and no doubt it was very hot. But I will say that across the Great Southern and Central Wheatbelt part of my electorate on a hot summer's day you'll see a lot of sheep standing in the shade of a tree, and they'll be panting, because that's how they deal with extreme heat. I'm interested to see whether the member for Hunter and some of the harder-left members of his side will want to see farmers running sheep in a broadacre situation in the Great Southern penalised when the temperature reaches over 40 degrees, and those animals, just like the human beings who handle them, are suffering from heat distress. It is what happens in the farming industry across my electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another measure from the McCarthy report will be independent observers on board. With the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> incident, which happened in August last year, for some reason the footage was unfortunately not released immediately. It was held back and released at an opportune time by Animals Australia, so instead of it being possible for action to be taken immediately, we had another eight months, effectively, of the situation continuing without the government being made aware of it. So an independent observer on the boat will make sure that any of these incidents are immediately reported to the government and action can be taken immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hunter has foreshadowed that he will be moving an amendment in the immediate future to suspend the trade in summer months and to phase out the trade over five years. We all know that capital these days is very fluid. International capital will find its best home, and most of the live export operators out of Australia are internationally based. There's no more liquid or fluid capital than a live export boat, which can be directed to any port where the owner sees that it's going to make its best profit. So to say that we will phase out the industry over five years and somehow we'll adjust and there'll be this gradual phasing out is a complete furphy. It's complete nonsense. What will happen is that the exporters will see that they have no future here in Australia, and they will withdraw their ships and their capital almost immediately. That is my feeling of how things will go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm on the topic of furphies, there are some facts that have been put about in this place which I just want to challenge—firstly, that the price of mutton in WA is 20 times higher than it was 20 years ago, in 1998. Why choose 1998? You can go back to 1990 or 1991, when farmers were destroying sheep because they couldn't find a market for them. That was when the single desk for wool, known as the reserve price scheme, was abandoned and the Australian sheep flock fell from around one billion sheep; it has stabilised at about 335 million. That's about a two-thirds contraction in the industry, and obviously over that period there was a great deal of pain for growers as they transitioned out of sheep into cropping and other enterprises. So, yes, there was a period where we suffered extremely low prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, throughout that period there has always been a premium paid by the live exporters. Just the other day I had a case of an exporter who told me that he may have to divert some sheep that he purchased to slaughter. Because of the new rules, he may not be able to get them on the boat. He indicated to me that, while the live export price was around $110 per head, the maximum that he could make out of them as slaughter sleep was around $75 a head. So that's an indication of the premium that is in the market for the live export of sheep.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you close the industry down effectively overnight, which is what the member for Hunter is foreshadowing with his amendment, you will not see the price fall by $30 to $35. With 1.6 million additional sheep to be processed on the market, out of a turn-off of about 3.5 million or 3.6 million in Western Australia, you will see the market collapse. As I said at the start, it would be wrong to say that every farmer relies on the live export trade for their livelihood, but every farmer who runs sheep would rely on the live export trade, and also the processing market which spins off the live export trade, for a significant part of their income. It might be their profit for the year. It might mean the difference between making a profit and a loss. It's the same for the truckie. For the truckie who carts sheep, that extra work that he gets carting sheep off farm up to the feedlots at Baldivis and then loading the sheep on the boat might be the difference between him having a viable business and not having a viable business. For the stock agent who earns his living out of commission sales, losing that $110-a-head sale and seeing the market overall come back by $30, $40 or $50 means a significant amount of income that comes off his livelihood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I commend the bill to the House, because we on this side of the House accept that changes need to be made. This bill does implement serious changes. It will make live exporters— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:35</span>):  The Export Legislation Amendment (Live Stock) Bill 2018 is about export legislation, it is about the treatment of livestock and it is about the conditions upon which we as a civilised society allow farmers and businesses who are engaged in sheep husbandry to export those animals overseas. I want to note at the outset that the way in which we treat our animals—animals that are within our care—is an insight into our own humanity. It is not always a direct indication of how we will treat fellow human beings, but it is a pretty good indication of our underlying values as a society. I believe that we have an obligation to be good custodians of animals within our care, whether they are domestic animals or animals that are raised for the specific purpose of adding to our food supply. It makes no difference. We have an obligation to be good custodians of these animals. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 24 May this year, the government introduced this bill into the House, a bill to amend the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997. We will support the bill, but it doesn't go anywhere near far enough. Labor have announced that we will end the export of live sheep. If a Shorten Labor government is elected, we will end the live export of sheep. We will phase out that export over a five-year period and we will work with the industry to ensure that it is able to adjust. To be very, very clear: a Shorten Labor government will phase out the export of live sheep and we will do it because it is simply not sustainable on a humanitarian basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is claiming that these amendments will ensure that the penalties and sanctions available are sufficiently high to provide a level of deterrence and punishment necessary to protect animals carried on livestock export voyages. We are only here because of the footage that was aired by the <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> program on 8 April this year—a program which exposed the horrendous treatment of animals crammed into a boat, sent on an extraordinarily long voyage in unbearable and intolerable conditions. The significant loss of life, which I will detail shortly, led to a predictable public outcry. People are saying: 'This should not be done in our name. As a country, we are better than this.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The act purports to put in place a set of conditions and arrangements, and the bill puts in place some additional penalties that aren't currently available within the act. We are going to support them, because they do no harm to exporters who are doing the right thing. However, the new penalties and sanctions will do nothing to reduce the suffering of sheep, which will continue if we allow the voyages during the Middle Eastern northern summer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say to those members opposite who are complaining that they have somehow been hijacked by this issue that, in many respects, they have nobody to blame but themselves and their own inaction on this issue. The live sheep export industry has been controversial for decades. Indeed, the industry has been in substantial decline for decades as well. In the 1980s, we were exporting somewhere in the vicinity of nine million head of sheep compared to the two million head of sheep that are exported today. Australian live sheep exports fell by 1.97 million in 2013—the lowest recorded level since 1975. Now, whilst only six per cent of the sheep production market goes to live exports, 82 per cent of that disembarks from Fremantle. So you can see from this that the West Australian producers are overwhelmingly more reliant upon it than their eastern state counterparts. The major markets for live sheep exports are the countries of Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan and Oman. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have also been significant export markets during the past 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To say that this issue has crept up on the government is simply dishonest. It is not true. There has been significant public concern. It has been a matter of debate within this place and you could not have been a member of parliament over the last decade and not have received emails and letters from constituents who are deeply concerned about practices within the live sheep export trade. It has continued to attract significant public concern, and veterinary and other animal health and welfare sector concerns. From the 1980s onwards there have been ongoing incidents, reviews and reports into the welfare standards of the live export trades. These have recommended—serially—greater veterinarian oversight, more-comprehensive standards and mandatory reporting of incidents. I give you one example: back in 1985, a review of the live sheep trade by the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare found:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… if a decision were to be made on the future of the trade purely on animal welfare grounds, there is enough evidence to stop the trade. The trade is, in many respects, inimical to good animal welfare, and it is not in the interests of the animal to be transported to the Middle East for slaughter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the finding of a committee in 1985! Here we are in 2018 debating the same issue. Neither the industry, the exporters nor the members opposite who defend the practices, could complain that this issue has crept up on them. It simply has not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The export incident that has sparked the latest round of concerns occurred on a ship that the company Emanuel Exports used to ship sheep from Fremantle to the Middle East in August 2017. Around 2,400 sheep died on that voyage. The overwhelming majority of them died of heat stress. We know that this is not an isolated incident. What is revealed is that despite many chances the live sheep trade has been unable to demonstrate that it is capable of meeting reasonable animal welfare standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Exporters and the National Farmers' Federation—and it's worth noting that it is both the exporters and the National Farmers' Federation—when asked if they could guarantee that there wouldn't be such incidents in future have said that, no, they could not. Well, faced with a history of incidents, faced with overwhelming—overwhelming—evidence, we have to ask, 'Why is the government introducing a bill today that is so modest in its reach?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through a chronology of some of the events. In 1980, one crew member and more than 40,000 sheep died when a Lebanese-registered livestock carrier, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Farid Fares</span>, caught fire and sank en route from Tasmania to Iran. In June 1985, a Senate report into animal welfare, specifically on the live sheep export trade, was released. In 1989-90, trade with Saudi Arabia was suspended after two vessels, in July and August 1989, were prevented from unloading due to a scabby mouth infection of the sheep on board a ship. In 1996, one crew member and 67,000 sheep were killed when the <span style="font-style:italic;">Uniceb</span>, registered in Panama and chartered by Wellard Rural Exports, caught fire and sank in the Indian Ocean while travelling from Fremantle to Jordan. In January 2004 we had the Keniry report, which said that the industry needs to improve its standards and that drastic reform was needed. In September 2012 Kuwait and Bahrain rejected sheep shipments due to claimed outbreaks of scabby mouth. Bahrain blocked the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ocean Drover</span>, which was subsequently diverted to Karachi in Pakistan, where the sheep were culled by Pakistani disease control authorities. In January 2014, 4,000 sheep were reported to have died heat stress aboard the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bader</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> III</span> travelling from Adelaide and Fremantle to the Middle East.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From this chronology of events you can see that there has been occasion upon occasion where the industry has been sent a clear warning that the behaviours are not sustainable, that the practice is not sustainable and that change is necessary. Instead of apologising for the practices and stonewalling the inevitable change, we call on the government to do the right thing. The government could bring on for debate a bill before the House this week, introduced into this House by one of their own rural and regional backbench MPs, the member for Farrer. Members of the Labor opposition have said they are willing to have this bill brought on for debate and for it to be voted on in this House. That can be done at the next sitting of this parliament, so there is no need for further delay. We call on the government to do the right thing and ensure this private members' bill gets debated and voted on in this session of parliament. We do not need to wait until the next election to have this issue determined.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate I asked my office staff to do a count of the number of emails, letters and phone calls we have had from constituents since the April incident. There were a full 1,054 letters, emails and phone calls of complaint from constituents on this matter. When compared to most of the other issues that I hear about through my office, this is one of the highest numbers of complaints I have received. On this alone we should say that the parliament needs to respond to deeply held community concerns. We should take the opportunity provided by the member for Farrer and her private members' bill to have this issue put before parliament. We would do it differently, but we respect that the member for Farrer has brought a bill into this place in good faith. We can vote to end this cruel trade, we can do it within the next sitting of parliament, and we should do it. Our constituents demand it, and it is the right thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The way that we treat animals in our care is an insight into our humanity. We have an obligation to be good custodians of the animals within our care. Whether they be domesticated animals, pets, or animals we are keeping to supply our food chain, the obligation is the same. I commend to the House the second reading amendment moved by the member for Hunter and again call upon the government to allow its members to vote on the private members' bill, moved by one of its own members, on this issue.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">):</span>  I'm proud to say I'm here to support WA's sheep farmers, their small businesses and the communities that rely upon them. The Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill 2018 will significantly increase criminal penalties and introduce new criminal offences and civil penalties for livestock exporters. The bill ensures that penalties and sanctions provide the deterrence and punishment necessary to protect animals on export vessels, penalising those who would obstruct or hinder an accredited veterinarian or authorised officer. Exporters who commit an offence for a commercial advantage over their competitors will face penalties. A company would face a fine of $4.2 million, three times the benefit gained by the company or 10 per cent of the company's annual turnover. A director of a guilty company could face 10 years in prison or a $2.1 million fine. An individual could face the same prison sentence or a $420,000 fine. There are additional increased penalties and fines for individuals and companies. Courts will be able to name and shame those who commit offences or contravene civil penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I don't want to see our farmers, small businesses, and rural and regional communities punished by closing the live sheep trade. Of the hundred-plus countries that export live animals around the world, Australia is the only country that is invested in, and continues to invest in, people, training, welfare and education. Added to that, this legislation introduces some of the highest penalties in the world. However, the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union wants to shut the live export industry down, so, of course, Labor wants to shut the industry down as well. Labor's shadow agricultural minister was quoted in the WA <span style="font-style:italic;">Farm Weekly</span> as saying, 'Labor will shut down live sheep export.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My state of Western Australia has the most to lose. A third of WA's sheep go into the live export market. Shutting it down would have a massive impact in Western Australia. WA has averaged nearly 85 per cent of the total of live sheep exports over the past five years: 1.6 to 1.7 million sheep. Critically in our state, there is a direct interdependence between trade lamb, mutton and live exports markets—something that's not well understood outside Western Australia. The live sheep exported are mostly older sheep; they're mutton. The chilled-box sheep trade is mostly lamb. They're two different markets. We have a very small domestic market compared to the far greater domestic demand on the east coast. The east coast also has a distinct freight advantage into the US market. But, of course, as we're hearing tonight, those on the east coast actually know much more about our market in Western Australia than our WA farmers do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The live export trade in WA is worth $250 million. It supports jobs and economic development in our regions. With our predominantly merino flock, the flow-on effect on prices would be substantial. It would force people out of sheep production. Some believe there would be a collapse in sheep values that would have most impact on our producers in WA. A report I read recently put the cost between $80 and $150 million—it could be more. There's a lot of support for competition in Australian markets, but rarely, as we see from the other side, is there support for competition that improves farmgate prices. We're hearing it tonight repeatedly. This is a classic example. Labor will leave sheep producers with only one option—to sell to a meat processer and, certainly, to sell their oldest sheep. There is absolutely no question this would force prices down. The processors are probably rubbing their hands at this. But the producers know they will be absolute price-takers. There will be no competition. There is no magic transition here. The Gulf States ministers and livestock importers have said that if they're forced to look elsewhere for live animals, they'll look elsewhere for chilled meet also. Effectively, this means that, if Labor shuts down the live trade, the chilled trade would likely contract and our farmers could lose both selling markets. Just consider those who would be affected. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look, for a start—for the first time tonight, perhaps, apart from my colleague the member for O'Connor—at the human cost of shutting down the industry or cutting millions of dollars from the industry. There is the effect it will have on individuals, small businesses and small regional communities, primarily our farmers, but also farming contractors; shearers; livestock transporters; feedlots; those who grow, supply and process feed for the live shippers; pellet manufacturers and staff; those loading the livestock on the wharfs; tyre dealers; mechanics; welders; fuel distributors; fencing contractors; and the countless other small businesses and their workers in rural towns and communities that rely on local farm incomes coming into their businesses. What about livestock agents? There are over 1,200 agency businesses across Australia who play a very important part in the livestock and wool sectors. There will be families who lose income and will not be able to afford to send their kids away to school. What sort of risk are we seeing already? I was talking to a contractor carting sheep feed out the back of Darkan, and he said the word from the farmers was that the banks are already nervous. I wonder how the banks are actually pricing the increased risk sheep farmers and those dependent on the industry are currently facing when they're applying for a loan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In WA, this will impact right across the state, from the Wheatbelt through to Williams, Narrogin, Northam, York and Esperance, just to name a few. Take 35 per cent off farmers' incomes, and they cannot spend this in their small regional towns and businesses. They can't support the emergency services and the sporting and community service clubs in the same way. And how about the mental health issues? It's a massive issue already in rural and regional Australia. We're tight for feed in WA right now. Here's another layer of pressure for our farmers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't matter how the members opposite try to package this and say there'll be some sort of magic pudding transition. We all know that there will be businesses that won't survive. It's not okay for those opposite to just shrug their shoulders and say, 'They're just collateral damage.' They are farmers like me. I didn't come into this parliament to put farmers and small businesses out of work, and I didn't come into this parliament to make decisions that put at risk, erode or destroy small regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has said it will shut the industry down. Well, I was in this parliament in 2011 when the Labor government suspended the live cattle trade to Indonesia. It was disastrous for Australia's cattle industry. It destroyed some pastoralists, and I know only too well the impact on farming families in regions right around Australia and the impact directly on beef prices in the South West of WA. So Labor's ban on live cattle exports proved without a doubt that the live export market underpins the meat-processing trade prices. When live exports ceased, livestock prices crashed. When the live trade resumed, domestic prices in sale yards increased significantly. But what about that human cost? I saw the trauma and frustration of our farmers, graziers and small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are direct parallels between what Labor wants to do to the live sheep industry in WA and my dairy industry, and I speak from personal experience. The industry deregulated in 2000. I'm the only dairy farmer in this parliament and the only person who's experienced what happens when there are sudden or ongoing cuts to farmers' primary source of farm income. The price for our litre of milk supplied to a processor went from 48c a litre to 28c a litre. It was said at the time that $28 million to $30 million exited the Harvey shire overnight. We had around 300 dairy farmers in the industry at the time and around 125 in the Harvey shire alone. Now there are barely 150 in total in the WA dairy industry and very few left in the Harvey Shire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when you cut between a third and a half of farm incomes, it directly affects the farmers, their workers and the whole community. I was president of the local AFL footy club. We were fundraising to build our first clubrooms. Those cuts to our local farmers' incomes meant that we were down $30,000 a year on our fundraising. The local dairy farmers who supported us with hay, cattle and personal donations couldn't afford to do it anymore. The local businesses—the rural agency, the hardware store, the newsagent, the furniture shop, the car dealer, the supermarket, the local mechanics, the welders and the local cafes—were all affected when what was the local major industry took such a hit, just like the sheep industry. Those same businesses suffered reductions in their income and either reduced or completely cut their donations as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an industry that at the time underpinned much of the local and regional economy. In the very small town of Brunswick Junction, where I grew up, there was a strong contingent of viable dairy-farming families who underpinned the local community. The local supermarket was thousands of dollars down in its turnover in the first week following deregulation. The majority of those small dairy businesses did not survive, and the farmers left Brunswick. These were the people who were very committed to and active in the local community, just like our sheep farmers. They're the ones who financially and physically supported the local primary school P&amp;C. One of the farmers used to coach the kids in sport and in basketball and take them to and from games. They supported the local volunteer St John Ambulance and fire brigade fundraising. These families had to sell their properties for what they could get and left the district. What a gap they left, both financially and physically. We really miss their commitment to the community. In other communities we saw local sporting, community service and emergency service organisations struggle for numbers of volunteers as well as financial support. It had been the farmers who provided the physical and machinery power to get the jobs done—something a lot here take for granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who tried so hard to support those dairy-farming families during this time, I saw and dealt with the massive mental health problems. This was the real human cost and the risk involved in what those opposite are proposing. It's what you can't see behind closed doors that matters. There were both men and women who would break down and cry whenever I met them in the street or in a paddock. Some of those people never ever recovered. They carried to their graves the anger and frustration, particularly for some industry representatives and for the politicians who failed to stand up for our farmers—those who failed to understand just what a devastating effect this decision had on their families, their lives and their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no question that dairy farmers in WA are now absolute price takers. We have three major processors, and last year we saw three dairy farmers told their milk would no longer be required. There was an excess in the market and they were put out of business. No other processor would take their milk. They had nowhere to go and they had a perishable product, so they had to shut down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at the parallels with the live sheep industry. Labor wants to take millions out of the pockets of our sheep farmers, particularly those in Western Australia. We've heard talk in this place about transition, but transition to what? I've lived it and I've been there. Is it transition to processors? Well, why not come and walk a mile in my shoes. Let's have a look at what happens when I am reliant on processors; I am an absolute price taker in my industry. There is no magic pudding in this space, and there will be no magic for our sheep farmers. That's why I am very proud to come into this place and stand up for every one of those farmers and our farmers right around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we have a lot of people who take for granted where their food comes from, how well it's grown and, equally, how much of the rest of the world we feed. It is a very important job, and, unfortunately, what we see here is people taking farmers, their businesses and those small communities for granted. Look at some of those more remote and small communities it's going to have a massive effect on. If it's what I saw in Harvey and Brunswick, in those towns that actually have many more people and small businesses than those rural, regional and more remote areas in the Wheatbelt region, the compounding effect will be huge. But what about the human cost?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite think that farmers and those communities really don't matter. Well, they do. They absolutely do. Their mental health matters, their contribution to our economy matters, their contribution to the Western Australian economy matters and each one of their families matters. So I'm saying to those opposite: you be very careful what you're actually proposing here. I've been through massive change in an industry, and I know what's ahead for our sheep producers. I also know what's ahead for those small communities and for the organisations, emergency services, sporting clubs and community groups that actually rely on those fantastic farmers who support and underpin so much of our regional economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm desperately concerned about the human cost of what is being proposed. It is not simple and there is no magic transition. I've lived it and, as I said earlier, I did not come to this place to put farmers, small businesses and those that support them out of business. I didn't come here to see small regional communities further eroded or more people leave rural and regional Australia. I am always proud to stand up in this place for our Australian farmers, and I do so in this debate.</span>

I'm the daughter of a mixed farmer. We grew grain, dairy, sheep and pigs, and I too lived through a crash in a market. It was a crash in dairy in Victoria that resulted, ultimately, in my father's death. But that's not what the Export Legislation Amendment (Live-Stock) Bill 2018 is about. This bill is not about crashing a market. This bill is about ensuring that Australia has a reputation as a clean, green, safe, high-quality and ethical producer of food. That's what the amendment to this bill is about. We come into this chamber to debate a bill that this government has put forward as a fix-all on what has residents in my community incredibly concerned.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like those Australians, farmer's child or not, I was deeply disturbed and disgusted to watch the now infamous footage of sheep on board the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>. What is more disturbing than the footage itself, though, is the fact that this was not a one-off incident. The <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> program on 8 April showed on-board treatment of live sheep over a series of voyages. This segment shed light on an ongoing issue that is being left to spiral downward, without a regulator and without the teeth and the grunt for enforcement. And I don't believe that the legislation that's before us tonight will seriously change those practices.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The segment also shed light on the failures of this government, and, in particular, the series of ministers for agriculture who have done nothing. They have sat back and have allowed these incidents to occur without any kind of intervention. This government have continually failed in the live sheep export space, first with the former minister, the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, and now with Minister David Littleproud. In fact, let us go through a brief timeline that demonstrates the government's repeated failures over the past couple of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is too late now to cry, 'We need to fix this,' in terms of taking a long view and suddenly increasing fines to make things change. The behaviours haven't changed. What Labor is proposing is a transition period and a government that would work with the farmers to ensure that we can stop the summer trade and come to a situation where live exports and the farmers can continue but without the scenes that we have seen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October-November 2016, footage obtained by Animals Australia showed cruelty to Australian sheep in Malaysia and in the Middle East. Fast forward to 2018, April, and nothing had changed—same harm, no regulator. In August 2017, reports revealed that 3,000 sheep died due to heat stress on a single voyage to the Middle East in July 2016. So it took a year for that to be exposed. In November 2017, concerns that unfit ships were being used for live exports to the Middle East prompted the Western Australian government to seek to send a government official to inspect a live export vessel in the Fremantle Harbour. This attempt was unsuccessful. The result: the status quo remained and sheep continued to be loaded onto ships with inadequate ventilation on long-haul voyages in those summers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February, the Western Australian government commenced an investigation into a voyage by Emanuel Exports in which four per cent of the shipment of 63,000 sheep died. In March 2018 it reported that the live sheep export trade to Saudi Arabia was set to resume by mid-2018. In April 2018, the notorious footage of conditions on board an export ship bound for the Middle East in August 2017, released by Animals Australia, emerged. Approximately 2,400 sheep died of heat stress in this footage, and this footage was disturbing. I don't believe there's a member in this place that could see that footage and not be disturbed by it—as disturbed as members in my community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would remember the words of the member for Hunter—after the decades that he's served in this place—and his comments about the amount of contact he'd had from Australian citizens. I would echo that, that in the five years I have been in this place, I have not seen the amount of emails, the amount of letters or the amount of phone calls to my office on any other issue. And I want to share some of those here tonight.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One is from a local vet: 'I want to see Australia protect our farmers and protect our animals from this cruelty by stopping the live sheep animal exports and expanding a sustainable trade in chilled and frozen meat instead. We need to stop May-to-October exports now. We need to halve stocking densities now. We need highly trained, independent observers on all voyages now. And we need to plan how to end long-haul live animal exports for good.' These people aren't writing lightly. These people aren't similar to those in the past—just sending awful photos in the post. These people are thinking through the issues and contacting their local members to urge us to do what commonsense says we should do. Here is another from my hundreds of emails: 'I'm dismayed by the suffering of animals that I saw on the 60 Minutes program. It has absolutely stunned caring people everywhere. Temperatures well over 40 degrees, packed so closely they can't move, cooking alive. You wouldn't wish this on your worst enemy.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt about the impact that this footage has had, and there's also no doubt, in my mind, that this situation has worsened under this government. They have turned a blind eye to what has been occurring, not just on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Express</span> voyage but on other long-haul voyages. The cruelty to the animals involved in this trade needs to be pulled back and pulled into line. The farmers in this business need to be supported through a transition. I have people who work with animals in my electorate; farmers have said to me that they were disturbed by it. This should not become an argument about: it must go on or it must stop. This has to become something that this place can work and find a solution for. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government now has the responsibility to legislate meaningful reform. The crux of this bill is to ensure that penalties and sanctions are high enough so as to provide a level of deterrence and punishment necessary to protect the sheep exported. The sentiment of that is welcome. But you have to ask: where has the regulator been? Why are we seeing this footage on our television screens, backdated, and nothing's happened in the interim? These are the questions the Australian public wants answers to. They want to know why so little, so late. And they want a different answer to this question. They're not going to accept an increase in penalties when it appears there hasn't been a regulator in place to oversee and ensure the penalties are actually placed when the breaches are occurring. This bill does nothing to address the ventilation issues, it does nothing to prevent the same kind of cruelty that we saw on our television screens from happening right now. We can't go far enough into the cruelty. The people who are writing to me are not people who normally pick up a pen to write about animal welfare. They're people who have been shocked and disturbed and don't understand how we can put profits above the way we are going to be perceived internationally for the way we treat our stock. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill needs to do a lot more than it already is doing. It was deeply disturbing to read two weeks ago that the ship at the centre of the latest live export scandal passed 39 inspections over five years. Deputy Speaker Andrews, if you thought the letters had stopped, once that became public knowledge they began again. Because, rightly, people are concerned that a ship can fail to comply with the ventilation requirements but can have 39 inspections over five years and be passed. Clearly, as the people writing to me have said, something's wrong with the system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The system needs to be changed. We need to be legislating to ensure that the sheep at the centre of this scandal are treated humanely on their journey to the Middle East. That means stopping the summer trade. That means finding new solutions. Minister Littleproud saw the footage and said on the record:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I've seen the footage and I was absolutely shocked and gutted. … This cannot go on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, hear, hear. That's what the residents in my community have said: 'This cannot go on.' Yet, for all the emotive language from the minister, we haven't seen any real and meaningful reform to ensure that we don't continue to see the horrifying footage of sheep suffering on those long-haul voyages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The outcry from residents in my community about the issue has been overwhelming. We have received hundreds of emails and letters. On social media, it is hard to scroll for a few seconds without seeing a post about this issue. It is very real and very alive in my community. And I stand with those members of my community on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite want to talk about the past. They want to talk about the Australian government, the Labor government, having to stop live export in the meat industry in the past because of cruelty happening in abattoirs at destination points. I echo the member for Hunter's sentiments: things changed as a result of that pause. Things changed on the ground. And the level of animal cruelty was reduced dramatically. The industry won't change unless government acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish with a few more points that my local residents have made. 'Banning awful sheep live export means so much to me. People are disgusted by this cruelty, yet the government continues to ignore what the public wants.' I don't believe that the person who wrote that to me will be satisfied with this legislation—with an increase in fines but without the surety that there will be regulation of some kind. And I don't think that, at this point, the Australian public is going to be satisfied with anything but the cessation of the summer trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To quote another local vet in my community: 'I want to see Australia protect our farmers and protect our animals from this cruelty.' I don't think I can say it any better than that. We need to know, in our communities, that this trade has stopped—that what we saw on our television screens will not happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at the mechanisms in this trade. Is the trade flourishing, or is the trade, in itself, reducing? Is this government just waiting for this trade to peter out? In the meantime, we'll continue to see these shocking images on our television screens—post-dated, of course, by some months. It is too late now to say that we can change the density on those long-haul summer voyages. It's too late for that. We need to stop the long-haul summer voyages. Then we need to look at a real regulator in the industry. We need to transition. We need to create, working with the farmers, a reasonable transition, to ensure that their livelihoods are protected but also that our country's reputation as a grower of ethical, high-quality food is maintained.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  This certainly is an emotive issue and one that has hit the interest of the broader community. We need to make sure that we fix this industry—and by saying 'fix this industry', I don't mean 'ban this industry'. It's such an easy target just to make decisions here in Canberra that we're going to ban this industry, and to not understand, as Ms Marino has said in this House, the true human cost of the decisions that the people in this parliament are prepared to make on this issue. Banning this industry is not going to stop sheep being imported into the Middle East. The countries have explained very, very clearly that there is a strong demand for the live sheep trade to Kuwait, Qatar and other Middle Eastern countries. If they can't get that produce from Australia then they will look to other countries to secure that produce—countries that have a far poorer animal welfare standard than the one that we enjoy here in Australia and the one that Minister Littleproud is going to work exceptionally hard at trying to strengthen over and above what we currently have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Littleproud has acted quickly in relation to these revelations. The footage is certainly shocking. I think, yes, we all saw the footage and we were all appalled by it. But, again, as I said, when the Labor Party did this back in 2011 with the beef trade after some shocking vision of the slaughterhouses of Indonesia was seen, the beef trade was shut down for approximately six months. It was only when the true cost of the human pain here in Australia, the human cost in Australia, was revealed to the Labor government at the time that they realised that they had to get this industry up and going again. Of course, what happened then was that the Indonesians said: 'Sorry, we've already found our markets elsewhere. We've already got our suppliers coming in from other countries.' We have been paying for that knee-jerk decision from the Labor government ever since. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As previous speakers have said, this trade is not about the lamb trade. Australia is well-renowned for its lamb, and we sell our lamb all around the world. Most of it goes in chilled boxes. However, in the Middle East, they have a strong demand for mutton. This is more to do with the wool industry. This is more to do with the wool farmers of Australia. As the sheep get older, they are only good for mutton. We eat very little mutton here in Australia, but we can actually sell it into these export markets for a substantial premium compared to what it's worth here in Australia. Make no mistake, if the Labor Party get their way and they shut down this trade, they won't stop there. They will just keep coming after the farmers. They will go after the beef industry. It has been very, very clear, as Minister Littleproud heard firsthand when he was in the Middle East last week, meeting with ministers from Qatar and Kuwait, that, if Australia is going to back away from its live sheep trade export, these countries are also going to look elsewhere for their chilled meat. It's not as though they're prepared to replace one with the other. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to find ways to fix this trade. We've been down the path before that Labor wanted to go. We were then made aware of the human cost associated with the extra pressure that we were going to put on our farmers in Western Australia and predominantly in South Australia, which are the two major states that enjoy the opportunity to export their mutton, their older sheep. We understand that we have to fix this trade. I will go through some of the penalties that this livestock bill is going to introduce for those who think that they can get away with poor animal welfare in the process of exporting our sheep. These new penalties are substantial. What we have to continually look at are the facts. As Minister Littleproud has said, we need to make sure that we go through this with a very calm head and that we make decisions that are based on science and evidence, as opposed to emotion. As I said, last week Kuwait were very clear in their explanation to Minister Littleproud that, if they are forced to look elsewhere for live animals, they will also look elsewhere for chilled meat. So, if Australia wants to phase out the live trade, the chilled trade would likely shrink, and Australians could lose selling on both markets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This happened in Bahrain, where the removal of a government subsidy saw the end of Australia's live sheep imports in 2015. Australia's exports of chilled meat to Bahrain then shrank from 11,987 tonnes in 2014 to just over 8,000 tonnes in 2015, and was not even 7,500 tonnes in 2017. Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE import between 80 and 90 per cent of their meat. In 2016, Australia supplied Kuwait, Qatar and UAE with 60, 86 and 28 per cent respectively of their live sheep, and 68, 78, and 56 per cent respectively of their chilled sheepmeat. So these countries are currently very heavily reliant on Australia for their sheepmeat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, as I said earlier, the sheep exported are mostly the older sheep, the mutton, whereas the chilled sheep trade is mostly lamb. It must be understood very clearly that once we take this option away from our farmers we are going to leave them with one option, and one option only. And that is that they will be at the mercy of the processors here in Australia. We understand what happens then, that the farmers become, yet again, price takers. Again, having no option but to succumb to the price offered by the local processors is what waits for our farmers if the Labor Party is to have its way on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's quite pointed that the citizens of these Middle Eastern countries believe they have a right to freshly-killed meat. They have already reduced their live sheep import levels as much as they can, and they want to keep their current import levels where they are right now. They want to keep them there. So it's wrong to claim that the sheep trade is in terminal decline. The MLA analysis indicates that total global sheep exports into the Middle East have increased, with more supply from countries such as Romania, India and Georgia, as well as unknown numbers from countries such as Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. This concept that the live sheep trade is in terminal decline and that we may as well just hurry it up anyway is simply a false claim.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also the claim that the Australian export of live sheep is in terminal decline. That's also false. Sheep exports from Australia declined over the past decade in line with the shrinking of the Australian sheep flock and the wish of some Middle Eastern countries to reduce their huge reliance on live sheep from Australia. And that's happened now—that happened years ago. Our sheep flock is now stable and our live sheep exports to the Middle East have hovered between 1.8 and 2.3 million tonnes per million sheep per calendar year. That has been constant since 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other claims that we hear, that this demand only comes due to government subsidies is also false, because due to a combination of historical, cultural and economic factors, locally slaughtered animals are still perceived to offer the freshest meat in the Middle East. And these markets are calling out for the freshest meat that they can possibly get.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as I said earlier, Minister Littleproud has put together a raft of penalties to ensure that no-one will be looking to take these penalties on, thinking that they can do this as part of business as usual. This will no longer be seen as the cost of doing business, to be happy to pay for these fines. We understand that under the offence, if a company were committing an offence intending to obtain commercial advantage over their competitors by committing the offence, and causing an economic consequence for Australia, they would face penalties to the tune of $4.2 million for a company and $420,000 for an individual. A director of a guilty company could face 10 years in jail. These are substantial fines, and the fines for every other offence in this are consistent with what we have here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very, very serious issue. I implore the people of Australia to look beyond the emotion, because this is a very emotive issue—as we understand, the vision was shocking. However, if we can improve the welfare of our sheep through those summer months—give them additional space, put the independent monitors on these ships and look out for the welfare of the—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  For South Australia, the Turnbull government's 2018-19 budget was a huge disappointment. It is becoming an annual occurrence under coalition governments. First under the Abbott government, and now under the Turnbull government, it seems coalition governments have little interest in South Australia, where they currently hold only four out of the 11 seats and have limited prospects of increasing their representation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Turnbull government, South Australia is clearly irrelevant. South Australians, however, held out some hope that with the new state government and the economic setback of the Holden closure, for which the coalition government has considerable responsibility, that the 2018-19 federal budget might have been a little more generous. But it was not to be. Instead, it was a budget filled with empty promises that maybe delivered in years to come—that is, if the government continues to be re-elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to the government's talk of major infrastructure funding for South Australia, the real dollars provided to South Australia for road and rail works are in the distant future, and they are clearly spelt out in the budget documents. A joint press statement was released by the RAA, the South Australian Freight Council, Civil Contractors Federation South Australia, and the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy in response to the 2018-19 budget. This statement makes it clear, and I quote the words of Evan Knapp, the executive officer of the South Australian Freight Council:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The press release accurately points out how little of the funding for the north-south corridor, the Joy Baluch Bridge or the Salisbury to Gawler rail electrification work was actually in the budget. None of these works can take place without the full funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as disappointing, South Australia only gets $3.7 million, or one per cent, of the $530 million over the forward estimates allocated to the Roads of Strategic Importance program. The Turnbull government's infrastructure announcement is akin to its invisible shipbuilding jobs, which the member for Sturt boasted about having delivered in the lead-up to the 2016 federal election. The truth, which South Australians are not blind to, is that another 223 jobs will be lost at the Australian Submarine Corporation by 30 June, bringing to around 1,000 the number of shipbuilding jobs that have been lost at the ASC over the past three years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia's unemployment rate is now 5.9 per cent. It's above the national rate. For young people, finding a job in South Australia is becoming increasingly difficult. Infrastructure and shipbuilding projects could immediately create jobs, particularly for skilled ex-Holden workers or young people looking for an apprenticeship. That is particularly important at a time when apprentice numbers in South Australia and, indeed, across the country are falling, having dropped in South Australia from 17,100 in 2016 to 15,700 in 2017. Yet in one of its first acts of stupidity the South Australian Marshall Liberal government is cutting $5 million from TAFE. This comes on top of more than $3 billion of cuts to TAFE by the Abbott-Turnbull governments, and after the widespread skills training rorts by many private providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">State Liberal and federal coalition governments should stop undermining TAFE by cutting its funding and should support young people who want to take up a trade or a skill here in Australia. It's good to have the nation skilled up for the future, and we should stop relying on importing overseas skilled workers, which has been the trademark of this government ever since coming to office. If there are jobs out there, those jobs should go to Australians who are looking for work. As we know, right now there are about three-quarters of a million people looking for work and more than another million people who would like more hours. For young people the statistics are much worse, with one in three young people either out of work or looking for more hours. We could be doing something for them by simply honouring the budget commitments and allocating the money for projects that would create immediate work. Labor would do that. It would skill up the country by, firstly, scrapping upfront fees for about 100,000 TAFE students and, secondly, committing $100 million to the Building TAFE for the Future Fund. That's what investment in the future is. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Growing up in Mount Gambier I had an innate sense of how important the forest industry was to not only my local community but the nation as a whole. The forest industry contributes a whopping $22.2 billion of economic activity each year to the Australian economy and employs more than 64,000 Australians in the forest, logging and processing sectors. Nationally, the green triangle forms an important part of that industrial effort, but at a local level, to communities in the south-east of South Australia, the industry plays a seminal role in supporting economic activity and jobs. Indeed, it's estimated that the local timber-processing industry in Mount Gambier alone employs more than 1,500 people directly and many more indirectly. This equates to around 10 per cent of the total employment of the town. The economic contribution that this industry made in the 2016-17 financial year in that same community was around $198 million in gross regional product, which in itself represents around 12 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be quite frank, this is not an industry we can afford to ignore nationally or locally. Its importance cannot be overstated, particularly in my home town of Mount Gambier. Nationally, Australia is the seventh most-forested nation, but, sadly, we import much more processed timber than we export. Indeed, Australia has a trade deficit in wood products of more than $2 billion. The processing industry in forestry regions, like those in Barker, enjoys strong prospects for growth, but its growth is currently limited by the lack of access to domestic log supply—not because we don't have access to that resource but because we are exporting that resource in the form of raw logs directly to overseas processors. Last year in the green triangle alone we exported more than 1.7 million cubic tonnes, which equates to close to 50 per cent of our exports nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite and, indeed, some commenters have opined that manufacturing in this country is dead. That's simply untrue. Manufacturing is thriving, as burgeoning Asian markets want more and more of our quality food and fibre. Australian processed timber, like Australian manufactured foods, is in strong demand. Local processors tell me that they are constantly fielding requests for more export product. That would mean more Aussie jobs. We need to develop a strategy to ensure that this industry, one which enjoys bullish prospects, particularly in what looks increasingly like a carbon-constrained future, is not only sustained but afforded the ability to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent budget included $20 million for the National Forest Industries Plan. It's an important step—one that signifies this government's willingness to see and support this industry and its continued success. The National Forest Industries Plan is a sign of this government's support for the jobs that that industry supports and the economic contribution it makes to communities just like those in the south-east of South Australia. But we need to do more to take the handbrake off the timber-processing industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to advocating for the National Forest Industries Plan to include measures to expand our forestry estates, the industry needs urgent measures to increase the access our domestic log processors have to the domestic log supply—in short, Aussie logs for Aussie timber mills. Without this, not only will Australian sawmills be unable to expand and thereby employ more Australians but the jobs of those already in the sector will be in jeopardy. As I advocate in this space, I ask colleagues to remember that in a land as vast as ours, with some of the world's best forestry plantations, we import $2 billion more in wood products than we export. We can do better than this. We need to do better than this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Saturday I was lucky enough to be invited to the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service to commemorate the 20th National Sorry Day. The Victorian Aboriginal Health Service was established over 40 years ago. Its objective was and continues to be to meet the specific health and social needs of Victorian Indigenous communities. But, more than that, it has at its very core community control. Through their own control, the health service know they can support the wellbeing of their community through providing not only vital medical, dental and mental health services but social services as well. Aboriginal community-controlled models of care have been established and in operation in Australia since the 1970s. The Victorian Aboriginal Health Service Limited was one of the earlier community-controlled health services in Australia—the first, of course, being in Redfern. These services were needed because of the poor experiences of the First Nations community members and their treatment by mainstream services that inspired a group of concerned First Nations leaders. With the support of some non-Aboriginal people, they established a culturally safe and appropriate medical service model that would help the needs of First Nations people, and these services are still needed today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The service is managed by Michael Graham, the CEO. Although the original service was set up in Fitzroy, a busy and important satellite has been established in Preston, in my electorate of Batman. It's from that centre that the important Bringing Them Home project is coordinated by the wonderful Daria Atkinson. The program helps with healing. It helps reunite families and provides counselling. The pain, hurt and deep psychological trauma felt by the stolen generations is palpable when you are privileged to be invited into their community. There is no doubt that the effects are intergenerational. There is no doubt that we as non-Aboriginal people have an obligation to listen, to learn, to acknowledge and ultimately to hear from First Nations peoples the way forward.</span>

Martin Luther King III, no less, and his family were special guests, and we were lucky enough to hear Archie Roach and Kutcha Edwards sing healing songs. Archie, himself one of the stolen generations, sang these words:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the star of the night was the wonderful Murray, who proudly stood up and told his story of being only eight when he was taken away from his mother, forcibly removed along with his two sisters and driven thousands of miles away, scared and sad. He was taken to Turana in Melbourne, by no means a place of safety. He was separated from his sisters and treated like a child delinquent. He was thrown into a cell and left there for days. He, as so many young men did, turned to alcohol and self-abuse, but Murray has survived. He told us he married a wonderful woman. He had a family and, like Archie, used music and songs to help heal, one of which he performed along with his granddaughter. He used to have nightmares about that cell and being locked up and losing his family, but he told us the nightmares stopped when he heard Kevin Rudd say 'sorry'. As I left, Daria said to me, 'Did you learn some more, Ged?' I said, 'Oh, yes.' She said, 'Keep coming, keep listening and keep learning,' and I intend to.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  On Monday I attended the funeral of Don Jessop, who was recognised in this chamber on Tuesday. He was the first Liberal member for Grey and was elected as part of Harold Holt's historic 1966 landslide victory. Don served just one term in his place—he lost his seat in 1969—but the reluctant politician, as he called himself, wasn't finished in parliament and was elected to the upper house in a half-Senate election in 1970. He served there until 1987. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don was an Adelaide boy who, after marrying Barbara Maughan in 1949, qualified as an optometrist and forged his career in the country, first in Port Pirie, in Jamestown, then in Broken Hill and finally in Port Augusta. In Port Augusta he set up his own practice and embarked on a lifetime of community service. An inaugural member and vice-president of Apex, he served on the Port Augusta hospital board, he was a Port Augusta city councillor for 10 years and he had a lifelong dedication and commitment to the Methodist Church—later, of course, the Uniting Church of Australia—and another lifelong commitment to choirs. In Port Augusta he became the director of the Choral Society. Later, when Don returned to Adelaide, he continued these strong commitments to the church and choirs through the Adelaide Male Voice Choir. He also had an abiding passion for the Sturt Football Club and at one stage was a vice-president. While in Port Augusta he was instrumental in setting up the RFDS optical service. He was the first flying optician, if you like, the first practitioner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don was always Liberal in spirit and he joined the party in Port Augusta in about 1956. He was prevailed upon in 1966 to run for the seat of Grey and won, against all expectations. Don was the first Liberal member to ever hold Grey, which is a Federation seat. It was a remarkable result, and one that I remember even as a child. 1966 under Harold Holt was a landslide for the Liberal Party. History records though that Australia lost its Prime Minister and the government its leader when Holt was swept away in the rough waters off Portsea. The next election in 1969 saw support recede, and even though the Liberals were returned under John Gorton, Don lost his seat. It was another 23 years before another Liberal was to hold Grey, when, against all the odds again, Barry Wakelin won the seat in 1993. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Don Jessop was far from finished and in 1970 he was successful in the half-Senate election held in November and served there for 17 years until 1987. As is the way sometimes in a party that has a truly democratic preselection system, Don lost his spot in the coming election and was persuaded by his supporters to run as an Independent. He was unsuccessful, even though he won more than 25,000 votes, which was a great testament to his personal popularity. Don said he wasn't always the most popular Liberal, as he crossed the floor from time to time—something I'm pleased to report is still not a sackable offence in the Liberal Party. He expressed public misgivings about the opposition path in denying supply to force the 1975 election, which saw Gough Whitlam replaced by Malcolm Fraser. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember him campaigning for better transport links—in particular, the sealing of the Eyre and Stuart highways and the new standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. The Eyre Highway was completed in 1976 and the Stuart and the railway were both delivered in the eighties, all in Don's time in parliament. It's hard now for many to remember what it was like before these projects and even harder for others to imagine. The trip to Alice Springs was tortuous. It was truly a nation-building project. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was a leading advocate in seeing optical services being added to the then Medibank scheme during the Whitlam years. Using his skill as an optician and a parliamentarian, he worked with the Australian Optometry Association to achieve the listing. Through all this, Don was held in the highest regard by both sides of politics and was considered a true gentleman. I checked with a number of people who worked with Don, and all have spoken of him in the highest terms. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, I was particularly chuffed on the night of my first election when it became clear I had won Grey. I returned to my home town of Kimba and walked into the hotel, where I was greeted by an enthusiastic band of local supporters. I was surprised and humbled to find Don had made the trip up from Adelaide—500 kilometres—to join my predecessor, Barry Wakelin, in welcoming me to the rather exclusive group of just three Liberals in more than 100 years to represent the wonderful electorate of Grey. Rest in peace, Don Jessop. You have served your community, your church, and your nation well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Earlier today I spoke on the condolence motion concerning the passing of former Leader of the Government in the Senate Sir John Carrick. In that contribution I outlined my respect for Sir John, a man who I came to know through his friendship with my mentor and father figure Tom Uren. One of the great privileges of my life was to travel with Tom, in 1987, and meet John Carrick, and other former prisoners of war of the Japanese, at the opening of Hellfire Pass, on the River Kwai, in Thailand. Both Sir John Carrick and Tom Uren were captured in Timor. They both went to Changi prison and they both served on the railway. Both of them can be characterised as having come back to Australia to follow different political paths—one Labor, one Liberal—but determined to serve just one interest: the national interest. Those of us here in 2018 who stand on the shoulders of these giants of the past, who have it a lot easier than the former prisoners of war, must, I believe, recommit ourselves to always serving the national interest. Reflecting on their capacity to rise above the hardships that they endured reminds us of our responsibility to use our time here to make a real difference to real people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always believed that our task here was to deal with the necessities of the immediate whilst also not just anticipating a better future but taking steps to create that better future. That requires long-term thinking and often it requires bipartisanship on issues that go beyond a political term, or even a period of one side of politics in government. We should be proud that we do that quite often. We do it in areas of national security. We do it in areas of public safety. We understand that, in these areas, serving the public interest is our only objective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are so many areas where we can do much better. Take climate change. Prior to 2007 both sides of politics went to the election committed to a market-based mechanism to put a price on carbon. The Howard government had come to that reluctantly, but responded to the Shergold report by accepting the need to do something to drive down emissions throughout the economy. After the change of government the consensus held, with the coalition backing action under Brendan Nelson and Malcolm Turnbull—a consensus that was ripped up at the end of 2009 by both Greens political party opportunism and the rise of Tony Abbott and the climate change sceptics in the coalition. The fact is that if we're going to address climate change we need to address it as a parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same goes for Closing the Gap on Indigenous disadvantage and recognising the First Australians in our constitution. That is going to be possible only if there is bipartisan support across this chamber. The same goes for dealing with challenges of intergenerational inequality. Every economist in the country knows that the taxation arrangements around housing that exist at the moment for investors are one of the issues that are causing housing affordability to just be out of the reach of younger generations. We should be doing something about it. It is the same with the workforce of the future. We know that new technology is having an impact on what the jobs will be in the future. We need to accept the fact that automation is here and change occurs, but how do we shape it in the interests of younger generations to make sure that we don't exclude a whole bunch of people from their working lives?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We often can get it right. We've got it right in areas like the creation of Infrastructure Australia, partisan at the beginning but now supported across the parliament. We got it right in Badgerys Creek Airport, supporting a second airport for Sydney, which took a government decision, but a government decision with opposition support for it to actually happen. I think when we look at the great responsibilities and the great privilege that we have to serve in this place, we should commit ourselves to make a difference, not just for ourselves and our political parties in a partisan way but in the national interest. I think, quite often, this parliament doesn't do that enough. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  It is a great opportunity this evening to stand up for my local community on the northern Gold Coast, especially in terms of the recreational and economic activity driven by boating. It is a big part of working and playing in the northern Gold Coast. It's why I'm delighted to inform the House and report back about the results from the 30th Sanctuary Cove International Boat Show. It's the Southern Hemisphere's premier marine event. The size and scope of this marine event is quite extraordinary. This year there were over 180 boats on water, 275 boats on land and over 300 exhibiters around the world converging at Sanctuary Cove to present a world-class event. It is popular. There were 45,866 visitors walking through the gates over the four days. Each year, this event puts about $150 million into the local economy, adding value to local tourism and boosting Australian and local marine production. It boosts jobs, it boosts business, and it makes a huge difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last three decades that the Sanctuary Cove International Boat Show has been running, over 10,000 exhibiters have shown off their world-class wares and over 1.4 million visitors have been through the gates. In terms of long-term economic benefit, we're talking $3 billion in spend for the region in accommodation, tourism, event spending and investment. In any term, in any way, on any ledger, this is a substantial investment in the local economy. This is a substantial global event, especially in boating terms. It is very popular in terms of B-to-B. Enormous trade occurs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sanctuary Cove International Boat Show is also a member of the International Federation of Boat Show Organisers. Its slogan, if one could call it that, quite rightly is: 'This is where the marine industry does business.' The boat show delivers a comprehensive marine trade display, it showcases the latest innovation in industry and it attracts global and national brands and businesses. In the days prior to the boat show, the Australian Superyacht, Marine Export and Commercial Marine Industry Conference welcomed international speakers and delegates to Sanctuary Cove. Look at where we've come from in 30 years. I'm so proud of this event. It showcases what Australia can do in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a proud boating community on the Gold Coast. Eleven per cent of Queensland's recreational boats are located in my community. We love the water. We are an electorate that hugs the magnificent broadwater. According to the latest data, there are more than 28,000 recreational boats and 700 commercial vessels registered on the Gold Coast. We seriously do love the water. Because of this, I'm very pleased to support the dredging of our waterways, which is commencing shortly, and encourage all governments to ensure that that continues to happen. It's an essential element of maintenance—no different from fixing roads. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also support the government increasing the customs terminal. It was there for 12 months as a test at Southport. I think it has shown the rationale and the reason for the move, and we need to extend that permanently. I also believe there is an opportunity—and I've been reaching out to the Labor Party on this—to deal with the issue of the 10 per cent impost of GST on any superyacht that comes to Australia and wishes to charter. Right now, we face the farcical situation where there are no registered superyachts in Australia. These large boats come to Australia. There is a market for charter, but the current law in this place says that if the $100 million <span style="font-style:italic;">Dragon</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ly</span>, a boat built in Western Australia but owned offshore, comes here and someone wants to charter it, they first of all must pay 10 per cent of the price of the yacht. The yacht owner must pay $10 million to the Commonwealth for the privilege of charter. So surprise, surprise, how many million dollars come in from chartering? Zero. So why don't we apply a modicum of common sense and get rid of this ridiculous rule of 10 per cent GST on charter boats. It is something we can all agree on. Let us go forth and build a great boating industry, not just for the Gold Coast but for the entire country.</span>

It's an opportunity to share sporting success in our region and for presidents to network, get to know one another and discuss future opportunities for our sporting associations, clubs and teams. We heard from the Werribee Basketball Association, which has been named Basketball Victoria's Association of the Year. President, Paul Jones, gave us a terrific five-minute insight into the way our basketball association has grown young people's participation in the game. It was a fabulous evening. We got to see the new development, of course. I have to stop and reflect on the first home game that was held by the Werribee Football Club at the redeveloped ground. After a year on the road, it was great to be back at Chirnside Park. The community atmosphere was absolutely phenomenal. I hope the visiting coaches and teams are enjoying the new facilities as much as our senior coach, John Lamont, and the Werribee Football Club players are enjoying the new facilities. I also hope that the media are enjoying the new facilities at Chirnside Park.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evening for the local sporting champions is also an opportunity to celebrate the grant recipients for the year. These young people have excelled at their chosen sport, competing at national and international championships. This year, we celebrated Kaman Malou, Samuel Clifford, Samuel Reale, Catherine Mashalidis, Catherine Huell, Noah Borg, Divid Palu, Compton Fautimau, Rory Pretty, Tai Pretty, Joshua Gomes, Nicholas Masini, Noah Cooney, Cartier Vasta, Jake Wallis, Aaron Lewer, Guillaume Chianpen, Cooper Hillyer, Ebony Dodemaide, Amy Kurkowski, Xaviour Taufa, Tevita Mapa, Lemau Maiava-Tapusoa, Brendan Wilson, Charli Blackborrow, Katu Little, Jotham Kuku, Sebastian Weickhardt, Daniel Roberts, Jai Copland, Joshua Byrne, Emmet Healey, Haloti Fonua, Sophia Potter and Emmason McCurley.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  Since I was first elected to this place, I have been working hard to deliver for the residents of my electorate of Boothby and to make their daily lives a bit easier. That's why, alongside reducing the cost of living, delivering safe, reliable and efficient roads for my community remains my No. 1 priority. Nothing better represents my commitment to delivering better road infrastructure than the Oaklands Crossing upgrade. As the candidate for Boothby in 2016, I secured $40 million in federal funding to fix this terrible intersection that has been a problem for local residents for four decades. After I was elected, I fought for and secured an additional $55 million for the project so that it could be completed. I'm delighted to inform the House that work will begin on the $174.5 million project this month. This means that locals travelling in the 41,000 vehicles that pass through the crossing every day can soon look forward to a far more efficient commute to work or to get their kids to school. It means local business customers and people using the SA Aquatic and Leisure Centre, which is an Olympic-standard centre, will no longer be stuck at the boom gates for the rail crossing, which can be closed for up to two hours a day in total. Most importantly, it means that parents will be able to pass through what is now considered one of Adelaide's most dangerous level crossings to get their children to school more safely. I want to thank my state colleagues, Marshall Liberal government ministers Corey Wingard MP and David Speirs MP, who worked with me to deliver this for local residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But fixing Oaklands crossing is just the beginning. This weekend, we saw another milestone in the Darlington upgrade project with the installation of new beams for the Sturt Road bridge. By creating a non-stop motorway, between the Southern Expressway and the Tonsley Boulevard, including grade separation of the Main South Road, Ayliffes Road and Shepherds Hill Road intersection, the upgrade will ensure a smoother commute for the 78,000 vehicles that travel Main South Road each and every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also working hard to ensure that local roads in and around my community are of the highest and safest standards through the federal government Roads to Recovery program. We are replacing the road seal and pavement for Clapham residents that will improve things for those who use Anson Avenue and Price Avenue up to Springbank Road. We're upgrading the road for residents in Daw Park and that will improve things for those who use Rockville Avenue and Morgan Avenue, up to Goodwood Road. These local road projects follow on from many others that have already been delivered and completed for my local residents, thanks to the Turnbull Liberal government. I am committed to providing better roads for the residents of Boothby, and I'm pleased to say that the Turnbull Liberal government is delivering this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  It's no wonder that people are disillusioned with politics or feel disempowered. Last week, Minister Fletcher gave my residents six days to respond to an RSVP for an attempted consultation about the Western Sydney airport—six days! Mr Fletcher sent me an email at 7:30 at night and expected me to let 110,000 people in my community know that they had just six days to reply and to get their RSVPs together to go to a community meeting. How on earth did he expect me to advertise to 110,000 people in six days so that they could RSVP and go along to a meeting? If this minister was serious about offering the people of my community genuine consultation on that airport, he would open a meeting to all of the public and invite everybody in and hear everybody's concerns. But we know that's just not what he is interested in because he doesn't want to hear how we all know that this plan is flawed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We constantly hear about how this airport is going to deliver for the people of Western Sydney, how we are going to get all these jobs and this great infrastructure. I can tell you now, Deputy Speaker Hogan, we're not going to get the jobs. Just this week we had Paul O'Sullivan, who is the head of the Western Sydney Airport, come out and say it would be the first digital airport to be ever built. Digital airports—I don't need to tell anyone in here—do not come with jobs for people; they come with jobs for robots and jobs for computers—so, straight up, the argument about the jobs they're creating is flawed. They want us to suck up a 24-hour operational airport, which is completely at odds with what those people who live near the Kingsford Smith Airport have. They want us to suck up 24-hour aircraft noise, and all the additional truck movements that come with a 24-hour operation. They do not want to give us the money for infrastructure. They said they are setting aside $50 million for a 'study' for the rail line, but there's actually no money in this budget to deliver the rail line—the rail line which is going to funnel people from Badgerys Creek to an already crowded, over-burdened and under-pressure T1 line in St Marys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not surprised that people feel like they don't have a voice and that they don't feel they're empowered to make a change. I held consultations of my own over the weekend at my regular 'coffee with a pollie' and, over the course of that day, at least half the people who came to see me had concerns about this airport. This is in exactly the same vein that the New South Wales government have consulted the people of Castlereagh, Llandilo and Cranebrook over the 1951 corridor that, after 67 years, they decided to change overnight. Those residents were consulted by RMS officials landing on their doorstep with white envelopes for them. If this is the way that the Liberals think you deliver consultation to communities, it is absolutely plain wrong. They need to get out from under their hiding places and come out and talk to real people to understand how their decisions are actually affecting real lives, people's livelihoods, their homes and businesses.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I'm a passionate advocate for mental health services for all Australians and am proud to be part of the Turnbull government, which is committed to providing access for all Australians to the services they may need to support their mental health and wellbeing. The Turnbull government are investing over $4.3 billion in mental health services this year, and we are making significant investments in early intervention services and a range of national programs to support Australians in need. Central to this aim is the development and current expansion of the network of headspace services. Headspace provides a youth-friendly environment for young people aged 12 to 25 years to access support for mental health and other concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Chisholm embraces the Eastern Melbourne Public Health Network region and receives annual funding of $2.9 million for the commissioning of headspace services. The public health network currently commissions headspace services in south-eastern Melbourne, with young people being able to access headspace services at various locations. The headspace network of services provides holistic care for young people aged between 12 and 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the Eastern Melbourne Public Health Network commissions the Youth Engagement Treatment Team Initiative, which provides extra staff to support more young people with or at risk of severe and enduring mental illness. And the public health network is currently working with local service providers and the community to establish a youth health hub which provides a central point of contact for young people to access mental health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For young people across Chisholm and indeed across Australia, eheadspace is also available. Eheadspace provides free, confidential and anonymous telephone and web based services to young people aged 12 to 25 years with or at risk of developing mild to moderate mental illness. From feedback I've received, eheadspace is often the preferred form of access for confidential counselling, and eheadspace can be contacted by telephone on 1800650890, which is a free call, or via the internet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, a key budget initiative is $338.1 million in new mental health funding where there is a focus on suicide prevention. An additional one million people will receive diagnosis, treatment and recovery through a new Million Minds Mission in mental health research, with funding of $125 million over the next decade. There is also $110 million additional investment in child and youth mental health services, with a focus on providing mental health services to children within the school setting, which is so important. Finally, in addition, the Turnbull government recently announced that it would provide $33.8 million to Lifeline to significantly boost their telephone crisis service, helping them to support hundreds and thousands of Australians in need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Today I've written again to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, asking for another investigation into the debt notices being sent to thousands of unsuspecting Australians as part of the federal government's social welfare debt recovery program. I've done this because I've been approached by a whistleblower, one with a good understanding of the debt recovery process, who has provided me with remarkable examples of some of the ongoing flaws in the program. This leaves me in no doubt whatsoever that the program is indeed deeply flawed and deeply unfair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, debts are regularly duplicated and even triplicated simply because the same employer has been entered into the Centrelink system differently. For instance, 'McDonald's' or 'McDonald's family restaurant' might variously have been entered for the same worker at the same McDonald's outlet. The problem is that this sort of error goes unrectified because there's no mechanism for cross-checking other than manually, and that's only ever undertaken on an irregular basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This whistleblower has also told me that people who provide pay slips to substantiate income are repaying more to Centrelink than those who provide bank statements, simply because net income on bank statements is not grossed up. This can result in hundreds of dollars difference in debt repayments. This practice is made even worse by the fact that Centrelink asks for pay slips but accepts bank statements, the result being that those able to do Centrelink's bidding end up in effect penalised.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, there's the lack of transparency and communication about how debts are calculated. I provided the Ombudsman with an example of a debt notice given to one of my constituents, in order to illustrate the problem. In this case, the debt from 2011 to 2016 is nearly $16,000, and Centrelink demanded full payment within about three weeks after the debt notice was received. I don't know about you, Deputy Speaker, but if I received an alleged bill for nearly $16,000 I'd want to know a heck of a lot about it, like how it was calculated, because there's no way a person can realistically identify problems with a debt in the absence of any information or evidence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had countless people in my office literally sobbing because of this Centrelink robo-debt nonsense, or so stressed they can hardly breathe, or so frustrated because they believe they've done the right thing and are struggling to prove their innocence but can't get a straight answer from Centrelink about how the debt was calculated. The government must stop this program and sort it out. And it must do so now, because there's simply no so-called saving when in reality it's costing the community so very, very much.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  On Monday, 28 May the nation of Azerbaijan celebrated its 100th anniversary. The nation came about 100 years ago, in 1918, the first secular parliamentary democracy among all Muslim-majority nations. Unfortunately their democracy was very short lived because in April 1920 the Soviets invaded—and they stayed there for over 70 years. Our nation had the benefit of 100 years of colonial rule, of British settlement, to develop our institutions. Azerbaijan had 70 years of the corrupting influence of the Soviets. It should be noted that Azerbaijan is one of the few Muslim-majority nations to have formal relations with Israel. Israel's Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, visited Azerbaijan in 2016. In the centre of Azerbaijan's capital city, Baku, is a statue of a female casting off her veil. Although Azerbaijan is a fully Muslim country, they give full rights to women. In fact, the headscarf and the veil are banned from their schools. They try to ensure they're seen as a secular nation rather than a nation of any one particular religion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to Azerbaijan and I was impressed by the economic development of the nation and the city of Baku. We hope that this nation, situated between Iran to the south and Russia to the north, will develop strong democratic systems and continue to develop its economy in a strong way. If we look at the history of the world, we have the example of Singapore. Singapore became strong economically and democratically, and that spread to the other nations around it. That should be the world's wish for the nation of Azerbaijan: to influence the region, to be stronger economically and to be stronger democratically.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to touch on the dispute with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh area. I understand the concerns of the Armenian population here in Australia. I encourage all parties to, rather than demonising each other, have open dialogue to discuss the issues so that, hopefully, the dispute can be resolved along with the United Nations conventions.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I rise to speak out regarding the alarming issue of dowry, and dowry related abuse, and the violence affecting women and families across Australia. The parliament and the government must take this seriously. Some consideration of my request was given last year by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, but their report just kicked the can down the road to the family law inquiry. This isn't good enough. I now call for a dedicated inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee to shine real light on these issues and examine what action is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Payment of dowry is a cultural practice that still happens in many countries in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It's mainly paid by a bride's family to the groom and his family—gold, jewellery, cash and sometimes property. It has cultural and probably religious origins. It was outlawed in India in 1961, yet Australia has still failed to outlaw dowry abuse. Shocking stories have been aired in the media, including an excellent piece in 2017 by Debra Jopson as part of the ABC's investigation into the links between religion and family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the practice of dowry is completely inappropriate in modern Australia. Dowry perpetuates a culture of ownership of women, which runs against the cause of equality. Women are not property; cultural or religious practices that suggest so are not welcome in Australia. I think it's important that we state these truths loudly, clearly and without qualification. We should not be afraid of honest, respectful debate in communities to confront the deeply patriarchal cultures of male entitlement and deal with this problem. This is not a benign, esoteric issue. Dowry extortion has been recognised as a direct cause of family violence and horrific murders and suicides. Alarming growth in reports has been seen in certain communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again the Victorian Labor government has led the way. I congratulate them on their commitment to implement the 2016 recommendation of the Royal Commission into Family Violence to expand statutory examples of family violence to include forced marriage and dowry-related abuse. You cannot bar gifts, of course, but you can stop grooms and families from demanding dowry, or bride price, as it's called, before or, often, after marriages, when the family then get their hooks into a vulnerable new bride. Women and families who don't comply with these dowry demands face abuse and abandonment by husbands and deportation if on temporary visas and loss of Medicare and access to services. Outlawing dowry is an important normative position, but there are other areas to explore, including the Marriage Act, slavery laws, migration, financial dispute provisions and family violence responses by Commonwealth and state agencies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first spoke publicly in the media last year about dowry abuse, I got emails and calls from men telling me it's not a problem and bagging the brave women who were speaking out. I congratulate my friend Dr Manjula O'Connor for her tireless work campaigning for years against dowry through the Australasian Centre for Human Rights and Health. I repeat my call for a dedicated Senate inquiry this year, not another joint House committee controlled by government muppets.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  I am of the belief that every member of parliament here, including the crossbenchers, has a real concern about the increasing cost of electricity and the effect that that is having across our communities. Last financial year we had over 100,000 homes in this nation that couldn't afford to pay their electricity bills and were so far behind they had their electricity cut off. A hundred thousand homes in the nation had their electricity cut off. And one issue where I think we can help relieve electricity bills is the cost of the subsidies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year the direct cost of the subsidies paid to renewable energy providers will be $3.6 billion. That is the equivalent of $150 for every man, woman and child in the country or $600 for the average family of four. It is direct cost bang on top of their cost of living. Some of those subsidies, which I recently discovered, were actually extended as a gift by the former Prime Minister Mr Rudd. The previous Liberal government had set up a renewable energy scheme that went from about the year 2001 to the year 2010 and where the renewable energy target was set to escalate up to 9,500 gigawatt-hours. What happened? That scheme was meant to carry on where those people who made that investment were able to get the renewable energy certificates and sell them on the market as was required up to the year 2020. That is how those people made that investment. But with a stroke of a pen, with one addition in the bill introduced by the former Labor government, they extended those subsidies to roll out for another decade. It is in fact handing billions of dollars away freely to people that have made these investments over and above the generous subsidies they have received. This year those companies that made that investment prior to 2010 will receive $800 million, close to $1 billion, extra over what they are getting for the electricity, which is already at record level prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unconscionable to continue that scheme on for the next decade and to expect consumers to pay those people additional subsidies over and above what was contemplated at the time they made that investment. That would reduce electricity bills for consumers in this nation by close to $800 million to $1 billion from the year 2020 if we went back to the original intent. It is unfair that consumers should pay this extra cost, and I call on members of the opposition to sit down so we can try to this in a bipartisan manner.</span>

Darwin is Donghai Airlines' third international port, with direct flights into Thailand and Vietnam having been initiated a few months ago. Darwin, of course, has an advantage over Sydney and Melbourne for these Chinese coming from Shenzhen—a 5½ hour flight and they're in the Top End of Australia. Compare that to my flights to get down here from Darwin to our national capital. I can be on a plane and waiting in transit for anywhere up to eight hours. Donghai Airlines has many internal Chinese links and Shenzen has many international links, so it can be a real hub not only for people from around Australia to visit the Top End; you can then bounce with Donghai Airlines into China to explore China.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I held a tourism ideas fest, where we had industry coming together with entrepreneurs and innovators to discuss the ways that we can make sure that what we're doing has some appeal to those Chinese tourists, because we want them to come back. I was pleased to see that the Australia China Business Council in Darwin are holding a One Belt, One Road conference on 10 and 11 July. Darwin, as the capital of northern Australia, is our closest city to China, and will link into China's huge trade and economic development push into Europe and South Asia. It's a very exciting time, and I commend Daryl Guppy and his team for their initiatives.</span>

It was a fantastic afternoon with a really high-quality presentation that did the club proud and showcased the talents and skills of the little athletes involved at the club. There was a very professional audio-visual presentation, which highlighted each of the kids who were being acknowledged on the day. As I said, it was a very, very high-quality professional presentation. I presented the Banks outstanding sporting achievement awards to some younger athletes involved at the centre. A great afternoon was had by all. I'd like to thank the club president, Steve Jones; vice-president, Greg Facer; championships officer, Steve Sorojevic; publicity officer, Debra Topalidis; secretary, Leanne McDonald; and all of the other many volunteers involved at Bankstown Sports Little Athletics Centre for everything that they do for kids in our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 May, I attended the meeting of the Mortdale Probus club. We have a very strong Probus community in the Banks electorate, with many Probus clubs. Probus clubs provide a great environment for friendship, for activities and for putting back into the community. The first Probus club in Australia was established some 40 years ago. Probus really is one of the linchpins of the local community in the Banks electorate. Mortdale is particularly active and participates in a wide range of different activities, such as bushwalks, fishing, craft, various lunches and other outings. Thanks to the president, Janice Owen, and everyone who was there on the day for their hospitality. I look forward to visiting the club in the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 24 April, I caught up with Ted Palumberri, the president of Renown United Rugby League Club, down at Renown Park in Mortdale. Renown is one of the largest rugby league clubs in the St George area, with more than 10 junior teams. When I was at Renown Ted showed me the plans for the new clubhouse. The old clubhouse has given loyal service over many decades but really does need to be replaced, and it's great to see that will be occurring. Renown is a really important site, not just for rugby league but also for soccer and other sports in our community. One of the issues at Renown Park is that the lighting needs to be improved, and that's something I will continue to work on. Thanks to Renown Rugby League.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Thursday, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian </span>reported that Assistant Secretary Narelle Clegg of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources broke down during a Senate estimates hearing while describing the conditions on live sheep export ships that led to the death of 2,400 sheep on one of those voyages. Many have seen the footage of the live sheep export ships that leave Fremantle on their way to the Middle East, and there is outrage in the Australian community. I don't think I have to explain that to any member of this parliament. All of us have received hundreds, indeed thousands, of genuine emails from local people who are outraged at this brutality. According to Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, close to two million sheep are put on these ships from Australian ports every year. The live sheep export industry, according to the MLA, is worth $249 million. By comparison, in 2016, according to the MLA, the total export of red meat was $12.1 billion. This puts the export of live sheep at around two per cent of the bigger red-meat export market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, last week we saw the impact of the cruelty on a senior department official months after the footage was seen. Last year, Labor's agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, put out a plan about what Labor would be doing. He spoke very eloquently and passionately at a public forum that we held. It's not often that we have the agriculture spokesman speak in an inner city electorate, but he was very good at it. We were putting the deep ethical concerns I've had about animal welfare for a long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources seem to have backed the industry over public concern and have vowed to continue the live export of sheep, despite the meat and livestock association's being unable to offer any guarantee that the type of cruelty witnessed will not occur again. By contrast, Labor has made a commitment to phase out the live export of sheep. Both the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, and the agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, have committed to immediately ceasing the live export of sheep during the coming Middle Eastern summer and phasing it out over five years. Joel Fitzgibbon discussed on radio FIVEAA how the Turnbull government is not only refusing to act but actually injuring efforts to investigate industry failings, after the Western Australian regulator was forced to make an FOI request to obtain information from the Commonwealth regulator. In comparing Minister Littleproud's words and actions, Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, said that Mr Littleproud says he is 'going to hunt down the bad guys and put them in jail' et cetera. That's Mr Littleproud's rhetoric. But now, when the Western Australian government is attempting to pursue rogue operators, the Commonwealth is not interested in lending it any assistance. There is a clear difference: Labor plans to act and the Turnbull government's plan thus far is to evade responsibilities as far as this disgraceful cruelty on live sheep export ships is concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All politics are local. People expect action from MPs even if they are not in areas of federal responsibility. They expect us to support state governments like the Victorian government, who were acting on issues of housing affordability with vacant properties. According to the 2016 census, 13.7 per cent of homes in Melbourne Ports are unoccupied, which is much higher than the national average of 11.2. It's clear that Labor's state plan to work on a vacant property tax would help free up supply. It's clear we have an affordability issue hitting younger people all around the country. I know I have extensively Facebooked and written people, and I've had a direct mail campaign and gotten very positive feedback to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to draw attention to the difference between this government's plans and the opposition's plans on negative gearing. Many people have attacked the Leader of the Opposition in a very unfair way over the years, but no-one can say he lacks policy courage. It was widely considered that negative gearing was an untouchable policy area, but now it's time for a more level field for first home buyers. It's clear that the Turnbull government doesn't understand the depth of the problem or the potential role of our federal tax system in levelling the playing field. Treasurer Morrison decided to criticise the states instead. At the Urban Development Institute of Australia in Sydney in 2016 he boiled the housing affordability crisis down to a supply issue, and he's since has said very little. This is despite the analysis from the Australian National University last year that we have an undersupply of 164,000 dwellings. Australia's banking regulator, APRA, are applying restrictions to investor financing in a bid to level the playing field, obviously due to government inaction on the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a reasonable and, indeed, sensible approach to this matter. We want to reform our federal tax system, not in a bid to reduce investment in the housing market but in a bid to make the current level of investment work better, and to help increase supply by allowing negative gearing on new homes only. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that 93 per cent of new investment loans go to people purchasing existing housing stocks. This means that the vast bulk of investment in the housing market does not increase supply or boost jobs; all it does is increase demand and the price of existing homes, allowing investors to use tax subsidies to outbid owner-occupiers and first home buyers for existing properties, locking young people out of the housing market. There is a serious policy difference between the two parties on this issue, which affects a fundamental issue of equity in our society, particularly as far as it affects younger people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to the area of education. Labor obviously supports funding of the government school sector and would see that the Gonski projections and plans would be carried out so that the government school sector would continue to flourish in a way that I would say exceeds the current government. I want to particularly focus on data that I have from the Parliamentary Budget Office and the National Catholic Education Commission. Remember, under a Labor government, Catholic schools would receive an extra $250 million in funding compared to under this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Catholic schools claim they have been unfairly targeted by the Gonski 2.0 school funding policy. Funding for over 600 Catholic systemic schools—over one-third of the Catholic system—has been cut under the Turnbull government, largely as a result of the removal of systemic funding arrangements. The Catholic Education Commission in Victoria claims these cuts will amount to an average of nearly $600,000 per school or just under $2,000 per student. Catholic schools across the country are forced to increase their fees as a result. I saw that some in regional New South Wales were forced to do that. The local Catholic schools are complaining very bitterly about it. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> reported in October 2017:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The National Catholic Education Commission has warned that fee rises are being considered for 766,000 students under changes also questioned by Lutheran Education and the Victorian Ecumenical System of Schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The principal of Emmaus College in East Melbourne said that his Catholic school stood to lose $982,000, or $773 per student in next year's funding and would have to decide whether to increase school fees or cut programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The working poor, some of whom attend the Catholic school system, are the people who are particularly going to be under severe financial strain as a result of this. Catholic Education Victoria states its aim:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Catholic education aspires to provide a low-fee, modest, faith-based, inclusive schooling option for all families who seek one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cuts in federal funding put the low-fee model at risk. Labor is committed to ensuring, just as with the government school system, the sustainability of the Catholic education model without the need to push up fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gonski 2.0 limited the Catholic education system's autonomy to distribute funds according to its own assessment of local school needs, and I can tell you they are very different according to each school. I know some of my local parish schools such as St Aloysius, St Joe's and St Columbus are very worried about these changes and the effect of fees on their parents. They take people from large families. They take the families of recent refugees and they make no bones about being inclusive in taking everyone even though they are a fee-paying system. They often have people in apparently wealthy postcodes like Elwood or Caulfield who are lower down the socioeconomic ladder. So it's very difficult imposing hard and fast models on parochial schools which are inclusive and take everyone and not necessarily the wealthiest people from that suburb.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been reports claiming that the government is considering giving the Catholic sector an additional $1 billion to make up for the inequities in the socioeconomic status system that I just described and which was introduced by Minister Birmingham. However, this admission of a failed funding model has not been backed up by anything in the 2018-19 budge, and as of yet the government has failed to release its own review of its funding methodology and its effect on these poorer parish schools. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Weekend Australian</span> in May 2018, the Catholic Church believes it needs $3 billion for its schools over the next decade to make up for these inequities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to end on something a bit mischievous. Recently the ABC has been complaining about funding cuts. I was very aggrieved at the cancellation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>, the once highly valued program which would often set out the agenda for the following day's news. In my view, the cut backs to <span style="font-style:italic;">PM</span> to half an hour, the cut of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> and some changes to Melbourne morning radio and not the kind of changes that serious listeners to the ABC want. The ABC announced in February that <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>'s audience was steadily declining. In 2017 it had an average audience of about 185,000, whereas the ABC news channel had a figure of was 239,000 in 2014-15. The program's demise came after frequent changing of presenters and changing formats. When it was in its prime it had such presenters such as Kerry O'Brien and Maxine McKew, each of whom held the role for six or more years. Between 2007 and 2017 the show went through four hosts, and this is likely to have put off viewers. With few exceptions—perhaps <span style="font-style:italic;">7.30</span>—the public is left with pay TV as a main option for political discussion. This is failing on the part of the national broadcaster, whose role is to provide balanced and unbiased journalistic debate on serious issues of current affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In February the ABC stated in its annual public hearing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The program's resources have been better utilised by being reinvested into the ABC Investigations team, the Specialist Reporting Team, and new programs Matter of Fact, National Wrap and a 10.30pm news bulletin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen as a <span style="font-style:italic;">Matter of Fact</span> with Stan Grant. That's a valuable addition. That's actually making up for some of the absence of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>. But I must say that I don't understand why so many ABC current affairs programs had to be liquidated in order to provide money for the so-called ABC investigations unit, headed by the empire-building John Lyons and his offsider, with whom he has decided political views, Sophie McNeill, whom he brought back from the Middle East. I don't understand why we're all suffering from a lack of current affairs in order that one faction of the ABC should be funded more. The public benefit was in an hour-long <span style="font-style:italic;">PM</span> program and a <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span> program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad the new chairman of the ABC and its new executive director, Michelle Guthrie, are being more sensitive in issuing apologies. There was an apology issued to the ECAJ for a disgracefully bigoted broadcast that was broadcast on Radio National. I commend the ABC for doing that. But I can't understand their priorities as far as current affairs are concerned. A public face, with more <span style="font-style:italic;">PM</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and more <span style="font-style:italic;">Lateline</span>, is the way I would go, with fewer invisible investigations units.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E3L" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORRISON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  Last Saturday, I had the honour and the privilege to attend with the Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister John Howard and his wife, Janette, the funeral for Sir John Carrick KCMG AC. Sir John survived his wife, Angela, by about four months. He lived to the age of 99. He was one of the finest of his generation. I have not seen a finer generation of Australians. It was a generation that served in the Second World War, a generation that did so much to build the country, and Sir John was a giant amongst those who did all of these things. Sir John's service reminded us all of the impression that one individual can make, and I speak of it as an impression because it is something that lasts. He made an impression on all of those he came in contact with, a lasting one, a firm one and a firming one, a positive one, an encouraging one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I knew Sir John because I served as the party director in New South Wales for many years and it was my habit then to go and sit in his apartment in Burwood and spend time with Sir John, seek his counsel and his advice. We would sit and talk about many things over hours and I was always so incredibly impressed about not only his command of detail and knowledge but just the graceful wisdom that he was able to impart. There was always a generosity of spirit. There was always a kindness behind every sentiment that he expressed. He was a truly remarkable person, and I was very honoured to have known him in the way that I did. So many others knew him far better but I do consider myself privileged to have had the opportunity to have known him in the way I did. So he did leave an impression. He was not just one of, I would say, the founding fathers of the Liberal Party, having served first as a research assistant and then as the general-secretary of the party of New South Wales for 22 years—a record that I am quite sure no-one would seek to emulate because, in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party, there is no more significant figure other than of course, John Howard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a founding father of the party, he brought the principles, pragmatism and intellectual values and capacity he had to this task, which provided our party with the right framework, the right basis and the right platform to become what it is today. We owe so much to, not just Sir John, but Bob Cotton and of course Robert Menzies and that whole generation of Liberals at that time, who set about creating the party that has become the most successful political organisation in Australia's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Sir John's life before he entered politics was quite different. He served as a young man in Sparrow Force in Indonesia where he was captured and he then went on to Changi, the Thai-Burma railway, Hell Fire Pass. As an officer there, he had special responsibilities to lead his men in the darkest of hours. As the Prime Minister reminded us in the House, they had a practice that no-one died alone and, while they were far from home, their fellow prisoners of war would hold each other as they passed on. Indeed, as Sir John passed on, he was held by his daughters, as the Prime Minister reminded us. This went on for some time. They slept through the night on the floor or in the room—I am assuming—and they stayed there and were with him until the very end. He passed on in the same way that his comrades when he served as a PoW also passed on—in the arms of the people that loved him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is what he said at the end of their time which was recalled at the funeral on the weekend that I found so much of the character of Sir John Carrick and it was this: As they were going to be going home, told the PoWs to put all of this behind them—all of its horror, all of its awfulness, all of its deprivations, all of its pain. He said, 'You are young men. Go back and live your lives in a positive way.' The capacity to say that after having experienced what none of us today can imagine speaks to a quality of a person that runs very, very deep and that we were very blessed to have amongst us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John went on to be married to Angela for 67 years. To hear his grandchildren speak at the funeral was just tremendous. Noah, Joel and Ben Campbell, and Matthew Woods and Genevieve Woods paid tribute to their 'Pa' with the hair flopping over the front of his face in the pool and his hands clapping together like an alligator as he chased them around the pool. They didn't speak of the war hero or the political titan of the Liberal Party. They spoke of Pa and the love and the joy that he brought to their lives as a family and as a member of this place. It was a great reminder that you can serve here and you can have a wonderful family, provided you continue to commit to it and see it as the most important thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John is just an incredibly great reminder, and this is why I talk of the impression that he potentially put on all of us, but particularly those who met him. He was able to achieve a balance in life. Yes, he was away for long stretches and periods of time from his family, but to hear them speak of him and the investment that he made in them—and the songs from the 'song machine' he would often to sing to his grandchildren in the evening when he was looking after them later in life—showed he was able to walk between the great corridors of power, the battlefields of wartime and the simpleness of home and do it all so effortlessly—an extraordinary thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the sad part of all of this is not that Sir John has passed on—we celebrated a man of great faith that afternoon and he is with his lord now—it was the reminder of the 40,000 Australians who didn't come home from the Second World War and the loss to Australia of all the John Carricks that never came home and were never able to make the contribution that Sir John and so many of his generation did. That was the tragedy when I reflected on Sir John's passing. It reminded us of those who didn't come home and what they would have otherwise been able to contribute to our country and, indeed, the 60,000-odd in the First World War and those who have fallen in conflicts since. That is the great loss of war, not just the loss of life, but the loss of contribution that was able to be made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, with Sir John, his contribution—it's hard to find a peer. We can only hope to try and serve to the same standard with the same integrity that he served as a father, as a husband, as a member of the Senate, as a leader in politics, as a lieutenant in command, and serving with fellow prisoners of war. We can only hope that we can approach his standard. We also can reflect on the loss of so many others who could have served in the same way, but, sadly, did not come home. His time as a senator, his time as a Leader of the Government in the Senate, his time as a minister in resources and education—he was particularly passionate about education. He would often tell me those stories. We would be sitting in his apartment, talking about how to negotiate coalition agreements or things like this—which he had great wisdom about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">A government member:</span>  And success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E3L" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr MORRISON:</span>
                  </a>  And success, true. Then he would change topic and he would be talking about the OPEC oil crisis and the people that he met in the Middle East and how he dealt with those issues. He would often return to his most favourite topic—early childhood education and the duty we owe to those in their early years. His passion for issues of intellectual curiosity, as much as anything else, stayed with him right until the end. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we left the church on Saturday at the end, 99 bells were struck from the church. For several minutes there, as we listened to them, we had the opportunity to reflect on one of the greatest Australians I've ever known. I hope to meet many more like him, and I hope all of us can seek to aspire to his standard. Thank you, Sir John. You've left an incredible impression.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Treasurer and other members in paying tribute to a great Australian indeed, Sir John Leslie Carrick. John Carrick was a father, a husband, a veteran, a senator and a champion of the causes to which he devoted his life. He passed away on 18 May aged 99 years, just shortly after his beloved wife, Lady Angela, who died in February of this year. They had three daughters, Diane, Jane and Fiona. I spoke to Jane last week. Jane is married to a former member, Bob Woods. I got to know Sir John through my relationship with my mentor and father figure Tom Uren, who of course served with Sir John.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He grew up the fourth of six children in Sydney, in Woollahra. He moved to Randwick and eventually Bondi. He studied at Sydney Technical High School. He delivered gas bills for AGL while studying economics at the University of Sydney. He lived in a time, though, that was turbulent, and he enlisted in the AIF in December 1940.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was posted to the 18th Anti-Tank Battery, and his unit was deployed to West Timor as part of Sparrow Force in December 1941, with orders to deny the island to the enemy. There, two months later, he was captured, along with some extraordinary Australians—Tom Uren and 'Bluey' Rutherford. These were giants of Australian history. Lieutenant Carrick was captured, together with other survivors, and was shipped to Java in July 1942. They then moved to Singapore's Changi camp and worked on the railway—as they put it, quite that simply—at the infamous Hellfire Pass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great opportunities I've had in my life was to visit Hellfire Pass for the opening in 1987. Many of the veterans, of course, since then have passed away. Sir 'Weary' Dunlop was there, along with Sir John Carrick, Tom Uren and other veterans. I saw the extraordinary emotion of these men who went through hell. When you see Hellfire Pass—and I encourage Australians to visit there—you literally see the rock that they cut through, often with no real tools being offered, suffering from malaria, suffering from starvation. The mistreatment that occurred to the prisoners of war would have, I think, understandably broken any human being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was remarkable about these men was that they were so stoic about their experience. They had a sense of solidarity and looked after each other at that time. Coming together more than 40 years after the war had ended, they had—my understanding is that it was—the largest gathering of these men that happened in that period in one place. These were tough guys but they cried, they talked, they drank and celebrated life and survival. They were determined to take that experience and cherish life and make the most of it for themselves, their families and their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that visit, Sir John Carrick wanted to go down the River Kwai. We went down on a longboat. I sat next to him for about four hours there and back—and the Treasurer has just spoken about the long chats. He had a chat with me. I was a very young man. I was in my early 20s. We had a chat about our different philosophies. He was absolutely committed to the Liberal Party. He was a giant of the Liberal Party. The three giants of the Liberal Party have been Bob Menzies, Sir John Carrick and John Howard. They are the big three in history. There he was, with a young democratic socialist. It was my first overseas trip; I had never been anywhere. I was overwhelmed by this experience. Tom Uren, in order to develop my life skills I guess, had taken me on this trip. Sir John was very generous in talking about the times that he had had. But Tom Uren only ever spoke to me about his war experiences during that trip; it was the only time in his life. And I would have spoken to Tom at least once a fortnight, for decades. Sir John talked about, in a personal way, his experiences. He told me some things that perhaps he had not told other people. And I certainly kept that confidence. I regarded it as a great honour. He shared his experiences in order to educate me. He talked about his involvement in the Liberal Party, about his philosophy and about his commitment to early childhood education. He was a great thinker. He was an intellectual. I was speaking with Jane last week, and she was aware that we had corresponded over the years. John was always very generous in his comments. The last time I saw him was at To Uren's funeral service at Sydney Town Hall. Despite his ill health, he was determined to be there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One remarkable thing about all of these people—and one would hope that we would have their character to respond in a similar way—was that they bore the Japanese people no ill will at all. Indeed, Sir John Carrick refused to give testimony to any war crimes tribunal because he regarded that as being about the past and that it was the structures and systems of fascism that had created the problem, not the people; it was the political structures. People had different ways of responding to that. Tom Uren was a collectivist. For his whole life, he believed in the importance of the collective—from that experience of the way the Australian prisoners of war share everything. In his first speech and subsequently, he spoke about the fit looking after the sick, and those who had the most giving it to those who needed it. The officers did not have the same hierarchy as occurred under the British system, which was across the other side of the river. Indeed, in terms of survival rates, the Australians did much better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Sir John Carrick, it was the importance of the individual and liberty. He had a very coherent position, and, in spite of the fact that on the surface it was very different to Tom's, there was a great deal of consistency, essentially, about both of them; a consistency that was all about the Australian national interest. Sir John Carrick said it was systems, not people, that caused the sorts of atrocities that happened during that. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… although I had seen many atrocities, I saw the evil compulsion of the system on the individual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's not people who create the savagery, but the systems of government … Human nature depends upon the political and social environment in which it finds itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought that the obituary by Troy Bramston in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> was very good. He interviewed Sir John Carrick last year. In that interview, Sir John said, 'Good god, I've seen the most horrible things. I saw human beings in terror.' There, he was talking about the Japanese, that the whole structure of that system was one of terror. Today, when terror has a different form—in particular, the rise of Islamic terrorism, a form of fascism that seeks to impose its views on others in the most horrific way; that discards humanity and human rights—that challenge remains for us in a different way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John came back to Australia, enrolled in a law course at the University of Sydney and took a job as a research officer in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. Two years later, he became the general secretary of the New South Wales division, a position he held until 1971. It is remarkable that someone who began as general secretary in the 1940s was still the general secretary in the 1970s. I find that quite extraordinary. Six years in a party office was six years too many for myself, as far as I'm concerned. He went on to become the Minister for Housing and Construction, Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Minister for Education, Minister for National Development and Energy and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Federal Affairs. He was appointed the Leader of the Senate in August 1978, and he retired from the Senate in June of 1987.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was interesting; there were a number of veterans who had at that time a solidarity across the chamber. Think about the turmoil of that time—the election of the Whitlam government, the dismissal in 1975, the period of the Fraser government and then the election of the Hawke government. There were a whole lot of people during that era that served in this place who, compared with our life experiences, we are so much more fortunate than. We literally stand on their shoulders as the result of their sacrifice, and we should always remember that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008, Sir John was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… distinguished service in the area of educational reform in Australia, particularly through the advancement of early childhood education and to the development and support of new initiatives in the tertiary sector …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He continued to be an active servant of the community post politics, serving on boards and advisory committees, serving, no doubt, as a mentor to people like the Treasurer and many others in the Liberal Party, and being prepared to give advice to people such as myself whilst being totally loyal to his party. There's no question that there was no more passionate supporter of the Liberal Party than Sir John Carrick. He also understood, and it's something we as parliamentarians should always understand as well, that above all we in this place have one interest to serve, and that is the national interest. Sir John Carrick is someone whose entire life was about serving the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay tribute to him today, and I express my sincere condolences to his family, to his friends and to his comrades who he served with. There are very few of these veterans left now, but we are very humbled, I think, in their presence, because what they did for the country should never ever be forgotten. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="203092" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZIMMERMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I rise to support the condolence motion that was moved in the chamber by the Prime Minister and that has been so eloquently supported by the Leader of the Opposition and those that have spoken since. I do so to honour a remarkable Australian and one of the finest servants of the Liberal Party and our ideals, Sir John Carrick. I want to start by thanking the Prime Minister for what I thought was an incredible speech that he gave in the House of Representatives in honour of Sir John's life. I suspect in part that reflects the fact that the Prime Minister's own father-in-law, Tom Hughes, was one of the beneficiaries of Sir John's support and patronage in his own political career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fair to say and reflect on the fact—and no hyperbole—that Sir John is without peer in terms of shaping the success of the Liberal Party in New South Wales and also, I'd argue, nationally. He was our general secretary from 1948 until 1971. He actually began his career with the Liberal Party two years earlier, in 1946, when he accepted what was a temporary job following his return from the horrors of World War II. It was, however, to become a lifetime career, both as a member of the staff of our secretariat and then as a senator in the other place. It was a role that he took, as I mentioned, not long after he'd come back from South-East Asia, where he had served Australia in Sparrow Force but was subsequently to become a prisoner of war in some of those horrific circumstances that have been so well documented. Many Australians reacted differently to that experience, but Sir John was, like many of his peers, one who came back to Australia with an absolute determination to create a more peaceful and more successful world, a world in which the horrors that he had experienced himself would not be ones that future generations would have to endure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of those returned servicemen like himself were to go on to serve in state and federal politics. It's fair to say that the ranks of the Liberal Party in parliament at the time bore many of those returned servicemen, as did of course the Labor Party as well—Tom Uren typifies the service of many returned servicemen to that side of politics. I think it's in fact a fair observation to say that the early Liberal Party of Menzies was founded on the influence of two groups: firstly, those many returned servicemen who were determined to commit their lives to public service and also those women's organisations that Menzies recruited so successfully to join the new party, and which really became its backbone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John was a formidable general secretary of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. He served in that role for some incredible 23 years. In fact, it was often joked—I have no idea whether it was true—when he was encouraged to move to the Senate it was because the Liberal Party couldn't afford the superannuation he'd racked up at that time. I joined the Liberal Party at the time that Sir John was finishing his public career in the Senate, in the late 1980s, but even as a teenage Young Liberal, the legacy of Sir John Carrick was recognised and lauded across the party. My own understanding of Sir John Carrick's role was aided by the fact that one of my first jobs was working for the late John Booth, the then state member for Wakehurst. John, alongside people like Terry Metherell, had been a member of Sir John Carrick's staff while he was a senator for New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John had, at that time and throughout his career, a reputation as one of the Liberal Party's greatest political operators. He was courtly, but he was also tough, and I want to note that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bulletin</span> described him as 'the grey eminence of Ash Street', Ash street being our then headquarters, but also as the 'smiler with a knife'. Like no other estate director, as we now call it, he shaped the affairs of the division, and his hand was in many preselections. In fact, there was a term used to describe his time as general secretary, and that was head office factionalism. He had little truck for the emergence of other factions in the Liberal Party. In fact, most notably, in the late 19060s he put an end to the ambitions of the now notorious Lyenko Urbanchich in Warringah because he was determined to make sure that if there were to be a faction it would be one controlled by head office and one that squarely served the interests of the party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fair to say that, during those years he was general secretary, whilst we had a very competitive preselection system there was very rarely a candidate who won a preselection who wasn't the candidate preferred or endorsed by Sir John Carrick. That, in part, reflects the fact that Sir John saw himself in the role of general secretary as responsible for the recruitment of candidates. He traversed the state of New South Wales, making sure that the party had the capacity to put forward to parliament candidates of the highest calibre. Many of them were to be fellow returned servicemen, and some of the greats of the Liberal Party in both state and federal politics at the time were people that he recruited from those ranks. He was determined and believed passionately that the success of the Liberal Party depended on the quality of the candidates he put forward. As general secretary, he regarded that as one of the primary obligations he had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard to fathom the challenge he faced when he first joined the party in the late 1940s. He was there in its infancy. His first role was within months of Menzies founding the party. As general secretary, two years later, at the age of just 30, he had the responsibility of building an entire party organisation effectively from scratch and finding candidates to run immediately for federal and state office. In part, his strength as a general secretary and the influence and success he had was because of the network of field officers he created across the party. Those field officers became his agents, both in electoral politics but also, it's fair to say, in the internal politics of the Liberal Party. When I joined the party, sadly those field officers were in decline, and whilst there were a handful back then, they weren't to last for much longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also fair to say his time in the Liberal Party was highly personally rewarding. The great love of his life, Lady Angela, was a person he met at those Ash Street headquarters in his early years at the party. She was the party librarian and equally committed to the cause. I'm not sure that that type of relationship would be one that would be permitted today, but it was certainly a very fruitful one for Sir John.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John was far more than simply a machine man for the party. His parliamentary career which followed his retirement as general secretary in the early 1970s is testament to that fact. Throughout both his career in the party organisation and in the Senate, he demonstrated such a deep commitment to the values of our party. My predecessor, Joe Hockey, quoted Sir John in his own maiden speech, and I want to repeat that quote. Joe said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A true Liberal was described by Sir John Carrick in 1967 as someone who was always concerned about the welfare of the individual, for the creation of opportunities, for the preservation of human dignity and the development of human personality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was those values that guided his parliamentary career and perhaps shaped his great passion in public life, which of course was for improving education in Australia. Sir John described the role of education in these terms: 'the real role of education is to stimulate people in mind and spirit for what is a limitless adventure'. That passion for education is reflected in his committee service in the Senate and in his role as the federal education minister during the Fraser government. Importantly, it was a passion that he carried beyond his retirement from the Senate. Most notably, when the Greiner government was elected in 1988, the then education minister, Terry Metherell, and Premier Greiner commissioned Sir John to chair a committee which bore his name, in the form of the Carrick report, which reinvented and reshaped school education in New South Wales. It's a legacy that prevails today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to mention, because it's a passion close to my own heart, the fact that, when was unfashionable to do so, Sir John was one of the earliest advocates to end the death penalty in Australia. In fact, the second speech he gave in the Senate, the very day after he had given his maiden speech, was to support a private members bill introduced by Lionel Murphy to abolish the death penalty in federal jurisdictions. He at the time was just one of three Liberal senators who exercised a conscience vote to support that bill, which passed the Senate at the time but failed in the House of Representatives; however, it was importantly enacted just a couple of years later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I only had the privilege of meeting Sir John on a couple of occasions during my own involvement in the Liberal Party. I want to reflect on one of those occasions which, I think, typifies the type of person that Sir John was. In 2005, I had the great pleasure of assisting Joe Hockey in organising North Sydney commemorations for the anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day, what we originally called Victory over Japan. It was a significant commemoration for our veterans. Joe invited Sir John to be the keynote speaker. I vividly remember two things: firstly, his remarks about the values that have been spoken about by other speakers—his commitment to reconciliation, the deep faith he had in human nature, which led him to spend much of his adult life post the Second World War trying to ensure that the horrors of that war did not affect our relationship, not only as individuals but as a nation, with the Japanese people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the thing that struck me about his contribution that day was his extraordinary humility that was reflected in all that he said. It was also reflected in the way he happily spent an hour after the service mingling with schoolchildren who didn't know who Sir John Carrick was. It was the first time in their lives they had met a knight and they were intrigued by that fact and by the impressive medallion he wore as a knight. He happily talked to them and shared his own experiences with those school students for a very long time. It's that humility that we'll most remember Sir John for and it was reflected in his decision to make sure that this family turned down a state funeral—as the Prime Minister pointed out in his speech—because he believed that his life was no more worthy than any of the other veterans who he had served alongside. His humility was reflected when the Liberal Party, over the years, on many occasions discussed whether our own head office should be named in his honour. It was a request or a suggestion that he always turned down because he considered himself a servant of the Liberal Party and no better than any other person who served in that role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I speak today to honour someone who was a child of the Depression, a soldier for Australia, a survivor of those awful prisoner of war camps that he experienced in South-East Asia, a warrior for the Liberal Party and its values, but, most importantly, someone who was committed to further generations, be they the generations to follow him and his own family, or more broadly across Australia, as his commitment to education was so effectively to demonstrate. We have lost a great Australian, and I extend my sincerest condolences to his family.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge the passing of Sir John Carrick AC, KCMG, an eminent Australian politician, public servant, veteran and leader. Sadly, this comes just weeks after I rose in the chamber to acknowledge the passing of his wife, Lady Angela Carrick AO. Sir John and Lady Angela Carrick were residents of Bradfield for many years, in Bent Street, Lindfield. Sir John was a member of the Killara branch of the Liberal Party for decades. Sir John Carrick was a Liberal senator for New South Wales for many years. He served variously as the Minister for Education, Minister for National Development and Energy, and Leader of the Government in the Senate. He is one of the most distinguished figures in Australian politics over the last 80 years, who was instrumental in working with Sir Robert Menzies to transform the Liberal Party from a fledgling political movement in New South Wales in the 1940s, to the major party it is today. He served for 23 years as the general secretary of the New South Wales Liberal Party and advised countless leaders, including John Howard, Sir Robert Menzies and Malcolm Fraser.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth reflecting on Sir John's remarkable history of service. He served with distinction in the Australian Army in World War II. Enlisting as a lieutenant in the Sydney University Regiment in 1939, he deployed to West Timor in December 1941 with the Australia Army's Sparrow Force. They fought bravely against overwhelming odds before being taken prisoner, and Sir John was a prisoner of war of the Japanese at Changi prison and spent time on the infamous Thai-Burma railway and at Hellfire Pass. Whilst interred as a prisoner of war, Sir John acquired a considerable command of the Japanese language, which assisted in the communication with his captors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John earned the respect of his fellow prisoners of war through the way that he supported them, and he described his period in captivity subsequently as a 'great and enduring learning experience'. That speaks volumes of his nature as a human being to be so generous and reflective in his observations on what was undoubtedly a traumatising and appalling experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After returning to Australia, Sir John worked as a research officer for the New South Wales Liberal Party from 1946. Two years later, having greatly impressed senior figures in the party, he was appointed General Secretary of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party, and for the next 23 years he built what is arguably the most effective political organisation in the history of politics in New South Wales. He established the template for political engagement and community advocacy within the Liberal Party, and it's worth reflecting on the scale of mass community engagement with political parties at that time. His work was instrumental in the scale of engagement which the Liberal Party was able to have throughout the community. He worked tirelessly, travelling all across the state and throughout communities across New South Wales, encouraging participation and campaigning on the foundational values of the Liberal Party. For people who have been involved in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party for many years such as the member for North Sydney, who spoke previously, and such as I and, of course, many other members and senators in this place, it is instructive to observe how much the institutions and the practices and the values of the modern Liberal Party very much reflect the work that Sir John did in those early days as the party was growing and building momentum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elected as a senator for New South Wales in 1971, Sir John served in the parliament with the same efficiency, professionalism and commitment to the community that he demonstrated as General Secretary of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party for 23 years. Of course, he rose to high ministerial office, serving as Minister for Education, Minister for National Development and Energy and Leader of the Government in the Senate. Although he held a number of portfolios, perhaps it is his time as education minister which speaks most to his passions and the contribution that he sought to make to our nation. It was certainly a policy area for which he had great enthusiasm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of Sir John Carrick's characteristics is that he did not seek personal fame or reputation. He served the community and the Liberal Party selflessly and he worked to advance the views that he felt resonated throughout the Australian community at a time when, as a nation, we were very much engaged in a process of nation building, recovering from the traumatic experience of World War II and throwing open the national arms to people from around the world as our population grew, as our confidence grew and as the scale of our nation grew. Sir John was absolutely critical to that process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was, in every way, deserving of the title, which is often accorded to his generation, in our country and others—the greatest generation—those who sacrificed so much in World War II and went on to build their nations. His is a life story of experience in extraordinary hardship and privation, including some quite challenging times as a child and teenager during the Depression. He devoted himself to the task of shaping our nation and, particularly, shaping our political life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a young man, he fought for Australia's freedom and for our values as a soldier. As a party official and parliamentarian, he spent decades fighting for freedom and fighting for Australian values, and he did so with enormous effectiveness. There is no person who better encapsulates the values for which the Liberal Party stands. He stood for aspiration, he stood for community involvement, and he stood for fairness and equality of opportunity. He believed deeply in the inherent value of individual freedom and the centrality of free enterprise to a successful and fair society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, therefore, with great sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Sir John Carrick AC KCMG and the loss of one of Australia's most distinguished leaders and faithful servants. On behalf of the people of Bradfield, I particularly express our collective sadness at the deaths of Sir John and of Lady Angela Carrick within such a short space of time. They are survived by their daughters, Diane, Jane and Fiona and their extended family, and I express my condolences to the extended family.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first joined the New South Wales Liberal Party in 1968, Senator Carrick was then the general secretary of the party. I was pleased to be able to attend his memorial service last Saturday, along with some now not-as-young Young Liberals, Philip and Heather Ruddock, Robyn Kerr, Bruce McCarthy and many others. Former Senator Nick Minchin was also in Sydney but unable to attend the service, so I offered to include his words today: 'It was a great privilege to know John Carrick and be inspired by him to follow in his footsteps as a Liberal state director, senator and government leader in the Senate. John was a true Liberal hero, a humble man and great man who was an inspiration to so many of us.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you would expect, it was a moving service with wonderful eulogies and memories from family and friends. From former Prime Minister John Howard and Sir John Carrick's biographer, Graeme Starr, to his grandchildren, all of course Pa's favourite, and all with loving and special childhood memories. I should note that the service was held at one of Sydney's historic churches, St Paul's Burwood, which is just two years shy of being 150 years old and notably still has real bells and bellringers and at the end of the service the bells were rung 99 times, once for each year of Sir John's life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Carrick, as I knew him, was one of a number World War II veterans on both sides of the House and the Senate who came to politics after the war with a deep and abiding commitment to public service in the very best sense of those words. Then Senator Robert Cotton convinced him to stand for the Senate and I feel honoured and privileged to have worked for him. Indeed, when I joined his staff in 1975 the Senate included Robert Cotton, John Carrick, Ivor Greenwood and Reg Withers, a most formidable team. He was a generous, considerate and inclusive boss. Always proper and always on top of his brief, he was a good friend whose political advice was worth its weight in gold, as was his advice generally. Even after I left his staff and moved to Queensland he was always available whenever I needed advice. He could always find time to talk, even to a junior staffer just starting in politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like my father, a prisoner of war, his character was forged through war, Changi and the Burma railway. He described his captivity as 'a great and enduring learning experience', which through 'the strong amalgam of mateship' disclosed reserves of spirituality and moral strength in his fellow prisoners. I remember how concerned he was when veterans with whom he had served, who like him has survived and come home and rebuilt their lives, had later need to apply for a TPI pension. He always stressed the importance of staying fit, physically and mentally. Every day that I worked for him, he went for either a walk or a swim and every morning he would give the staff a small puzzle or riddle to ensure that we exercised our minds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I paid tribute to Sir John Carrick in my maiden speech in this place as a special leader, a great mentor and a man of immeasurable compassion. I noted that, when considering new legislation, he always cautioned us to be mindful of our responsibility to assist those in need, and, as we all know, he was passionate about the importance of education. In establishing the Carrick Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education, Dr Brendan Nelson, as the then minister for education, said of him:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Sir John Carrick has made an enormous contribution to our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He did many things, but one of them was the establishment of the National Tertiary Education Commission, to play for the first time, a serious role in co-ordinating the higher education sector throughout Australia and at arm’s length from Government ... of all of the people that I have met in my adult life there are few that I consider more noble and decent, nor intelligent nor committed to the cause of education ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The name of the Carrick Institute was immediately accepted throughout the university sector and beyond. Even in political circles there was no express disapproval and the Carrick Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education was an immediate success. I can still recall the day, many years earlier, when we were unable to leave our offices in Chifley Square as a result of a large student protest outside. As staff and security officers rushed around in a panic trying to find ways to get the minister out of the building, we turned and found Senator Carrick calmly cutting out paper dolls for the then very young Melanie Howard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the memorial service on Saturday, we were all given a white rose and a copy of a poem that Senator Carrick had handwritten with a notation: 'I've no idea of its origin or author. I doubt that I've ever seen it in print. It is out of my childhood.' Indeed, it exemplifies how Senator Carrick approached his life. Well, Senator Carrick, I will now read it into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> so that it is in print with your name for perpetuity. It's known as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bridge Builder</span> and reads:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John Carrick's generation of senators and members set standards that are applicable today because they stand the test of time. Knowing Senator Carrick also included knowing his wonderful family: his wife Lady Angela Carrick, who sadly passed away just a few months ago, and his daughters, Diane, Jane and Fiona. My thoughts are with them and their children and grandchildren. Just as your mother made such an enormous contribution generally and to the Girl Guides movement in particular, your father was a giant of a man whose contribution to our nation should never be underestimated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Man has always shown himself more willing to seek to understand his material environment than to understand himself or his neighbours. Indeed, in recent decades, we have given great prominence to the physicists, the chemists, the engineers, and their kindred scientists, while failing to appreciate that mankind's currently intractable problems are those essentially for the philosopher, the educator, the psychologist and the political scientist.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to the late the Honourable Sir John Carrick AC KCMG. I never met Sir John Carrick and I did not know him personally. Nonetheless, I know him by his reputation for his contribution to our great party, the Liberal Party, the movement and the cause of liberalism in Australia and also his service to our great nation. Sir John Carrick was elected to the Senate in 1970 and served until his retirement in 1987. He had a long and illustrious political career, including rising to the level of Minister for Housing and Construction, Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Minister for Education and the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on Federal Affairs, National Development and Energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The interest I have in Sir John Carrick is not just about his roles and professional capacity, but the values and philosophy that sit at the heart of his liberalism. Liberalism is the greatest political philosophy the world has ever known. It has endured over every type of 'ism' and extremism that has ever reared its head in competition. Over time, through the process of understanding of the human condition and our aspiration, it has endured against incredible difficulties at times. Sir John Carrick represented the best of that tradition. He understood that the foundations of liberalism were to aspire to a society where people are free to choose their life and their circumstances, free to be able to change their circumstances if they found them undesirable, and free to live their lives as they want, understanding not just the primacy of the rights of the individual but, importantly, the foundational building block of our country, which is the family, towards community and, ultimately, nationhood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, Sir John Carrick understood that the foundation of liberalism was also anchored in a sense of justice—not just respect towards the individual but our collective bond and sharing responsibility to each other. He recognised on so many occasions the importance of a sense of national unity, particularly around rejecting a lot of sectarian elements that existed within Australian society at the time. There was no better demonstration of that than his advocacy for public funding for faith based schools, particularly the Catholic system. He recognised that, no matter who you are, if you want to live an enlivened life of freedom and choice, you have to have choice about where you go to school and, equally, where you seek to have your children go to school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first speech, Sir John Carrick made remarks along these lines: 'I do not stand for any section of the community. The people I represent are not represented by the size of their pay packets, by colour or shirt collar, or by the nature of their religious devotion. Divisiveness is the evil of politics, and I hope to do something to reduce it.' Throughout his political career, Sir John Carrick did just that—by focusing on that sense of unity and purpose, national identity and freedom of choice. He was a man of his times. When I read his history and some of his contributions, I did raise my eyebrows. In particular, there was his advocacy for the virtues of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. But, as I said, he was a man of his times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, though, he was a man who understood that the heart of any successful political career and the heart of the pursuit of what the Liberal Party should stand for was anchored in values and philosophy. He wrote extensively about this, particularly for the public, in various contributions. It struck me in David Clune's review of a more recent book titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Carrick: Principles, Politics and Polity</span>. Clune wrote of Carrick that 'his definition of Liberal philosophy placed much emphasis on "the potential of the individual"' but it 'rejected both laissez-faire and collectivism as threats to "the development of individual dignity"'. He understood that the Liberal Party must be a party for every Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than anything else, when you read through his history and his contribution to public life, Carrick represented the foundations of great Liberal philosophy and then sought to put it into practice. He understood that the foundation of liberalism is a cultural and institutional conservatism. In fact, I found an article from 1973 where he was arguing that, in the choice of a new national anthem, <span style="font-style:italic;">God Save </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Queen</span> should at least be part of the selection choices. He understood the power of symbols and of the institutions that we have inherited and the importance of their roles continuing on into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, critically, he also understood the power of economic and social liberalism to chart a course for the future of the country. He understood that the future of this country was not bound solely by its past but that there are alternative choices about whether we seek to be a liberal democracy or a social democracy and that the Liberal Party and its values are enlivened best when we extol the virtues of liberalism and a forward-looking vision for our country. To quote his first speech again in my closing remarks:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have one great hope. I believe that in the vision of the future to meet the challenges of the future, the great solutions and the great motivations not being created by economic instruments will be created by a new philosophy of education. … in rethinking our education research, in studying as our main subject not material science but man, we will come some way towards the solutions. It is high time man was less preoccupied with material science and more preoccupied with the only study that matters—man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is to say that we should always have a vision of how we can shape the future. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  I stand today to speak on the memory of a great Australian, Sir John Leslie Carrick AC, KCMG. Sir John Carrick was a man who lived a full and rich 99 years of life. He was a father, a husband, a soldier, a politician and a friend of many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John first heeded the call of patriotism and service to his country in 1940, when he joined the Australian Imperial Force. In 1943 Sir John was captured and taken as a Japanese prisoner of war. He spent more than three years in prison camps, including the infamous Changi prison camp in Singapore. He also worked on the Burma-Thailand railway, where he endured the brutality and cruelty displayed towards Australian prisoners of war. Despite all of this, Sir John's love of his country endured, and when he returned to Australia he did not lose his patriotic resolve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John is seen by many as one of the people most responsible for developing the Liberal Party from an idea into the most representative and influential political party in Australian politics. Sir John served as a Liberal Party senator for the state of New South Wales between 1971 and 1987. During this time he held multiple ministerial positions in the Fraser government, including Minister for National Development and Energy, Minister for Education, Minister for Urban and Regional Development and Minister for Housing and Construction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first met Sir John about 20 years ago, and I only met him twice. He spoke clearly about the importance of Liberal ideals in a modern society but, most critically, about how, when they fall in and out of favour—despite the fact that they are timeless—and when they are forgotten, they too often lead to oppression. I once asked him why he was so strongly supportive of state support for Catholic schools in the 1960s. It was one of the most powerful statements that I've heard in public life. He said, 'When I was a prisoner in Changi they didn't ask you if you were a Catholic or a Protestant, because we were all Australians. We were all there fighting to survive but also fighting to preserve freedom and our country. I was not,' he said, 'fighting for a Catholic Australia or a Protestant Australia. I was fighting for Australia, no more, no less.' So when he returned to Australia and found law firms that were Catholic and law firms that were Protestant—even department stores that only employed Catholics and other department stores that only employed Protestants—he said, 'This is not the Australia I had been fighting for. More importantly, this is not the Australia that many of my comrades had died for, that my comrades in arms had died to protect.' So when the time came, when this issue had reached its pinnacle, he said to Menzies, who was then the Prime Minister: 'This is not the country that I fought and suffered for. I fought for a country where your religion did not matter, and that is what state support meant to me.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John's memory lives on in the hearts and minds of all those in the Liberal Party. As a titan of the Liberal Party—as one of the great three, as Anthony Albanese described him—his name will be remembered in the league of our two most loyal servants: former prime ministers Sir Robert Menzies and John Howard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir John's beloved wife, Lady Angela Carrick AO, like him dedicated her life to the service of others, including her time spent as Chief Commissioner of Girl Guides Australia in the mid-1980s. She passed away in February of this year. I recognise her and her commitment to this country as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of myself and the people of Mackellar, I offer my most heartfelt condolences to his three daughters—Diane, Jane and Fiona—as well as to the whole Carrick family. To Sir John I say, 'Thank you for your service to your country through your time in the armed services and in the Australian Senate. Thank you for your contribution to the Liberal Party and for the advice and support you provided to me early on in my career.' Lest we forget.</span>

Shortly, the Federation Chamber will be asked to agree to a proposed schedule for the times for consideration of portfolios. This may need to be varied upon. It is a useful guide to assist ministers and members to arrange their commitments. Chairs will not be seeking to enforce this arrangement strictly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consideration in detail is a debate, and the call will be alternated between the government and non-government sides as always. Even though this debate sometimes takes the format of question and answer, this is not question time. Ministers and government backbench members both will be considered as speakers on the government side, and should bear this in mind when they seek the call. All speakers are required to be relevant to whichever portfolio is being examined, but there is no requirement of direct relevance in respect of any responses. It might be practical for ministers to respond to more than one speaker when they seek the call, and I note that this general arrangement applied last year and seemed to allow maximum participation in this stage of debate. Each minister and member will have up to five minutes to speak each time they are called, but they may wish to speak for a shorter time. Ministers may wish to make an introductory statement when debate on their portfolios begins, but, as they are not moving amendments, that is a matter for them to decide.</span>

I also take the opportunity to indicate to the Federation Chamber that the proposed order for consideration of portfolios estimates has been discussed with the opposition, and there has been no objection to what is proposed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  I've got a series of questions for the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Minister, I want to commend the frontline officers in the Australian Border Force for the important work they do in protecting our borders, particularly in Far North Queensland, the Torres Strait and North Queensland. Their work includes operations to combat transnational crime and prevent drug running, and those officers protect our environment and tourism industry by shutting down illegal fishing ventures in the Torres Strait, North Queensland and Far North Queensland. It is critical that these officers have the best and most reliable equipment available to them to do their job, something I'm sure that all members of this chamber would agree with. Minister, why, then, in the last 12 months have two ABF vessels in North Queensland crashed into or scraped against the Great Barrier Reef?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been revealed that the front was torn off the <span style="font-style:italic;">Roebuck Bay</span> vessel at a cost of $3 million. Now we're hearing one of the new fast-response boats has scraped a reef after issues with the navigational system. Minister, are these the same fast-response vessels or boats that you promised the people of Cairns and Far North Queensland in 2015 that were delayed time and time again until 2018? Minister, your department has admitted it knows what's wrong with the navigational system on this vessel. Minister, could you tell the chamber what's wrong with the navigational equipment and does it affect both new fast-response boats? Will you explain which reef was hit in particular, what damage was sustained, how long it will take to repair, and what the cost will be? What's the opportunity cost as well?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the national security implications for the people of Far North Queensland, the Torres Strait and North Queensland? Minister, will you announce for the people of Cairns, Far North Queensland and North Queensland today when these fast-response vessels will be fully operational and glitch-free? Minister, is it true they will now have to wait until August for the two new fast-response boats to be repaired and fully operational? And when these boats are finally delivered, will the government have an answer for how lead and Legionella has been detected in the onboard water supply for the ABF Cape Class vessels?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues were first reported in December 2017. In estimates last week, when these issues were raised by Labor, the Australian Border Force officer listed a range of possibilities but, ultimately, admitted: 'I can't answer your question specifically, because I don't know the answer.' Minister, when will you know the answer and tell us the answer? And while you're there, it was reported in November 2017 that the same Cape Class vessels were struggling to launch smaller response craft. I believe your department calls these boats 'tender response vessels' and, in November 2017, the department admitted it was trying to resolve 'an issue relating to the operation of ships' boats on some Cape Class patrol boats'. Minister, have all these issues been resolved? And are all these Cape Class vessels now operating as they should?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  Few issues demonstrate the difference between the coalition and the Labor-Greens alliance more starkly than the immigration debate. Even in these two sitting weeks, we have witnessed time and time again Labor members speaking out against the facade that is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to manage Australia's borders. What a contrast to the coalition's strong policy and enforcement regime. The government's highly effective policies, so ably implemented by the Minister for Home Affairs, who stands resolute against any weakening of our immigration system that would again see over 50,000 illegal arrivals arrive on 800 boats and more than 1,200 lives lost at sea. But despite these differences, I would like to think that all members of this parliament do share at least a pride in our country—a love for Australia. And what defines our nation more than anything else is a common set of values—values such as respecting individual freedoms, upholding freedom of religion, a commitment to the rule of law, a firm faith in parliamentary democracy, and equal opportunity for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country needs more people who understand and embrace these values. We also need people who recognise that they are part of something far bigger than themselves. We need people who will freely mix and integrate with their neighbours, schoolmates, workplace colleagues. Such interaction reinforces our true social network—the code of mateship, if you like, that defines a strong and free Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Edmund Burke once spoke of 'the little platoons' to which people belong as 'the first link in a series in which we proceed to a love of our country and mankind'. In other words, in addition to needing people who embrace our common set of values, we need people who are active in their own local platoons, we need people who will actively participate in civil society. It is only through civil society that Australia's culture is enriched and our way of life protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why do I speak of such things? The reason is simple. There is a group of people spread right across Australia, around 3,000 in total, who are currently on retirement visas—specifically, subclass 405 and 410 retirement visas. In many cases, these are people who, after many years and at significant cost to themselves, have demonstrated a clear track record of embracing our values as a nation and contributing so positively to our civil society. In my electorate of Fairfax, I know many of these people well. I am thinking about people like Doug and Sonia Brotchie. The Brotchies live in Buderim. They are not only very decent people; they are also generous contributors to the community—volunteering to make their little platoon, their local community, more vibrant and enriched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the 3000-odd retirement visa holders living in Australia have resided in this country for more than 10 years. Like the Brotchies, they call Australia home. They have close family members and good neighbours who have become Australian citizens. But until now, until this budget measure that I address today, they were ineligible for permanent residency themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to thank the minister for his leadership, his strength of character and the resolve he continues to demonstrate in the Home Affairs portfolio. We need to hold onto the values that we have as a nation. The 405s and 410s in this country, many of whom have resided here for over 10 years, have already demonstrated that commitment to values and to our civil society. With that in mind, can the minister advise what the government is doing to recognise the contribution to Australia of retirement visa holders and why it is important for retirement visa holders to have access to a pathway to permanent residency.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  We on this side of the chamber think governments have a right to establish departments and make machinery-of-government changes. Labor has supported the government in their creation of the Department of Home Affairs. In a sense, we let them do it; we didn't oppose it. Governments of all persuasions have a right to establish the departments they want. But we note that the Department of Home Affairs was established without any recommendation from any review to establish it in the national interest. And the government didn't rely on the advice of security agencies to create the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, I notice that, in the budget, you have set aside $7 million to review the Department of Home Affairs, which has only been operating for about five months. It has been confirmed that this is a strategic capability review—a review of the portfolio's suite of capabilities across all of its business functions—and that the department intends to engage external contractors to assist with the detailed mapping of the current suite of capabilities. Minister, the terms set out by the department seem to suggest that there are some powers or functions currently missing from the Department of Home Affairs. What do you think is missing, and what new functions would you aggregate to yourself to bring into this new megadepartment? This review has been budgeted at $7 million but the department has confirmed that this will only cover the cost of external contractors, with other staff costs to be absorbed within existing resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, what is the true cost of this review once you factor in existing staff time and what is the opportunity cost for the department? How many people will be pulled off other jobs to come and review your new megadepartment? Minister, will this review specifically look at how immigration has been lost in the megadepartment? I notice the Home Affairs portfolio division of ministerial responsibilities made almost no mention of migration in your particular responsibilities. I notice the traditional immigration minister responsibilities have been spread across three ministers and, of course, one assistant minister despite the fact that, Minister, you're actually holding the title of Minister for Immigration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Your department doesn't seem to have the best track record when it comes to external reviews. We only have to look at the RAND Corporation review, established by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection in 2016, which criticised and talked about the culture and the failures of the merger of the Department of Immigration and Customs. I eagerly anticipate the Auditor-General's report into the same merger. Minister, will you release any report or any findings into this new $7 million Home Affairs review so the Australian public can judge for themselves how successful this new megadepartment has been?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  Since 1901 Australia has been a sovereign nation, and the key task of the government is to safeguard our sovereignty. That means having secure borders. It's been 1,403 days since we've had an illegal maritime arrival on our shores—1,403 days since we've had a boat. So I think the first thing I want to do is acknowledge the work of the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and the Minister for Law Enforcement, who represent a triumvirate of competence that the Australian people can have great confidence in. They take their work very, very seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When John Howard left government in 2007, there were only four illegal maritime arrivals in detention, and none of those were children. And then we saw the election of the Rudd government in late 2007. In the Rudd government Labor proceeded to unwind the coalition's policies. They proceeded to weaken our border policies, and the results were a disaster. They were terrible. And it's worth reflecting on the raw, hard facts. And these facts go like this: under Labor, over 50,000 people arrived on over 800 boats. There were 1,200 deaths at sea, and those are the deaths that we know of. Eight thousand children were detained while Labor was in government. At the height of Labor's dismal failure in July 2013, there were 10,201 people in detention, including almost 2,000 children. Seventeen detention centres needed to open to deal with the influx of illegal arrivals. Not that this is about money, because most important are the people involved, and, tragically, lives were lost, but, on the topic of money, this led to a budget blow-out of $16 billion. That was $16 billion that could have been invested elsewhere in health, education and other areas that our country needs investing in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, it diminished confidence in the government. The public lost confidence in the Australian government. It also diminished our relative strength with our neighbours. People can hardly take you seriously if you can't secure your borders. However, since this government was elected in 2013, we commenced Operation Sovereign Borders. We've turned around Labor's failure and taken back control of our borders from people smugglers. We've ended the chaos and we've restored policies, including turnbacks where it's been safe to do so, offshore processing and temporary protection visas for those in need. This has acted as a significant deterrent to people smugglers. We've shut down their operation and we have some good facts to reflect on, which I'll do very briefly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it's been over 1,400 days since a boat arrival. We've stopped deaths at sea. There have been zero deaths at sea since Operation Sovereign Borders was initiated. We have closed 17 detention centres. And there is something we all are very proud of: we've removed all children from detention. We've also restored integrity to our immigration system, which means we've been able to increase our generous humanitarian program, rising from 13,750 refugees in 2013-14 to 18,750 in 2018-19. That also meant that we could extend hospitality to people from Syria in the Syrian crisis, with an additional intake of 12,000 Syrian refugees. We're also working closely with the United States to resettle people off Manus and Nauru. I acknowledge the work the Prime Minister did in fighting hard to protect the national interest early after President Trump was elected to his current office. Already 249 people have been resettled in the United States. The results speak volumes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I have two questions for the minister. Can the minister advise whether the government has made provisions in the 2018 budget to continue or enhance Operation Sovereign Borders? And does he see any threats to the continued successful outcomes for the government's actions?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:21</span>):  Minister, your government recently changed the eligibility for the Status Resolution Support Services, or SRSS as it's commonly known in the asylum seeker, refugee and not-for-profit sectors. Stakeholders have said changes to the Status Resolution Support Services began in August 2017 and the department has stated that, in February this year, you approved changes to the SRSS. When did it actually happen? And what's the budget cost or advantage in relation to this change? That program, of course, as you know, provides a small payment available to help support people who are waiting for your department to process their visa applications. It helps more than 12,000 people pay their rent, buy food and meet basic costs for themselves, their families and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given you made this decision to change the program months ago, allegedly, why can't your department answer a simple question about who will be impacted by the change? Surely this was modelled by the department. If so, when was the modelling done? Who did the modelling? What was the cost of the modelling? And what was the recommendation that was made by the department? Minister, how many of these people stand to lose their assistance as a result of your decision? And how many of those families have young children? Have you contacted your state and territory counterparts to advise them of your intention to cut off these payments or how it may impact on the welfare of children in their jurisdiction for which they have parens patriae? How will the vulnerability assessments work that your department will undertake? And will you guarantee that children will not be forced into homelessness or be put at risk as a result of this decision?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, why have you chosen to remove the SRSS support from people who are studying full-time while they're waiting for your department to assess their applications for visas, especially when it's been reported that the full-time study that some of these people are undertaking is to learn English? Do you accept, Minister, that purposefully making these people destitute and homeless can only exacerbate the difficulties they face in the community?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  Thank you very much to all of the members who have contributed. I'd like to address some of the issues that have been raised. The first question put by the honourable member for Blair was in relation to incidents that had taken place in the north of Australia and accidents that had taken place there. These matters were canvassed in Senate estimates, as the honourable member would be aware. I would just refer him to some of the exchange between Senator Carr; the commissioner, Mr Outram; and also the deputy commissioner, Ms Newton. To go specifically to the cost, $3 million was the approximate cost of repairing the ship, as Mr Outram said. The crew have been spoken to. They were tested for alcohol and those sorts of things when they came ashore. I've got no information to suggest that there was any wrongdoing, deliberate or otherwise. There is nothing at the moment that I've been presented with that suggests it is anything other than an accident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of our crew, navigators and commanding officers are trained up to standards that obviously satisfy AMSA requirements. There may be lessons to learn out of the report, but at this stage, until I get the report, there is no basis on which to take action against any officers. I just reiterate the words of the honourable member in relation to the outstanding service of those ABF frontline officers who crewed those individual vessels—and who crew vessels right around the area of responsibility—that they protect and defend, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second question, from the honourable member for Fairfax, was in relation to retirement visas. I really pay tribute to him and to the representations that he made to me on behalf of constituents within his electorate on the Sunshine Coast. I am pleased to inform that, from 2018-19, retirement visa holders in Australia will be eligible to apply onshore for a permanent visa through the parent subclass 103 or the contributory parent subclass 143 visa streams. Retirement visa holders will be exempted from some parent visa requirements that they would typically be unable to meet, such as having family in Australia. The pathway will remain open until all retirement visa holders who wish to transition to permanent residence have done so. This measure is one which I know is wholeheartedly supported by members on both sides of the House. Again, I really do acknowledge the significant work by the member for Fairfax, the member for Fisher and others on the Sunshine Coast that brought those very real concerns to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a question in relation to the construct of the Home Affairs portfolio. Obviously the idea is for us to find efficiencies where there's duplication in effort, particularly back-office effort, and try to push that money back into frontline roles. We want to make sure that we deal with the very significant terrorism threat that our country faces. We want to make sure that we are dealing as best we can with the other threats in organised and serious crime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would welcome very much the opportunity for the member opposite to take up the position of shadow minister for home affairs, because as yet, I regret to say, he hasn't been elevated to that position.

It builds on his work as a uniformed officer, most notably his time in the SAS. He brings a unique skill set to this job, and he is one of the staunchest advocates, particularly in Western Australia, for the continuation of Operation Sovereign Borders so that we can keep the boats stopped, so that we can stop those children and women from drowning at sea and to make sure that we don't put children back into detention from boats. I commend the honourable member for Canning for his considerable efforts.</span>

I'm happy to take the question. There was, as the secretary of the department pointed out, a mistake made in relation to the attribution of that comment. It was inappropriate that the comment was attributed to the department. In my experience I have found the department to be professional on every occasion. They abide by the impartiality you would expect from a Commonwealth government department, and that applies to the secretary down. I recognise the independence and impartiality across the whole portfolio of the approach of the professional officers within the department. The statement, as I say, was wrongly attributed to the department. I've conveyed that to the secretary and, as the shadow minister points out, the secretary's made comments on the record in that regard.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I am very pleased today to talk about home affairs, citizenship and multicultural affairs in relation to consideration in detail. Relevant to the Home Affairs portfolio, I am secretary of the backbench committee for home affairs, and chair of the Foreign Affairs and Aid Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. We undertook the modern slavery inquiry last year, which has now led to the proposed modern slavery bill which will be introduced soon by the coalition government through the Home Affairs portfolio.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Australia is a nation of immigrants. Our culture is strongly influenced by the many backgrounds of those who make up our communities. Some of Dunkley's residents' backgrounds, other than Australian, of course, include British, Irish, German, Italian, Dutch, Chinese, Greek, Indian, New Zealand, Polish, French, Thai, South Sudanese and more. After English, in Dunkley the most common spoken languages at home are Greek, Mandarin, Italian, German and Malayalam.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plight of Yazidis in the Syria and Iraq conflict is also something that I have talked about recently. It's a subject on which I have learnt a lot about very quickly and of which I am striving to make people aware. I moved a motion in parliament recently, recognising the genocide against them by ISIS. Nihad, a woman I met in London as part of my committee's modern slavery inquiry is a Yazidi person who was captured by ISIS, sold and raped, and has never seen the baby she gave birth to since. She has since begun a new life in Australia and had her application for Australia's protection accepted. It is a great credit to the Minister for Home Affairs and other ministers under the Home Affairs portfolio for giving her and many other Yazidis and persecuted minorities another lease of life. There are many individuals affected in Australia. There are plenty of people who move to Australia who want to begin a new life and who we need to help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Yazidi motion that I moved in parliament a couple of months ago, the Yazidi community here want to integrate, but also want to share their stories so that Australians are aware of their plight. Hundreds of Yazidis have settled in Australia and several thousand are from Iraq and Syria. This year, Australia has accepted 18,750 people fleeing persecution. Nihad, the person I mentioned before, said</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I don't want to come just to see the Yazidis; I want to change my life, I want to change everything … Australia will become my first home and my last one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people who move to Australia want to live an Australian way of life and want to integrate into our community, especially those subject to the trauma of these kinds of experiences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, the South Sudanese community in my electorate of Dunkley are also working through a number of different organisation whose are helping them to integrate. One is the Sudanese homework and learning club in partnership with MiCare, the New Hope Foundation, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and Woodley School, helping young Sudanese students get the support and build the networks they need. Also St Peter's Lutheran and Karingal Uniting Church has a large South Sudanese congregation, and I recently joined them for the installation of their new special pastor, Peter Deng.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This leads me to my question, which is on a very important issue for the Yazidis, the South Sudanese and others in my community, I might add. Minister, many people, when they move to Australia, want to begin new lives and embrace their new community. The Fostering Integration Grants program announced in the 2018-19 federal budget looks like it will work towards these aims in helping the Azidi community, the local South Sudanese community and many others. Can you please tell us more about this grants program and other programs helping these communities?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Minister, you've confirmed that your department is completing preparatory work on a global digital platform. That platform has been described by concerned workers as the privatisation of visa-processing services. The department has refused to rule out any redundancies, and confirmed that the ultimate scope of work to be sent out to a private company, all merged into a new computer system, will need to be a decision of government. What's that decision? When is it likely to take place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minster, as you would be aware, the former Department of Immigration and Border Protection failed to meet mandated cybersecurity standards not once but twice, despite assurances to the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit that it would be compliant in 2016, after the first damning audit by the Auditor-General in 2014. Details publicly available about this proposal raise serious and legitimate concerns about the integrity of the decision-making process and about the protection of privacy of the more than one million people who visited Australia last year—indeed, every year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, have you set any boundaries on what work would be sent out to the private sector or made it clear that you want the jobs of Department of Home Affairs staff protected in the process? If you haven't done that, will you? Will you tell us when? What safeguards will you put in place to ensure visas to Australia aren't being granted by a tick-a-box online survey and that Australian Department of Home Affairs frontline staff will still have a role in processing visa applications? Will you, Minister, stand up today and say to those 2,000 frontline visa-processing staff who are worried about their jobs that they will have a job next year? Will you hear their concerns? Will you guarantee that frontline visa-processing officers will not lose those jobs as a result of any decision of the Turnbull government to send this work out to a private company?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  As the minister will know, there's been widespread judicial recognition of the seriousness of the threat to law and order in Australia posed by the organised criminal activity of the Construction, Forestry, Mining, Maritime and Energy Union, now called the CFMMEU. Justice Jeffrey Flick said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage any worse conduct than that pursued by the CFMEU.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Justice Rangiah called its conduct 'deliberate, flagrant and systematic', while Justice Vasta said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is no understatement to describe the CFMEU as the most recidivist corporate offender in Australian history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between 1999 and 2015 CFMEU officials committed 106 separate contraventions of industrial laws. Victorian CFMMEU secretary John Setka has confessed on national television that his union has an avowed organisational strategy to break the law. He said in an interview with Sky News earlier in May:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We get fantastic pay rises and good conditions for our members because we fight … outside the law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Justice Collier put it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the record of contraventions on the part of the CFMMEU bespeaks an organisational culture …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Setka certainly embraces that culture wholeheartedly. He's been found guilty of no fewer than 59 offences, including assault and theft, and been jailed twice, indeed, for contempt of court. He is far from alone. Other notables, just in the Queensland CFMMEU, include organiser Justin Steele, who has racked up $40,000 in fines; assistant state secretary Jade Ingham, with $30,000 in fines to his name; and Kane Pearson, who has received $37,500 in fines, including convictions for threatening and intimidating government officials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the royal commission, former National Union of Workers employee Danielle O'Brien pleaded guilty to 148 charges of fraud and two counts of participation in a criminal group, while Derrick Belan, the former head of that union in New South Wales, has been found guilty of 60 fraud offences and one criminal group offence, gaining more than $650,000 from his illegality. All too often the victims of these union crimes are either innocent public servants or the very workers that unions claim to represent. CFMEU President Dave Hanna, for example, was fined $10,500 in May last year for threatening on a work site to bury an innocent bystander's mobile phone down their throat. Most appalling among the recent cases has been the behaviour of CFMEU workers at the work site of Glencore's Oaky Creek north mine. Workers who were simply doing their jobs were told that union members were going to attack them with a crowbar and even that they would rape the workers' children—and those are simply the comments that can be repeated in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland alone, the courts have imposed $2.4 million in fines for offences across 25 separate worksites on the CFMEU in just the past 18 months. The lawless action of the union affects not only the workers they purport to represent but the workers they intimidate and assault. It hurts not only the businesses they extort and harass or the courts they obstruct and lie to; it hurts—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Minister, you are now responsible for visa operations and visa reforms, according to the information from the department. During the federal election, the coalition followed Labor's lead and announced a new temporary parent visa. The coalition promised that 'children would be required to pay a bond', but the government has since announced that children—that is, adult children—will need to pay a fee, not a bond. Where's the budget reference to this, by the way, Minister? The fee will be $10,000 for five years and $5,000 for three years, which is expected to raised $99 million for the budget coffers over the forward estimates. I would like you to point out where that is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Migrant community stakeholders have confirmed that, during the election, the minister's office told them there would be no cap on this visa, but your government capped the visas at 15,000 visas per year. But the cruellest act of all was to put migrant adult children in the tough situation where couples needed to choose between their parents and in-laws, because only one set of parents are allowed to be sponsored at any one time. There was no mention of that before the election. None of the four Home Affairs ministers in the current portfolio have offered any advice to migrant communities about how to sit around the dinner table and make that choice—a pretty uncomfortable decision and pretty uncomfortable conversation to have to have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, why have you broken your parent visa promises to migrant communities? Why is the Turnbull government making families choose between parents and parents-in-law? What's the policy benefit of making couples choose between their parents? And why didn't the minister mention this before the election? Why didn't the government mention it at all in opposition? Despite announcing the visa in the election campaign, the government has repeatedly said that the creation of this new parent visa is reliant on the successful passage of the Migration Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2016. Minister, that bill was introduced on 1 September 2016 and it was passed in the House of Representatives, with the support of the Labor opposition, on 10 October 2016—the same year. Since then, it's been sitting in the Senate waiting for the government to make this bill law so that this new parent visa is a priority for families and a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When will your government prioritise the creation of new visa pathways for parents by bringing this bill on and creating the new visa? Is there any problem you're not telling us about? Why have you kept migrant families in limbo? Have there been any issues with private health insurance providers being unable to offer the type of health insurance the visa requires? If so, what are those issues and what is the government doing to resolve those issues? If there are any problems: why did the government announce a new visa if it hasn't worked out all the kinks? Does the minister accept that members of migrant communities who have been made to wait almost two years with absolutely no end in sight may feel misled by the Turnbull government?</span>

                  <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  I'm pleased to address some of the questions which have been raised to me by various members. I thank them for the contributions which they have made. I will work through some of them, and in particular starting off with the member for Dunkley's point in relation to fostering integration in our community, particularly with some of the humanitarian intake that we have and some of the challenges which he has in the electorate of Dunkley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first point I'd make in relation to that is that overall we do exceptionally well at integrating migrants into Australia. In fact, we are the envy of the world in terms of attracting migrants, the processes which we have and how people integrate into the community. We welcome people from across the globe to our shores. In doing so, they integrate and we're all enriched in the process. Having said that, there are emerging challenges that we have to face up to, and we need to be honest in relation to those. We do have integration challenges in some particular areas. The Scanlon Foundation report, which is an excellent annual report and perhaps the best annual assessment of social cohesion in this country, did point out a few of the emerging challenges in its most recent report. It pointed out, for example, that it was concerned that there was an increasing geographic concentration of the overseas born in particular areas. It pointed out that there were concerns with the lack of English capability in particular areas, sometimes overlapping with those points as well. It also pointed out that there were concerns about racism that migrants were facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be aware of some of these things and we need policies to address them. Certainly, one of my firm objectives as the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs is to make integration a priority for us, because ultimately our successful multicultural model is built upon integration. It's not built upon assimilation, nor is it built upon separatism, which you sometimes see in Europe; it's built upon integration. We want to maintain that successful model.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the particular grants that the member referred to—the Fostering Integration Grants Scheme—will be good useful grants for his communities to be able to apply for. It's not a large grant—it's only $6 million—however, it will fund initiatives that the community puts forward to help them integrate into the broader community. We will be quite open about what type of projects they can put forward to be supported in that effort, but the core goal will be for integration into the broader community. I would encourage the member for Dunkley and other members in this chamber to tell their community groups to put forward applications when we announce the details.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the member for Blair has given me a couple of dozen questions in his remarks. The most substantial contribution which he made was in relation to the so-called privatisation of the visa system. There is of course nothing of the sort; it's just another misleading Labor lie which has been put forward.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TUDGE:</span>
                  </a>  I would like to address the question and not be interrupted by the member opposite as I am addressing his precise question. I would first of all point out that the government, in any decision we make and any process we go forward with, will continue to have responsibility for all visa decision-making, whether that be to grant or to refuse a visa to a non-citizen, and will always retain control and responsibility for who comes into Australia. We do have challenges with the visa processing system, in part because we have such rapid growth in the number of visa applications. The member for Blair may not be aware of this, but we have had nine million visa applications this year. The forecast is that that will grow to 13 million applications in a few years time. We want those to be processed efficiently and we want there to be good security underpinning that. So we would seek to utilise whatever capability was in the community to be able to do that. But I emphasise the core point that I started with: we will continue to have full responsibility for all visa decision-making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very briefly, the member raised an excellent point in relation to the CFMEU. We will continue to work on clamping down on the CFMEU.</span>

I asked him whether he actually watched Senate estimates and saw departmental officials talk about the privatisation that he proposes. Or does he not meet with departmental officials in relation to this issue? The workers are very concerned in relation to privatisation. What element of national security might be compromised by privatisation of the visa processing system? And why has the government put money aside in relation to those issues as well? The minister is not taking any notice of what the department has been saying. So what hidden agenda is there in terms of the privatisation of visa processing arrangements and when are you going to announce those? Can you ensure the 2,000 workers get support in terms of their jobs as well? The minister did not answer any questions I put in relation to the temporary parent arrangement. I would ask that minister to answer those questions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June last year, the government tried to change the rules around people acquiring Australian citizenship. Despite proposing some pretty far-reaching and fundamental changes to the basis on which people become Australian citizens, the government couldn't provide any evidence as to why the changes were necessary—none whatsoever. The community opposes this bill. Migrant communities uphill and down dale—from Melbourne, to Sydney, to Brisbane and all around the country—opposed it. It was struck off the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> by the government in October last year. Over 10,000 submissions were lodged with the inquiry that looked into the citizenship matter, and only two were in favour of the government's proposals—and one of those was from the government's own department. There were 10,000 submissions lodged.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, you talked about reintroducing that legislation, with lower English proficiency needed for applicants to pass the language test. Why hasn't the government provided any evidence, any basis, as to why it is necessary for their unfair citizenship changes to be brought forward? Why haven't you listen to Australians, who have overwhelmingly opposed the proposed changes? Why are you pandering to the hard right in this community, and in your own party, and creating uncertainty for people who want to join our national family?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">From March 2016 to April 2018, processing times for citizenship applications have increased from 12 months to 16 months. The department has confirmed this extension of waiting time for applicants and said it hired some staff to assist in processing applications. I dare say there is not a member in this place who wouldn't have experienced those delays in their own electorate. The department has also confirmed that complaints regarding citizenship applications have increased. Why won't the government commit the resources necessary to process these citizenship applications? The delays are causing distress and hurting people who have spent years in Australia studying, working, buying a house, raising children and committing themselves to the Australian family. Minister, why won't you let them commit themselves to a citizenship ceremony and do it now?</span>

I was briefly talking about the excellent submission that the member for Fisher was making in relation to the illegal behaviour of the CFMEU. He makes exceptionally strong points in relation to that. We heard from the jobs minister today in question time that the leader of the CFMEU, John Setka, has in fact been charged and found guilty of 59 offences, including five offences for assaulting a police officer. It's one of the reasons why we are determined to ensure that the ABCC stands in place, but it is also why, in relation to criminals generally in organised crime, we've made additional resources available in this budget alone. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr TUDGE:</span>
                  </a>  I've had to debate the member opposite, or, indeed, the member for Hotham up hill and down dale in relation to the English language. It is plain common sense that English is the national language and is the glue which binds us all together, because, if you can't communicate, it is very difficult do integrate. And so we do need to ensure that we have a common language so all of us can communicate together and we can maintain our successful multicultural model, which is fundamentally based on integration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also say that, of course, it's in the direct interest of a new migrant to learn English as quickly as possible, because the evidence clearly shows—and Professor McDonald from the University of Melbourne is perhaps the best authority on this—that, the better your English, the higher the likelihood is of you being in a job. If you've got good English, you're 3. 7 times more likely to be in employment than a person who has poor English. That of course applies to the humanitarian intake as well, which we want to encourage and support to lift their English up as well so they can have a better chance of being employed, because, frankly, at the moment, the employment outcomes from the humanitarian intake are not good enough for us. We all need to take responsibility in relation to that. But, if they have good English, their chances of being in the labour market are 85 per cent. If they have poor English, their chances of being in the labour market are 15 per cent. That's the importance of the English language to employment. That's the importance to social integration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, of course, English is vital for the operation of our democracy, because fundamentally our democracy is conducted in the English language. If someone is listening in to these debates today, they will not be able to understand the debates unless they have got at least a basic understanding of the English language.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I think it's a fairly straightforward proposition that the adoption of English language is a good thing for the individual, a good thing for social cohesion and a good thing for our democracy. The member for Dawson quite rightly points out that it's important for workplace health and safety these days as well—clearly something that the member opposite doesn't think is important these days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are determined to ensure that we will continue down that path, that we are consulting broadly, that we're listening closely and that we'll have sensible, reasonable propositions to put in place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  It's my pleasure to make a contribution to this debate and to welcome a new minister to the table in charge of the portfolio that covers the Australian Federal Police. I have to say I had some mixed feelings when the new minister was appointed. It's part of politics. When you have someone competent running a portfolio in which you're shadowing, it's good for the country because it's probably going to make better public policy, but it makes my job a little more difficult. I was a bit concerned because, I have to say, the previous minister in this portfolio—I think I can get some support from the member for Moreton here—is widely agreed to be the most incompetent minister in this government. So I was pretty happy, actually, when he moved out of that portfolio. I thought, 'Finally, we're going to have someone who actually knows what they're doing and is going to sit around the cabinet table and fight for the Australian Federal Police and fight for this organisation.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had such disappointment in seeing the forward appropriations for the Australian Federal Police because, instead of what I expected—which was having a new minister in charge and that we might see a different approach—what I saw was a continuation of the policy of cutting into this crucial organisation. Deputy Speaker, I'm not sure that you got the opportunity to see much of Senate estimates in the last couple of weeks, but what we saw there was actually terrible. The Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Andrew Colvin, confirmed that the current budget again cuts into the Australian Federal Police. We see a reduction of $205 million over the coming four years. Commissioner Colvin was able to identify some specific areas where he is going to see cuts to the organisation. He talked about the organisation's ability to tackle fraud, illicit drugs and guns as the areas that would be most affected. Deputy Speaker Howarth, I know these are areas that you're concerned about. I certainly am. The last thing I want to see is the Australian Federal Police lose funding to tackle these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, I know you'll also be concerned that the commissioner confirmed that staffing for the AFP is projected to be cut significantly over the coming four years. We would see cuts under the current budget from 6,448 personnel in 2018-19 to 5,881 personnel in 2021-22. That's a reduction of 567 AFP staff. This is an extraordinary cut. I want to make sure that we get these numbers on the record because I suspect I'm going to hear what I heard at the last appropriation discussion, and that was a minister arguing that the numbers in black and white in this budget are not what they seem to be. What I want to know from the minister is: how can he talk about his care for national security and all the important work the Australian Federal Police do while he's presiding over a $205 million cut to the organisation and a cut of 567 AFP staff?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my meetings with law enforcement, I hear constantly about the very significant challenges they face, from the rise in cybercrime and transnational crime to trafficking in people, drugs and guns. Estimates also confirmed for us—the AFP commissioner told estimates directly—that referrals of drug matters have risen by nearly 300 per cent in three years and that victim based crime matters have risen by 200 per cent. Our AFP officers do some incredibly important and incredibly dangerous work. It is a very significant thing they do, something I've never done in my life: they put on a uniform every day and put themselves in potentially incredibly dangerous situations to try to protect Australians. I'll have more to say about some indications in the budget that the staffing arrangements for this organisation have also been hacked into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've asked the minister a question already, but I'll continue that list. I'd like the minister to confirm that he heard the AFP commissioner's evidence in estimates that the AFP will lose $205 million over the forward estimates. Does the minister dispute the AFP commissioner's evidence that the AFP ASL—their staffing levels—is projected to fall by 567 personnel over the forward estimates? Does the minister dispute the AFP commissioner's evidence that the government has cut funding for the AFP employee benefits by $55 million over the forward estimates? Why should 500 AFP personnel lose their jobs because of funding cuts when the government has enough money to give away $60 billion to big business, including $17 billion to the banks? Which officers of the AFP will lose their jobs? Can the minister guarantee that, after this $205 million, no funding cuts will be progressed in the organisation? And how can Australians trust the Turnbull government to keep them safe when it prioritises big-business tax cuts over funding for the people who fight every day to protect us?</span>

That includes 190 Federal Police officers. One hundred and fifty of those are frontline officers; another 40 are providing intelligence and training support. Every Australian knows that, when they travel, they want the government ensuring that the aeroplanes and the airports they go to are safe and secure. That's why we're making this $284 million commitment.</span>

But the real test of national security—or anything, for that matter—is what you do when you are in government. And it's worthwhile going back and seeing what the Labor Party did when they were in government. Between 2010 and 2013, they cut $128 million per year, annualised funding, out of the Australian Federal Police. It gets worse: $30 million and 88 staff from the ACC between 2007 and 2013 and $27 million and 56 staff from AUSTRAC. And the worst is yet to come, because they cut $735 million and 700 staff from Customs. They left that organisation on its knees. The result of that was a 25 per cent reduction in sea cargo screening and a 75 per cent reduction in air cargo screening. You may as well roll out the red carpet to criminals when you are making those kinds of cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real test, as I say, is what you do when you're in government. We are absolutely committed to the national security of this country. The formation of Home Affairs, the biggest change in national security arrangements in the last 40 years in Australia, alongside the excellent work that I know the Attorney-General is doing in some of this area, is a very significant commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that comes the establishment of important new roles. Karl Kent has recently been appointed as the Transnational Serious and Organised Crime Coordinator. This allows us to take every part of the federal government's national security and intelligence capability and focus it on the criminals that we know are putting drugs on the streets in our towns—in my town of Goulburn and in many regional centres. We've seen a dramatic increase in the supply of methamphetamines and other drugs. We know that, as against even six or seven years ago, those drugs were being produced locally; now they're coming from offshore. That's why we need a Transnational Serious and Organised Crime Coordinator. We will always put Australia and Australians' national security as our first priority.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140590" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I thank the minister for his response, though I'd like to furnish a little bit more information for him, because he's confusing my view and my remarks with the view of the Australian Federal Police commissioner. I talked about some of the comments that were made in estimates, and he's attacked this as though it's a political argument. It's not; it's actually the testimony and the evidence given by the Australian Federal Police commissioner. The commissioner confirmed in estimates last week that the Australian Federal Police has lost $205 million. I would like to understand what the minister's response is to this concern. The AFP commissioner also confirmed that the AFP will have 567 fewer staff at the end of the forward estimates. I would like the minister to comment on that. This is not one politician arguing with another politician; it's actually testimony that was given by someone who runs this crucial organisation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to clarify some comments that were made about Labor's record. If there's one thing that the minister has said that I firmly agree with, it is that actions should match words. It is not enough to have conservative politicians in this country drape themselves in the Australian flag and talk about how concerned they are about these issues, and then toddle off down the road to the cabinet room and make a decision that's completely contrary to the things that they've said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to draw your attention, Deputy Speaker, to the facts in this matter. The facts is that the Australian Federal Police has never been better funded than it was under the former Labor government. That is an absolute fact. Deputy Speaker, I'd like also to draw your attention to the staffing of the Australian Federal Police. As you can imagine, they go hand in hand, because the biggest cost for the organisation is staffing. When Labor left office, there were more people working at the Australian Federal Police than there have been in any year since. I've got the numbers right in front of me here, taken from the annual reports of the Australian Federal Police. What I see before me are numbers which drop year after year after year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would like to know is how the minister can stand in this chamber and talk about his concern for these issues while at the same time cutting funding to the Australian Federal Police and doing things that will reduce staffing in this organisation. As the AFP commissioner has said—not politicians; the AFP commissioner—this will affect the organisation's ability to deal with drugs, with guns and with some of the crucial issues that face the security of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make mention of a very important issue that faces this organisation, which is the pay and conditions of the staff members of the Australian Federal Police. Last year, the Australian Federal Police voted for a new enterprise agreement, which the AFP has acknowledged will cost about $120 million to implement. We were delighted to see that agreement. It was due to the hard work of the Australian Federal Police Association over many years, and it was very timely because the organisation and its officers have not had a pay raise for quite a long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At estimates last week, the Australian Federal Police commissioner confirmed that, instead of an increase in the employee benefits, which would have to go alongside the sustaining of current staff and a pay rise, there is a $55 million cut to employee benefits earmarked over the forward estimates. The commissioner said in estimates that, if there is a shortfall in funding, as there appears to be in the budget—here I'm quoting his testimony—'the impact will be on our staff, as that is the largest part of our budget.' He went on, 'There will be attrition that we may not replace.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My questions to the minister with regard to this issue are as follows: does the minister dispute the AFP commissioner's evidence that the government has cut funding to AFP employee benefits by $55 million over the forward estimates? It's in black and white in the budget, and I'd like to hear the minister's response to deny something that is black and white in his budget. How can the AFP afford to implement a $120 million enterprise agreement when it has in its budget a cut for employee benefits of $55 million over the forward estimates? Can the minister guarantee that there will be no cuts to AFP employee pay and conditions? Can the minister guarantee there will be no further cuts to AFP funding beyond the 567 personnel the government is already cutting over the forward estimates? How many AFP officers will have to lose their jobs before the government stops cutting funding to the Australian Federal Police?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230485" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHRISTENSEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, for this chance to ask some questions of the minister. I listened very astutely to the answer he made before regarding the AFP. I noted the recollection of previous policies and cuts under the former Labor government—the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government—where they slashed funding to customs. I noted what the minister said about the fact that there's been somewhat of a shift from domestically produced drugs—crystal methamphetamine is one of those drugs that's rife throughout regional Australia, in particular—to the importation of drugs and/or substances used to produce those drugs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I still wonder to this day whether some of those decisions and cuts to Customs actually did ensure that the ball was dropped and that we had drugs coming in or material that went into the production of drugs that's led to this rampant disease almost of crystal methamphetamine, this epidemic throughout regional Australia because of their decisions. I and the minister are aware our communities up in North Queensland are ravaged by this drug, and the decisions that led to that were from the opposite side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I principally want to ask about natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. The minister would be well aware that early last year Cyclone Debbie crossed the coast and did a great deal of damage in the Whitsundays and Mackay local government areas. It did a great deal of damage down the coastline as well, even in other communities like Lismore in New South Wales. But, principally, we were ground zero for Cyclone Debbie up my way. In fact, the Insurance Council says it's the costliest cyclone event that has happened in Australia's history. I've got to say at the start, unfortunately, the reaction to the arrangements—the NDRRA scheme—weren't good on the ground, because the state government did something that was very deceitful, I think, and very underhanded in pumping up expectations that they knew could never be delivered. They put out a request for $110 million for things like $40 million for the Whitsunday Coast Airport. I would love to have $40 million for the Whitsunday Coast Airport, but the reality was, the Whitsunday Coast Airport, apart from a bit of the awning that was hanging off, wasn't damaged. It wasn't something that would have been eligible for funding under the NDRRA arrangements yet the state government led the local government on to say that they could apply for it. So there were things like that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Rockhampton, there was no damage to their flood levy but they wanted to do something extra with their flood levy. It wasn't part of this arrangement or it wasn't in the guidelines for the arrangements. So there's some concern there about what states are sort of telling local governments that they can get and the expectations. I think there's some clarity that's needed around that so that, when we go into another disaster, everyone knows who's funding what. I know the minister's made some changes in this space. They're changes which, I think, will be welcomed by local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know what happened. We went in, and we got a low amount of about $29 million that was offered by the federal government. I went in hard with the then minister and the local mayors and we got buffeted and increases up to almost $50 million in NDRRA funding for the region. That was very much welcome. To his department and to the previous minister, I would like to say thanks for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But my questions really do centre around two things: what support has been provided to states and territories in response to disasters since July 2017? And the fact that there's been quite a number of floods, cyclones and fires that have impacted communities across the country since July 2017, I want to know what work the minister is doing to help increase the resilience of communities to such disasters. It is very important, Minister, that we do have adequate funding, adequate knowledge about what the NDRRA program is going to deliver. The changes, I think, are going to be very welcome but I would like to hear now what those changes will be and how we are increasing the resilience of those communities.</span>

Sadly, this is an all-too-common occurrence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased, Attorney-General, to see the announcement that we made today to seek to improve the structure of the court for the benefit of Australians right across this country, importantly, for Australian families who are going through a very difficult time of their lives. Importantly, the announcement today builds on the funding and investment we have made into this system over the past few years. As we see this new appeals process and this new court structure, I think we can hope that we see a vast improvement in the time taken to process the cases of people in these very difficult circumstances. A constituent I was speaking with at the weekend at the Coomera Anglican College fair relayed to me that it's been nearly three years of going through this court process with the family breakdown and separation. He has become enormously frustrated with the time, the paperwork and the cost it has taken to get to a point where the matter is resolved so he and his children and his family can move on with their lives. This is where I see that the reforms that were announced today will significantly assist people in those very difficult circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this is in conjunction with work that's being done by the Australian Law Reform Commission more generally on how we improve the systems and processes to ensure that the opportunity is there for people in these circumstances to have their matters dealt with in a way that provides justice for all concerned in a manner that is cost-effective, because we know that one of the things that put enormous pressures on families in these circumstances is the financial pressure and the cost of dealing with the legal system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My question to the minister is: how will families, including those in the electorate of Forde, benefit from the changes that have been announced today? Also, more importantly, how will the investment that we have consistently sought to make into the Family Court system ensure that the system is robust, well funded and efficient so that families in these very difficult circumstances get the justice and the resolution they need so they can move on with their lives?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:23</span>):  As you know, one of the important issues in family law is family violence. Former Chief Justice Diana Bryant has said that family violence features in 41 per cent of contested cases in family law. One of the measures that I think both the coalition government and the Labor opposition believe need immediate attention is cross-examination law reform to prevent the revictimisation and retraumatisation of victims through the means of cross-examination by their abusive former partner. The government released an exposure draft bill in respect of cross-examination reform last year. Submissions closed on Friday, 25 August 2017. I ask the minister: what progress has been made in respect of the exposure draft and when we can expect to see cross-examination law reform occur in this country?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the proposal in the exposure draft, as you know, there was a lack of clarity as to who might do the cross-examining on behalf of the alleged former abuser. As you would also be aware, Labor has previously committed more than $40 million to ensure that, in circumstances where an alleged abuser is prevented from cross-examining their former partner, both parties are legally represented. There are obvious reasons for that, which go to both natural justice and ensuring neither is disadvantaged by the refusal of the ability to cross-examine personally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the proposal to have a court-appointed person ask questions on behalf of unrepresented litigants subjected to a cross-examination ban, what qualifications would the court-appointed person be required to have? What restrictions would be imposed upon the court's power to appoint such persons? What ethical obligations would apply to such court-appointed persons? Will a court-appointed person be under any duty to the court? Will the court-appointed person be under any duty to the person on whose behalf they are asking questions? Will the court-appointed person be under any duty to any other party or any other person in connection with the proceedings? Will the person under the cross-examination ban have any say in who the court-appointed person is? Will the court-appointed person be paid and, if so, how will that pay be set? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has announced today a range of reforms in respect of the merging of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. These administrative arrangements, of course, will be important changes. I will await the detail of them before I will make any comment, but I have said today that this falls short of addressing family violence in the family law system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is very important is the judicial resourcing and the system of judicial appointments. These questions are very important because they go to the workload of judges. The workload of judges, in turn, affects how much reliance has to be placed on, for example, family report writers. Accordingly, I'd ask the minister to describe how he will ensure that there are sufficient judges to ensure that judges have appropriate workloads to prevent them from being in a position where they're unable to manage those workloads. Will the government also consider ensuring gender balance in the judiciary in the new court? And will the government take into account experience in both family law and family violence in appointing future judges to the court once it has been amalgamated? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has received a unanimous report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. That report made a number of recommendations to the government on a unanimous basis. Some of those recommendations went to the question of family report writing. Obviously, the government has committed some additional funding to appointing additional family consultants to the court. However, there are concerns about family report writing. What will the government do to ensure the quality of family report writing? Will the government introduce a complaints mechanism in respect of family report writers? What will the government do to ensure the professionalisation and ongoing regulation of family report writing? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should also explain—and I ask the minister to explain—why the court's family violence work plan, which expired in 2016, has yet to be replaced. I would also ask the minister to advise what is being done to ensure the family violence best practice principles of the family law courts are kept up to date and are continually informed by best practice and leading evidence in respect of the causes of family violence. Specifically, will the minister commit to ensuring that the family violence best practice principles of the courts are subjected to some consultation, including with the Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HK5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  I'd like to take this opportunity of raising with the Attorney-General issues in relation to older Australians and, in particular, the provision of care for older Australians who find themselves in necessitous circumstances. As we know, the population is ageing in Australia. It's ageing rapidly. When the great baby boomer generation—of which I suspect most people in this room are part—'not quite', says my honourable friend here——moves into older age, then that's going to have a significant number of challenges for society generally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I particularly wanted to raise is the question of elder abuse. As I understand it, Mr Attorney, there are no accurate figures in Australia as to the prevalence of elder abuse. But studies in the UK and Canada have found that somewhere between two per cent and eight per cent of people aged over 65 experience some form of abuse in any one year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That abuse can come in a variety of forms. Obviously, financial abuse is one form in which there can be serious consequences. Having spent some time at the bar in the past, as my friend has—and also as an associate—and having seen the willingness, if I can put it that way, with which some families fight over the wills of their parents, I can understand that financial elder abuse is likely to be more prevalent than we expect in the community generally. In addition to financial abuse, there is psychological abuse. From time to time one hears worrying stories—anecdotal, of course—in relation to the psychological and mental abuse of elderly people by members of family and extended family. And then there is the physical abuse of older relatives—parents, regrettably, sadly, in some circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A combination of these factors—financial abuse, psychological abuse and physical abuse—in relation to an ageing population is something I think all members of this parliament would have concerns about. I note that, as part of the More Choices for a Longer Life package, the government will provide an additional $22 million to tackle elder abuse out to the year 2021-22. In that context, I will ask the Attorney a number of questions. Firstly, can the Attorney explain how that additional $22 million in the 2018 budget will tackle elder abuse. How will that be spent and how will we measure that, given the lack of prevalence studies in this country? Secondly, how does this align with previous announcements that the government has made to tackle elder abuse? Thirdly, what progress has been made on developing a national plan on elder abuse? We have a variety of national plans relating to, for example, domestic violence and suicide prevention. The development of a national plan which involves the Commonwealth, the states and territories would seem to be desirable given the ageing of the population. Fourthly, I understand that the government has set aside funding to develop a national register of enduring powers of attorney. Perhaps the Attorney could explain the benefits of this proposal. Enduring powers of attorney give power to family members or other close friends of the particular individual and extend not only to financial matters; in all states now there are enduring powers of attorney that go to medical decisions as well. Finally, I understand that the national register is subject to the states agreeing to reform their power of attorney laws and documentation. I, and I am sure many honourable members, would be interested to know what progress has been made with the states. If, as Edmund Burke once famously said, society is a compact across generations then care for the older generations is something the younger generations should always bear in mind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  This morning the Attorney-General announced the demise of the Family Court of Australia. It is a very sad day for family law in Australia. This was a specialist court, established in 1975, which for over 40 years has been at the forefront of family law development internationally. It is been copied in many overseas jurisdictions as being of best practice. Obviously, Labor will always support sensible family law reform at a time when our family law courts are in crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the Australian Law Reform Commission, led by the eminently qualified Professor Helen Rhoades, is currently undertaking a comprehensive review into our family law system. But rather than waiting for that report this arrogant government, with no recommendations of the ALRC, with no consultation at all, is bulldozing the Family Court of Australia. While the states are actually moving to create more specialist courts to deal with the difficult and sensitive cases involving family law violence, as mentioned by the member for Griffith, this government is taking the retrograde step of returning to a generalised court system. There will no longer be a specialist court for family law in Australia. The new Porter court will hear family and general federal law matters. The former Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Alastair Nicholson, in a paper delivered at the International Society of Family Law 10th world conference said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… experience in Australia and overseas suggests that where a family court is a division of a generalist court, or where family law cases are simply assigned to judges or magistrates in a generalist court, the quality of performance suffers greatly </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, these Porter changes will fundamentally affect the decisions made on behalf of vulnerable families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government has been in office five years, and what have they done for our family law system during this time? We know first up that they tried to increase the fees that families pay to access family courts at a time when they are most vulnerable. Labor fought the divorce tax tooth and nail. In fact, Senator Moore and I personally took the former Attorney-General, Bookshelves Brandis, to court when he tried for a second time to increase fees after the Senate had disallowed his first attempt. The coalition government tries to pretend it cares about family law, but their actions speak louder than their cheap words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Calls by judges, legal practitioners, frontline service providers and families for better resources in the family courts have instead gone unanswered. The coalition government has consistently failed to replace judges in a timely manner, despite their positions being funded. When I spoke in consideration in detail one year ago, there were then five judicial vacancies in the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court. It took more than a year to replace a Brisbane Family Court judge. This inexcusable laziness exacerbates the delays. On the coalition's watch the court backlog has snowballed out of control and obviously it always causes further suffering to families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is very convenient for the Attorney-General, the first law officer, to blame the judges, it is he and his predecessor who must accept the blame for the family law system being in crisis. A good Attorney-General would always defend the integrity of the judiciary. A good Attorney-General would defend the integrity of the Family Court. A good Attorney-General would defend the rule of law. That is what a good and competent Attorney-General would do. Sadly, this Attorney-General is merely playing politics with the Family Court of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we have a look at the data and the evidence and count families not as mere numbers, we cannot possibly do justice to the complex issues that confront their lives. So I ask the Attorney-General: has he sat as an observer in the Family Court of Australia for a day or half a day? If he did, he would have a better understanding of the complexities of the cases being heard by judges of the Family Court. Sadly, this Attorney-General only seems to take his policy cues from Pauline Hanson's One Nation political party, just like his predecessor, Senator Brandis, when he proposed parenting management hearings, which were once a One Nation political party policy, Attorney-General Porter is abolishing the Family Court exactly as Senator Pauline Hanson, President for Life, ordered. It's horse trading with vulnerable families. This government should be utterly ashamed of itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask if Senator Hanson has any other demands about Family Law that she has delivered to the Attorney-General. I also ask about filing fees and court event fees. They're not uniform in the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court. As these courts will be merged, will any of the current fees of either court be increased? Is the divorce tax coming back? The <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> has quoted a PwC report. Can you confirm the number of cases finalised by the Federal Circuit Court judges that include consent orders? Who will decide which division a particular matter will be heard in? Will it be a court official or will it be the citizen?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PORTER:</span>
                  </a>  Sorry; and the member for Forde. It was such a long time ago. It was a very memorable contribution too, member! But the level of funding that exists in the court has been raised here by both the member for Moreton and the member for Griffith. I might run through a bit of the context of this because it's undeniable that, as I have expressed today in a range of media outings, the backlog has been increasing and, additionally, the time to final resolution has been increasing. For instance, it has gone to 17 months in the Family Court of Australia from about 11 months, and that is obviously not in the best interests of clients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tying that back directly to a proposition that the courts have been underfunded has to be understood fairly and in context. Have a look at the 2017-18 budget and the budget that preceded that in 2015-16, and keep in mind that this budget allocates $4 million to this project of consolidating the two courts into what will be the new FCFCA. In the 2017-18 budget, there was $10.7 million allocated over four years to family law courts to engage additional family consultants to assist in complex parenting matters, which include matters where violence has been experienced in the family law context. Also in that 2017-18 budget, $12.7 million was allocated over four years to establish the parenting management hearings—and that's been the subject of a committee report, which I'm responding to very shortly. Additional funding of $14 million over three years was also provided from the Public Service Modernisation Fund to digitise the court processes in all of the federal courts, including the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court. That has been a very important part of the project of modernisation of the two courts that deal with family law. They're very significant matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Preceding those, in the 2015-16 budget, was a funding injection of $22.5 million over four years, which is an effective rebasing of the courts. My understanding is that that was, in discussion with the courts, allowed to be spent in a way that represented the court's best judgement and exercise of discretion as to how they could get the best value out of the expenditure of that not inconsiderable $22.5 million over four years. Ultimately, the decision was not to reinvest that into further judicial officers over that period but to expend it in other areas to help them deal with the filings that they were receiving at that period of time and were to receive over the years. It's also notable that an efficiency dividend relief for judges' salaries was provided, which was an exemption from a savings measure, but that was worth $13 million. It's also important to note that administrative arrangements, including the merging of the corporate services of all three of the federal courts, including the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court, were funded in the 2015-16 budget, and that delivered administrative savings of $9.4 million over six years out to 2020-2021 and $5.4 million annually thereafter. All of those savings, which were real line item administrative savings the court experienced, were able to be reinvested by the courts to enhance their capacity to provide services in family law. There's also been $30 million of funding for the critical maintenance of court buildings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point that I want to make is that, where funding has gone to the courts in the last three budgets, it's not been inconsiderable funding by any stretch. The notion that the problems that have been experienced by the courts is simply going to be solved by adding new judicial officers—whether they be Federal Circuit Court judicial officers or judges in the Family Court of Australia—into the existing system is a gross oversimplification of the problems that have been exercised. When we have interfaced with the courts and provided very substantial funding, their stated preference in expenditure has been for matters which are ancillary to judicial officers and which allow for the management of cases in a way which very often is non-litigious. A good example, Member for Griffith, is for those family law courts to engage family law consultants, which was $10.7 million. This idea that more judicial officers layered on the existing system is the answer is not one that we accept. I think that you will see from that brief summary that there has been very substantial additional funding going to the courts. In fact, the $4 million that is applied in this budget to allow this project to occur is to allow for the full rewriting of the rules. That will obviously occur in accordance with and in consideration of the ALRC's report.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  We're in the middle of a financial services royal commission. It's hard to miss. For every day the royal commission is in session we hear more evidence about the terrible misconduct and potential criminal activity on the part of the banks. Just this week, we heard about Bankwest unilaterally changing loan conditions for customers, including drastically downgrading valuations of properties after an initial loan was granted, sending owners to the wall. The commission is only getting warmed up. It is due to report in December, and we will doubtless hear much more evidence in this vein. It's a royal commission, I would remind the Attorney-General, which the government resisted for years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say that the royal commission is hard to miss, but the government appears not to have been watching, because last week we discovered that, in the middle of the royal commission, this government has chosen to end funding for the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce. That's right: the government has ended the coalition of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Attorney-General's Department, among others, just when we might need it the most. It shows the level of commitment from this government to truly tackle corporate misdemeanour and crime. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to this royal commission. The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services refused to apologise for the delay. They are cutting $26 million from ASIC and now they are completely abolishing the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce. Unlike this government, Labor believe that corporate criminals must be brought to justice, and we want the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions properly resourced to do just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd have to say that the current Attorney-General is particularly well placed to understand the need for resources in directors of public prosecution. He worked for the WA DPP and would know how important resources are, not just to state DPPs but to Commonwealth DPPs as well. You don't need me to tell you that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is a financial minnow compared to the big banks with their deep pockets. It's so far from a level playing field that it doesn't even deserve the title. We still believe that we can do something to shift the balance. That's why the Leader of the Opposition announced a $25 million boost to the Commonwealth Director of Prosecutions in his budget reply speech. I couldn't be prouder of that commitment if we are elected to government at the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there are recommendations to come for prosecutions from the banking royal commission—and it looks like there might be—we want the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to be able to take them on. We want the Commonwealth DPP to be able to take them on and continue with them unafraid that the DPP will be deep-pocketed, as the expression goes, by those who the Commonwealth believes should be prosecuted. Anything less than that would make a joke of the royal commission process and would be an insult to those who have given evidence at the commission and those who we expect to continue to give evidence in coming months. The revelations of the banking royal commission cannot go unanswered. Proper enforcement of our Corporations Law is essential if we are to restore a sense of confidence and trust in the financial system, because, of course, that is one of the primary purposes of this banking royal commission that we called for for so long. It is absolutely vital that when, as we expect, the banking royal commission makes recommendations that some people who have appeared before the royal commission—some people whose crimes, or alleged crimes, have been uncovered—be prosecuted, we can have absolute confidence that the Commonwealth DPP is adequately resourced to carry forward those prosecutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would ask the Attorney-General: why does the government deem it appropriate to abolish the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce in the middle of the banking royal commission? What guarantee can the government give that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will be adequately resourced to handle any referrals for prosecution that stem from the banking royal commission? And what will the government do to increase the rate of successful prosecutions of corporate crime and ensure that the current situation that we have seen and that we continue to see unfolding will never happen again?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="208884" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PORTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  I thank the member for Isaacs for his contribution. It is true that few people have greater empathy for the hard work of DPPs around the country and the CDPP in particular. I recall very distinctly moving from a corporate national law firm to the state DPP and all of the glamour of boardroom drinks on a Friday afternoon disappeared. At the DPP, there was a small green tin that you would put loose change in to buy yourself a light beer on a Friday afternoon. So I completely appreciate that the leanness with which these organisations operate is highly admirable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were two issues, in effect, raised by the member for Isaacs and they are separate. One of them falls within the portfolio of the Assistant Treasurer, but, for the sake of completeness, I'll attempt to address both of them. One was with respect to the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce and the other was with respect to the efficiency dividend that has been allocated to the CDPP, as it has been, at 0.5 per cent of the budget of a range of other agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio. The four-year saving for the efficiency dividend is $1.8 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce, it is the case that in July 2015 the government announced $127.6 million to establish the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce. That was money allocated through the assistant Treasurer's portfolio. The work of that taskforce has been very important and very successful. There was always an end time to that particular funding. As was noted by Minister O'Dwyer in parliament in question time, of course the consideration of what might replace that when it ends and how that might occur is going to be a matter for the usual course of budgetary consideration in the usual cycles. But it is self-evident that close consideration will be given to the necessity to look at how that funding is dealt with when it ceases, as it was always meant to do, and what will come next, because there is a very important matter before us, insofar as the royal commission recommendations will be in the not-too-distant future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might note that that task force—which was an allocation by this government of $127.6 million—didn't exist under the previous government. Money wasn't allocated under the previous government. That task force, which is a joint task force including the CDPP, has successfully recovered $200 million for the community to date, which is a very successful and important operation. Of course, that will be taken into account in the budget cycle when the funding ends and the next tranches of funding are considered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth DPP in this particular budget was also allocated an additional $5.3 million over two years to prosecute cases arising from the new and enhanced Australian Taxation Office enforcement of the black economy and $0.8 million over three years to prosecute cases relating to illicit tobacco. Just like the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce, specific boosts in funding for specific task forces designed to track, trace and prosecute specific types of offending are always time bound, as are the $5.3 million and the $0.8 million that I've just mentioned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That then takes me to the 0.5 per cent efficiency dividend, which at the CDPP will mean that in 2017-18 a saving needs to be found of $200,000 and then $400,000, $400,000, $400,000 and $400,000, a $1.8 million saving cumulatively out to 2021-22. Many agencies have that type of efficiency dividend put on them, even lean agencies like the CDPP. It is a fair discipline to have these agencies look internally for savings. Most of my agencies—and I consulted with them all about their ability to meet that efficiency dividend without disrupting frontline services—assured me that that was eminently possible and achievable. Indeed, most of them identified supplier practices, supplier expenses and procurement practices as where savings would be garnered from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just note for the benefit of the member for Isaacs that that is, as I've noted, $1.8 million in savings through an efficiency dividend. When you look at the last Labor budget, which the member for Isaacs might recall because he was the Attorney-General, I think, shortly after that budget was delivered, there was a measure titled 'targeted savings, public servants efficiencies' that saved—would you believe it?—$1.8 million from the CDPP's budget over the relevant period. So it's a usual budgetary discipline of government and one that both of us have engaged in I think quite appropriately.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I ask the Attorney-General to cast his mind back to the shadow Attorney-General's questions. He did not seem to answer the shadow Attorney-General's question as to why the government deemed it appropriate to abolish the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce in the middle of the banking royal commission. Attorney-General, why is it being abolished? Do you support the time frame for the abolition, given that the nation is absolutely concerned and aghast at the revelations coming out of the banking royal commission?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney-General, could I also draw your attention to the questions that I asked you. I appreciate the response that you gave on a question I didn't ask you, but, in terms of the questions that I did ask you, what is being done with cross-examination law reform? Where is the government up to with cross-examination law reform? Specifically, what quality assurance will there be in respect of the person who is to be asking the questions on behalf of the alleged abusive former partner?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, what is going to be done, if anything, to ensure gender equality amongst the judiciary for the new amalgamated court?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, what will be done to ensure that newly appointed judges have family law experience? What will be done to ensure that they have experience and expertise in respect of family violence, specifically?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney-General, could you also consider the question that I asked you about the recommendations in the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee report in respect of family report writers? To give you some context as to my particular interest in this, as you know, I have some portfolio interest in family violence. On Friday, in my electorate, with the Hon. Di Farmer MP, the Minister for the Prevention of Domestic and Family Violence in the Palaszczuk government, and Councillor Kara Cook, who is not only our local councillor but the person who set up Australia's first domestic violence law firm as its principal, we held the domestic violence forum. A local came along and told us some horror stories about her experience with family law, all of which you would of course be familiar with, as the Attorney-General. One of the issues she squarely raised was her very poor experience with family report writers. I ask you again: what will be done in respect of the quality of family report writers, the regulation of family report writers, the creation of a complaints mechanism in respect of family report writers and the ongoing professional development of family report writers to ensure that they are up-to-date on current thinking in respect of family violence and its root causes?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney-General, I also refer you to my question about the courts' family violence work plan. As you would be aware, the most recent family violence work plan in the family law courts expired in 2016. It's now 2018. I am sure you would agree, Attorney-General, that family violence remains a significant concern not just for the courts but for this nation. We are midway through the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022. We have a situation where there is still a high prevalence of family violence and a high prevalence of family violence amongst contested cases in the family law courts. It is the case, I expect you would agree, that it is important for the family law courts—that includes the new amalgamated entity, once it comes into existence—to continue to proactively improve procedures and responses to family violence in respect of the litigants that appear before them. Attorney-General, will there be another family violence action plan to replace the action plan that expired in 2016? What's the progress, if any, that's been made in respect of preparing a further family violence action plan?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney-General, I also asked you about the <span style="font-style:italic;">Family violence best practice principles</span>, which is a document created by the courts, as you are aware. I asked you what is being done to ensure that that document also reflects the evidence base and best practice thinking in respect of family violence. We have in this country Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety, of which you are well aware, having formerly been the social services minister. That entity, ANROWS, was established under the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022. It is the entity that is creating an evidence base, as is envisaged under the national plan, in respect of how we can best respond to family violence. What is being done to ensure that that organisation, the evidence base it's creating and the guidance it can provide are being consulted and incorporated into future family violence work in the family law courts? I'm sure you would agree that it is very important that the courts take onboard current thinking, emerging practice and emerging evidence in respect of the proper responses to family violence and understanding its causes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Attorney-General, can I ask you to consider the questions that were previously asked and unanswered, and consider providing answers to them in your next response?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PORTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  I thank the member for Griffith. I share your concern in these matters. You speak very quickly, but I will try to get through as many of the matters you have raised as I can. Let me say to you that previously, as a prosecutor over a number of years, I would have at trial completed and at sentencing dealt with literally hundreds of matters of family and sexual violence against women and children. I understand all of the complexities and I share, I think, your concerns about how we can best improve our practices inside courts and in other agencies of government to deal with these things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation to deal with reform as to the cross-examination of witnesses in the Family Court—you listed off a range of matters, and I won't deal with each individually here, but they were the subject of debate in respect of the original draft—I'm working through and close to completion on. I expect to have that legislation back in parliament in these winter sittings. That is imminent. I am well aware of each of those matters, and of course  all of the matters that you raised represent often a very delicate balancing exercise between the appropriate protection of victims and the establishment and maintenance of proper procedural fairness. I'm live to them all, and that legislation is imminent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the gender balance on the new courts: immediately, the gender balance will effectively be as it is at present, because all of the existing judges on the Family Court will move to Division 1 and the Federal Circuit Court to Division 2. The usual procedures will be followed as between the Attorney-General and heads of jurisdiction for cabinet appointments when vacancies arise. I think that if you've seen my track record as a state Attorney-General in appointing with a great eye to a gender balance—that will be still the case. We will strive to achieve as good a balance as we possibly can, keeping in mind, of course, that in dealings with the heads of jurisdiction merit is always the first criterion in all of these matters. That is not to suggest that merit falls disproportionately on either of the genders, but I will a close eye on the gender balance of the new court as positions arise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the family violence work plan that expired in 2016, my information from my departmental advisers is that that is, in essence, a court document. So I will have to take that on notice and return to you with where the court is at with respect to the refreshing, redrafting and republication of that document. I would expect it's something that they're paying due attention to, but I just don't have that information to my fingertips at the moment, and I will endeavour to get that for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the future appointment of personnel—both onto the Federal Court, which of course would, under the proposition, hear appeals from the new FCFCA, and then, as judges retire from the newly created FCFCA, how we would appoint to ensure that there's adequate and appropriate family law and family violence experience—the two comments I'd make there are that the Federal Court is a court of, obviously, superior record of impeccable international reputation. It has some judicial officers that you might describe as specialists in areas such as industrial law and commercial law. Many of the impeccably qualified judicial officers on the Federal Court are generalists—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PORTER:</span>
                  </a>  But the point I would make is that, no doubt, as we go forward with the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, if, as is the case under this plan, they ever have a jurisdiction for hearing family law appeals they will be looking to buttress their family law expertise. There is already a great deal of expertise on the court amongst generalists but very, very highly skilled practitioners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the new court, what I would note is that in the drafting process we'll obviously consider ways in which we draft to ensure that that is part of the legislation. I'd also note that 85 per cent of all family law matters now are heard by the Federal Circuit Court, and over the years since its creation they have been of increasing complexity. I accept absolutely the notion and the reality that matters that go to the Family Court judges, vis-a-vis the Federal Circuit Court judges, are somewhat more complicated, but the measure of complication, as even the heads of jurisdiction agree, is incredibly shallow. It's basically a four-day protocol: will trials last more or less than four days? A two-day trial that involves sexual violence or a history of family violence may well be far more complicated than a five-day trial that involves essentially property matters. So part of this is developing with the $4 million we've allocated a very proper triage and assessment system to determine those types of complexity matters at first instance.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Environment and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  It's a great pleasure to be here with my parliamentary colleague the Hon. Melissa Price to talk about the importance of the actions that we're taking in the Environment and Energy portfolio. As you know, for the first time, these two portfolios have been integrated in order to not only tackle the very thorny and difficult issue of climate and energy policy but also to continue to deliver good outcomes for our environment. What's important in this budget is that we are investing in our energy future. There is money to follow through on the Finkel review recommendations. There is money to create a consumer access data platform to ensure people get better deals from their retailers, to continue the work of the COAG Energy Council, to ensure that we have a robust fuel security system—we're conducting a significant review in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the environment, there is a huge amount of money—the largest ever single investment—in the Great Barrier Reef, in the restoration and management of this great wonder of the world. It is more than 2,000 kilometres in length, larger than the size of Italy and Japan. It is absolutely vital that we tackle the issues related to water quality, to better management practices by the farmers to avoid pesticide, nitrogen, and sediment run-off, to tackle the crown-of-thorns starfish, to invest in the science so that we create more heat-resistant and light-resistant coral to withstand some of the challenges that the Great Barrier Reef is going through right now. That amount of money, which is over half a billion dollars, has been warmly received by the science community, by the tourism community, by the farmers and by all those with a vested interest in the future health of the reef.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also more money in this budget for our Antarctic Science Program, which is internationally regarded. There's money to improve the Bureau of Meteorology's information communications and technology system, bearing in mind how central the bureau is to our defence, to our transport infrastructure, to our agriculture sectors and, indeed, to the broader community. And there's more money for heritage protection and for a new flagship national heritage program which will promote our amazing Indigenous sites as well as other sites throughout the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget sees more money put into the environment and more money put into energy policy. When it comes to energy policy, the National Energy Guarantee will be absolutely critical to delivering lower power prices and a more reliable system, as well as to meeting our international emissions reduction targets under the Paris agreement. Emissions today are, on a per-capita and GDP basis, at the lowest level in 28 years. When the Labor Party were last in office, they were expected to miss the 2020 target by over 700 million tonnes. We came into government and not only did we abolish the carbon tax, which saw the biggest single reduction in electricity prices ever on record, but we've actually turned around our 2020 target, and now we're expected to beat it by significantly more than 200 million tonnes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other work that we've done is intervene in the gas market to see more gas provided for domestic customers rather than exported overseas. Again, the Labor Party ignored the warnings from AEMO and from their own energy white paper which, as a result, saw gas prices go up quite dramatically. We've intervened, and the ACCC said prices have come down by up to 50 per cent. Labor did nothing about the networks, the poles and the wires, which are up to 50 per cent of people's power bills. We've abolished the limited merits review which, if the Labor Party had done it, would have saved consumers $6.5 billion. Whether it's the National Energy Guarantee, whether it is Snowy 2.0 and investments in storage, whether it is a better deal for customers from their retailers or whether it is abolishing the limited merits review or getting more gas into the domestic market, we're delivering a more affordable, reliable, and cleaner energy future, as well as significant investments in our environment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  It's interesting to hear you, Minister, talking about the portfolio and the combination of environment and energy. Clearly, it's a challenge to give appropriate weighting to the environment side of that portfolio. You talked recently about how Australia has one of the richest and most complex ecosystems in the world. That's very true. In my own electorate, which is World Heritage listed, we have unique flora and fauna—including koalas and platypuses—and we have a New South Wales government that wants to put a road through them. I think that really goes to the question of how much protection those areas get in this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've also acknowledged climate change as one of the threats to the 150,000 different species that we have, yet I note there was no new funding for climate change in the budget. There was nothing specific for it. You didn't have to blink and you'd miss it; it just wasn't there. I think that's disappointing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like the minister to explain the reports that there's a 25 per cent cut to the biodiversity and conservation division of the Department of Environment budget for the coming financial year. That's reported. I'd like to know if that report is accurate. I'd like to know what is the exact size of the cut? This cut's also reported to result in a loss of 60 full-time equivalent staff positions. I want to make the point that that's 60 out of a total base of approximately 200 full-time equivalent staff. So we're talking a cut of a third of staff. It does seem to me that you need people on the ground for the protection of the environment that you talk about, to protect these endangered species—in fact, to protect species not endangered so we can ensure that they remain healthy. So can the minister explain how the department will manage with a cut this size? I've heard these cuts described as 'kneecapping', as 'an absolute calamity for the Australian environment'—</span>

                    </a>  That's how it's been described. We already have one of the highest rates of extinction. It all comes at a time when we've had the largest step backwards in conservation history with the removal of the Coral Sea as a marine park. In fact, there has been more area taken from conservation areas than in any country ever. So that's why I'm interested in these cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first national review of threatened species monitoring has found that one-third of the 548 endangered species and 70 per cent of our threatened ecological communities were not being tracked at all. It has been reported that the poor performance has been driven by factors likely to be exacerbated by these job cuts. It worries me that that isn't a priority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same, of course, could be said for the heritage division of the department, because over the years they haven't been a priority. I note that, in your five minutes of speaking, you spent about 10 seconds talking about heritage. That seems to me indicative of the priority that it has. The minister knows my interest in Thompson Square in Windsor, and I note that the minister took the step of writing to the premier of New South Wales. Yet what worries me in his analysis of Thompson Square and the decision not to emergency-list it nationally is that no-one from the department of heritage went on that site. This site has the oldest brick-barrel drains in the country, convict-made brick-barrel drains. No-one from the heritage department has even been there. What does that say about the funding that has gone to the department in order to adequately protect not just colonial history but also Indigenous history? I think that does raise questions, and I'd like to hear the minister's view on the funding for the heritage department—not for the money that you're offering people, but for the resourcing that you have within that department to adequately assess things, by going on site, on the ground, and really looking at what constitutes national heritage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also be interested to know how the government plans to maintain the biodiversity that it so clearly values, and the welfare of Australia's vulnerable native wildlife when it's cutting staff and resources from the divisions responsible for tracking these threatened species. How many threatened species are awaiting the development of recovery plans? How does this number compare to the number of threatened species awaiting recovery plans five years ago? What is the department going to do to monitor the effectiveness of recovering threatened species, and how do they know when a species has recovered? I'd really appreciate answers to those questions.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  I rise this evening to, first of all, express my great appreciation to the minister for the recent close to half-billion-dollar investment in the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, my electorate from Cairns up to the Torres Strait actually takes a very considerable area of the reef. I'm pleased to see that we are continuing to invest in what has been world-class management. It really annoys me when I hear arguments in the media—it's inevitably in the southern based media—where they're talking about saving the reef. When you think about this, you see it's absolute nonsense. It is actually designed to prompt those in metropolitan areas who know absolutely nothing about the issue to open up their chequebooks, to be a fundraiser to these particular organisations. I think that it does a huge amount of damage in our area, particularly in relation to our tourism industry. The reef tourism operators in many ways are part of the custodians of the reef.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just noted the previous speaker's comment in relation to the Coral Sea. Let me assure you that the best way to totally destroy an ecosystem is just to kick everybody out, lock it up, and think the lockup mentality is the best management tool. I'm just telling you now that a lockup mentality is not good management. These areas need to be utilised. There's a thing called sustainability. And, provided that that is followed, whether it be through extractive industries like fishing or whether it be through recreational use, that has to be the key criteria. And the management that we're seeing happening up there at the moment in this beautiful area is, I think, a credit to Australia in that we are leading the world in reef management. And we're not 'saving' the reef. The reef doesn't need to be saved. It needs to continue to be managed and to make sure that we have best practices there to make sure that anything we do on there is sustainable and, when there are issues confronting the reef—we talk about the recent bleaching. I understand the bleaching. The bleaching is an event caused from hot currents that come from South America. I can assure you that, by destroying our own industries along the eastern seaboard, that's not going to stop those warm currents coming across from South America. What's going to help to influence those is what they do in China, what they do in India and what they do in the United States. That's what's going to make the big difference there to get those changes that will have an impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, we have to do best-possible practice. I've got to say that, again, we had that $2 billion that we announced earlier on and now another half a billion dollars, and some of the work we're doing there, particularly in relation to inflows into the agricultural sector, have made some very significant inroads. But one of the things I'd like to see and I'd encourage you to consider, Minister, is something like a Clean Seas program mark II, where we start to look at outflows from all our coastal cities. That will help to complement the work to make sure we deal with those issues as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say to you: congratulations on the efforts to date. We'll continue to maintain our status in that area. I'd like to ask the minister to explain how, given our record in Great Barrier Reef investments, those investments will benefit my electorate of Leichhardt. I know that there are many benefits, but I'd like you to explain those too, if you could, for me. Thank you very much.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249127" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONROY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Shortland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I'm going to begin where the minister began, which is talking about Australia's carbon pollution levels, because the minister wasn't telling the full story. If he were interested in being accurate and fair, he would have noted that, last year, pollution levels in this country rose by 1½ per cent. Australia's carbon pollution went up by 1½ per cent according to the government's own figures. As worryingly, in the last quarter alone carbon pollution in Australia went up by 0.83 per cent. Annualised, that is 2½ to three per cent. So my first question to the minister is: will he admit that he has failed as the environment and energy minister for this country? Pollution levels are up. He is a failure. He should come clean and admit that he has failed as minister. It is a legitimate question and I look forward to his answer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further evidence of his failure is that wholesale energy prices have doubled in his tenure. Wholesale electricity prices in this country have doubled in his time as minister. They have doubled because of this government's policy vacuum around energy policy since September 2013. Their first energy policy was to abolish the Renewable Energy Target. When that failed they then had the Emissions Reduction Fund, which did absolutely nothing for energy in this country. Then we had the glorious 12 hours of this government's commitment to the Emissions Intensity Scheme. Who can forget that glorious 12 hours! The minister did a great interview with Fran Kelly. It was quite a good performance, but the fossils in his party room were freaked out that he retreated and surrendered within 12 hours. It was the shortest war in the history of the energy crisis in this country—his commitment to the Emissions Intensity Scheme. Then we had the Clean Energy Target for six months, under Alan Finkel, and now we've got the National Energy Guarantee. Normally when you have an energy policy launch you have inches of documents, but this policy was an eight-page letter from the Energy Security Board. What is the price of all this? A doubling of wholesale energy prices. The Clean Energy Council's chief executive said yesterday that there is still no long-term unifying energy or climate change policy in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, what is the impact of the National Energy Guarantee, with its hopelessly inadequate 26 per cent target? We had the Clean Energy Council saying that the NEG is unlikely to encourage new renewable energy to drive down power prices as our old coal-fired power plants continue to close. The Smart Energy Council chief executive said the NEG effectively places a cap on renewables and removes the investment initiative and support for additional large scale renewable projects to come online. Bloomberg New Energy Finance, who are the premium analysts around the world in this area, said that after 2020, when the current Renewable Energy Target is met, investment under federal policies would be likely to fall off a cliff because the National Energy Guarantee, as currently floated by the federal government, would require very little effort to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the minister's own department was asked at estimates last week whether they agreed with this analysis, their strongest response was 'we're unsure'. They didn't rebut it; they said they were unsure about Bloomberg New Energy Finance's analysis that renewable energy investment, because of their renewable energy target, falls off a cliff. And they couldn't be stronger because they also admitted at estimates that they have done no modelling on the impact on renewable investment under the NEG. Bloomberg also said renewable energy investment is likely to taper in 2018 and then collapse. The former CEO of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Oliver Yates, said it is low-ambition energy, it is woeful and it locks inaction in place. Minister, what do you project renewable energy penetration to be by 2030 under your 26 per cent NEG? What is your planned trajectory post 2030 for Australia's decarbonisation? And what is the state of play of the Finkel recommendation around a three-year notice period? These are all important questions and I look forward to the answers.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr VAN MANEN:</span>
                    </a>  What's important in this is that, as a government, we are focused on improving our environment in a whole range of areas. There is far more to our environment than energy policy. My question to the minister in a little bit will be around energy policy because it is very important in that it affects the lives of everyday Australians—not just individual households but also businesses. We need to ensure that we have an energy policy that allows business to grow, prosper and employ Australians. That's what I see we are seeking to do with the energy policy that has been put forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get to that, I want to touch on the issue of the environment more broadly because I haven't heard a single word from those opposite about the day-to-day lived experience of our local environment. The member for Leichhardt, in his contribution, showed how critically important that is on a day-to-day basis with what we're doing on the Great Barrier Reef. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the minister to speak more broadly about the portfolio and what we're doing to ensure that the lived environment that Australians live in every single day is being improved on a day-to-day basis. I look back at some of the stuff that my mother has done up at Mount Tamborine with rainforest regeneration and building riparian corridors on waterways to improve water quality and reduce erosion—practical, on-the-ground environmental measures that make a genuine difference to the lived and built environment that we all live in every single day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My first question to the minister is: could he please update the House on what we're doing in that space? I think it's part of the discussion that we don't have regularly enough. As a government, we're doing some really good stuff in that space that would be very helpful. I've touched on the National Energy Guarantee already in terms of the importance of ensuring that we have affordable, reliable electricity—that we do not again see the situation that occurred in South Australia and that we do not see that occur in other parts of Australia. We know that to employ people and to be able to afford to provide services and products—not to just the Australian marketplace but to the global marketplace that we are now competing in—businesses need affordable and reliable energy. I ask the minister: with the National Energy Guarantee and the other measures that we've been taking over the last six or 12 months in the space of energy, what have we been doing to ensure that we drive down electricity and gas prices, on a wholesale basis, to ensure that business can compete? We look at the free trade agreements that we have successfully signed across the globe to create the opportunity for business to export. If I look at a large business such as Teys abattoirs, which employs 800 people in my electorate, the energy costs are a major impediment to their cost-competitiveness on the global marketplace. So, Minister, can you please share with the House how, through the National Energy Guarantee, we're seeking to ensure that energy prices are affordable and reliable to ensure that businesses and households can maintain and use the energy they need on a day-to-day basis?</span>

I'm sure that he would agree that Australia's precious environment is vulnerable and must be protected in a way that is considered and sustainable. Obviously, the Great Barrier Reef is arguably Australia's most precious natural asset. It's of great economic benefit to Queensland. Many people come from all around the world to see it. Recently, we heard Sir David Attenborough, one of the most respected naturalists in the world, say that Far North Queensland is his favourite part of the world. I'm not just saying that because I'm married to someone from Cairns!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very surprised to see and hear in the budget that the government has provided funding to protect the Great Barrier Reef. Initially, I was obviously very supportive. I will always support anything that can be done to support Australian tourism—Queensland tourism in particular.

                    </a>  I recognise that Labor funded this foundation when it was in government. Labor committed $3 million a year to the foundation, and we actually maintain a good working relationship with them. But funding of $444 million to one foundation that employs how many people? Six full-time members and five part-time members. That's a completely different ball game. It shows a complete error of judgement on the part of this government. What did Neville Wran say about the member for Wentworth? 'Fearless, but his greatest flaw was his lack of judgement.' And we see this again. This is the largest donation that any Australian government has made to a single foundation for environmental projects.</span>

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, located in Townsville, in the member for Herbert's electorate, only found out about it a week before it was announced. When questions were asked in Senate estimates last week, it became clear that the process, if there was one, was at best chaotic. Senate estimates left us with more questions than answers. We can't get an answer about when the decision to provide the funding was made and who made it, or whether any advice was received by the minister before the funding the announcement was made.</span>

Great runs on the board. Was the Reef Trust considered as an option before it was decided to give $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation? Was advice sought about whether the Reef Trust was a suitable candidate for the funding? Did you even use something called Google to see whether there were other entities available? With such a large funding grant, why was there not a competitive process undertaken to ensure that this funding was used to best benefit the Great Barrier Reef? Why was this very large funding grant of $444 million not kept in-house and spread over different areas? Why was it necessary to give $444 million to one organisation over a one- or two-month period? Why was it to be allocated in this financial year? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

These practical, on-the-ground types of programs will cover things like protecting threatened species, which I'll talk a little more about shortly, Ramsar wetlands, threatened ecological communities, the natural heritage, outstanding universal value of world heritage properties, soil biodiversity, and vegetation, and supporting agricultural systems to adapt to change.

We don't get to talk about good news too much in this place—certainly the media's not that interested. But I want to talk about the good work that this government is doing with respect to Australia's threatened species, because we have got a wonderful story to tell. Last week I had the pleasure of visiting Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, where I announced we would invest some $400,000 how in a raft of new projects to protect some of Australia's most vulnerable species. Our government's contribution, I'm very proud to say, has leveraged an additional $750,000 from a variety of organisations—providing cash and in-kind contributions, which of course is an excellent result for the nation as a whole.</span>

This government recognise the importance of protecting and preserving our threatened species. In 2013 we appointed Australia's first Threatened Species Commissioner and in 2015 we launched the first national Threatened Species Strategy. Last year, we invited the private sector to join the fight against extinction, through the threatened species prospectus. Over the last four years, more than $255 million has been allocated to some 1,200 projects across Australia. Sally Box, who joined me at Tidbinbilla last week, is now Australia's second Threatened Species Commissioner—</span>

                    </a>  I agree. She's doing an outstanding job. Dr Box will ensure we focus our efforts and broker really positive solutions for our environment that support Australia's threatened plants and animals. This work is underlined by the new initiative that we announced last week. At Tidbinbilla the federal government is going to provide 80,000 to support the creation of a predator-proof area that will help to recover brush-tailed rock wallabies. This is the cutest animal. It has a tail about a metre long. It really is quite the rock star in its own environment. We enjoyed that experience very much. In addition to the immediate benefits, the research we gather will guide the future reintroduction programs for the rock wallaby. It is a great example of this government's commitment to preserving Australia's wildlife and demonstrating what can be achieved through collaboration. I would like to acknowledge the contribution of Zoos Victoria and the ACT government to this project at Tidbinbilla. They are also committed to the work with threatened species. </span>

In the Northern Territory, feral cat control will protect the critically endangered central rock rat. In South Australia, a project on Kangaroo Island will improve habitat for the Kangaroo Island gannet, the hooded plover and the eastern curlew. The project will greatly increase the number of cats culled nationally, helping us reach the target of two million cats culled by 2020. </span>

Next month, I have the pleasure of going to Kangaroo Island and meeting up with the Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife group who, with our support, will manage the delivery of this critically important initiative. One other project I would like to mention is in Queensland. We are partnering with the Macadamia Conservation Trust to develop replica collections of the endangered Bulberin nut tree. </span>

Their protection is something that I take very seriously, as does the Minister for the Environment and Energy, as does our government. As the Assistant Minister for the Environment, it is my commitment to ensure the government continues to deliver on its strong record.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Batman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  The disaster that is this government's climate change policy is of monumental proportions. It is totally clear that this is not a priority for the government despite what the minister and his colleagues on that side of the room try to tell us. They are burying their collective head in the sand, having no idea how to undo the damage their divided and dysfunctional party room is really doing to our economy and to Australia's future. The PM has completely abandoned his once strident belief in combating climate change, and the Treasurer made no mention of climate change in his budget speech—not one! This beggars belief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget delivers zero dollars to combat climate change. Pollution levels are rising. Polar ice sheets are melting. Sea levels are rising. We're seeing reduced rainfall in important agricultural regions, more extreme heat episodes and intense weather events. The health impacts are alarming, and we are heading for economic changes that will not benefit workers and their communities. In fact, this government teeter on the brink of recklessness on this issue. They place all Australians at risk of serious climate events growing in intensity, at risk of falling behind the rest of the world and our international competitors in the renewable energy sector, at risk of leaving whole communities bereft without the means of making a living because, as the world relies less on thermal coal, our communities that rely on that industry will have no plan for a transition. If we only had a plan, a decent plan, Australia could be leading the way in this region and leading the battle against climate change. With certainty instead of chaos, we could be encouraging clean energy production, sustainable industries, investment in sustainable communities and jobs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a plan. It is comprehensive, it is ambitious and it is achievable. It will tackle this wide-ranging and complex issue, and give policy certainty to investors craving opportunities to set up in Australia. It will give industry already here the ability to plan for the future and start making changes that will ensure our economy is sustainable and clean. It will also go to the problem of supporting workers as the world moves to a cleaner, more sustainable future. Workers who rely on polluting industries and whose future is uncertain need to know that they will not be left in the lurch, that they will be helped to transition to new jobs, with training, with options like redundancy pooling that we've seen in the Latrobe Valley, with plans to diversify their communities' economies—future proofing them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not an easy thing to do. It will require thought and resources and collaboration with the major companies in the industries who might—just might—have to sit in the one room and share information that once might have been deemed unsharable. But this is possible and it has been done. It might require those companies to work together for the benefit of the workers and their families in the region. It will require the goodwill and cooperation of unions who represent the workers and their families by negotiating fair and reasonable outcomes. It will require the government of the day to coordinate the processes and to build a policy framework that foresees the future of these industries, with expert analysis, timelines and dedicated financial and human resources. You see, if you're a vulnerable worker worried about the future, worried about how you will support your family, worried about everything then it is hard to support change. If you know there is a plan for and your family, you can be part of the change. No-one should be abandoned. No-one should be left bereft when, with proper planning and foresight, we can do our best for everyone.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had firsthand experience of this. I was lucky enough to be part of the development of a just transition policy at the ACTU. We had a massive consultation day with over 200 people there. We drew together the coal-fired power station operators, the owners, the workers and the unions. We had government—state and federal—represented. I take the opportunity to thank Mark Butler and Pat Conroy for their attendance that day. We had the environment sector, the small business sector and the local community, and we agreed on a way forward. It formed the groundwork for the excellent work done by the Daniel Andrews Victorian government when ENGIE announced it was closing Hazelwood. And when the other companies pull out one by one, we will be ready. In fact, it could form the basis for a just transition for any sector of our economy that is undergoing change. It is a plan, and that is what is sorely lacking from this government.</span>

They have the member for Hunter, who sold out workers in his own electorate, and a union leader who sold out her own members. The Labor Party is too concerned with its green left flank, winning seats like Batman and other inner Melbourne seats, and abandoning the thousands and thousands of blue-collar manufacturing workers across this country.

The member for Batman should go back to her electorate and the socialist green collective of which she is a part and tell them that when Labor was last in government they doubled power prices. So the pensioner in Parramatta, the small business worker in Shortland, the cafe owner in Richmond have all paid more for their power bills as a result of the Labor Party's policies.</span>

We have also seen an attempt to reduce the power prices by intervening in the gas market, which the Labor Party ignored, by passing legislation to stop the gouging of consumers by the poles and wires companies. If the Labor Party had done that when they were last in office it would have saved them $6½ billion. We are getting better deal from the retailers and also promoting the Energy Security Board's recommendation of the National Energy Guarantee.</span>

Of course, this is a record financial commitment by the coalition into supporting the barrier reef, which will support the member for Leichhardt's electorate and many others in Queensland. The member for Macquarie also raised the issue of the 19th-century Thompson Square and the brick barrel drains. I have written to the Premier of New South Wales about the importance of that site.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  It is a great honour to speak tonight about this year's budget and the commitment that this government is making to build on the $4 billion agricultural competitiveness white paper that we put in place. Not only are we making sure that farmers get more money in their pockets but that small regional communities that support them are also benefitting, because the more money that goes into farmers' pockets the more they spend in these small regional communities, so I have a responsibility as the minister for agriculture to empower not only agriculture and make it more vibrant and more profitable but also those small regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this year's budget does is focus us in on where we have contributed, not only through the competitive ag. white paper but also through our trade agreements with China, Japan, South Korea and Peru, and now through the TPP-11, a $13.7 trillion marketplace that we are going to give our farmers access to. Those are real options that we are providing to our farmers. But to unpack those trade agreements we need to unpick the technical barriers that exist. We've got 15 agricultural counsellors around the world in embassies and high commissions, and we're going to up that by another six. We're going to give real grunt to these trade agreements; we're going to put boots on the ground. It means that we are giving our farmers more market access, commodity by commodity, working through them in a systematic way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making sure in this budget that we're keeping our clean, green image. That's our trading advantage. That's something we should be proud of. We're making continued investment in that, which builds on the $200 million that was put in place under the competitive ag. white paper for biosecurity. That's a significant investment, and we're going to double-up again this year and make another significant investment in biosecurity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to the gas roots as well. We're looking at pests and weeds, making sure that we eradicate those pests and weeds in partnership with farmers, so that they get greater productivity and profitability. The estimated cost of the pests and weeds that pervade the landscape of this nation is around $4 billion to $5 billion a year, so it's important we unlock that potential and ensure that we give our farmers the opportunity in partnership to eradicate these—also in terms of biosecurity risk of our exports. It is also important that we've looked at forestry. We're going to empower the forestry industry. There's a $20 million investment in the forestry industry to unlock the potential. We're currently seeing record prices in forestry products. We're going to look at investing strategically in new technologies that will mean we get better returns for our forestry industry. That's an important part that we're also looking at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that have really struck me since becoming agriculture minister as I've got around the country and made sure that I have got to as many farms, to as many machinery sheds and packing sheds and listened to farmers is the labour constraints of them getting their food off the vine, off the tree, out of the paddock and on a boat overseas. Wherever I've gone the issues around that have been raised, so it's important we make investments that make sure we can map that, that we get the science behind the labour requirements we need and where and when. So we're making a strategic investment and ensuring that we can give that science and make sure that we can make the decisions predicated on ensuring that that product comes off the tree and onto the boat as quickly as we can. This is about empowering our agricultural sector, pulling the right levers to get greater productivity and greater profitability for our farmers, and making sure we understand the drivers to the farm gate and post the farm gate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's an important step that this budget moves towards, and I'm proud to say that we've done that in a systematic way. But we've also made investments in terms of agvet chemicals, ensuring that research and development and getting those products that aren't readily used or are used to a smaller extent are getting the attention they need, because that also builds the productivity that we need in this nation to keep the agricultural sector moving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've signed up to the NFS ambitious vision of a $100 billion industry by 2030. That's achievable, but it's going to take some work and it means government has to get out of the way. We have to empower the agricultural sector to do what they do best, which is grow the best food and fibre in the world. We have to allow them to do that, and this budget sets that foundation. It builds on the ag competitive white paper and the $4 billion investment we made. We're going to continue to invest to empower or agricultural sector and our regional communities to thrive to the next level.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I welcome Minister Littleproud to appropriations in detail. This is his debut. I can inform him tonight that I'm in a pretty good mood. I'm feeling pretty mellow. I just issued a challenge to him in the House of Representatives. Tomorrow I will be amending export bill, which imposes additional fines on the live-ex sector. I will put in an amendment which mirrors the private member's bill of the member for Farrer. I will be inviting him to support the amendment. I've done the right thing and I've foreshadowed the amendment for those opposite who share my concerns. I put it seriously to the government that it should give very serious and genuine consideration of those amendments if they are serious about doing something about community expectations in the live export trade but also helping us work together to ensure that there is a long-term future for other aspects of the live trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to help the minister—before I go there, I should say I welcomed the minister's attempt to show his vision for the agriculture sector with us. I was a bit surprised that he mentioned the now widely discredited white paper, which now seems to have been replaced with the NFF's paper, which he also seems to be endorsing. I don't know if you need an NFF white paper if you've already got a white paper yourself. On the $100 billion value of the industry: great. I think it's underdone. I think you get to $100 billion if you stick on the same trajectory we've been on for the last 10 years. I think we want better than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to start with a Dorothy Dixer for the minister. I know he will find it very easy to answer. I would like to know, very seriously: what is the problem with sharing information about the awassi incident with the Western Australia government? If there's a legislative barrier, how can we work together to overcome it? I would have thought that the minister in WA has responsibility under their own animal welfare act. The minister said he was serious about getting to the bottom of the awassi incident. On that basis, I would have thought he would be happy to share the information with the Western Australian government. If there is barrier, how can we work together to overcome it?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  I share the minister's bullish vision for agriculture. Indeed, I share the member for Hunter's bullish vision for agriculture. Minister, you haven't had the great privilege of coming to the greatest electorate on earth, and I extend that invitation here and now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the limitations to achieving that herculean objective is going to be the ability for industry to meet agriculture's labour demands. Minister, I, as you do, visit constituents who have invested their hard-earned money in their agricultural endeavour. I visit people who with their own hands have grafted orchards. They make wine. They raise cattle. They raise lambs. I've seen people picking pistachios. But the reality here is that we will only achieve this objective if we find the labour force to do it. I should say as an aside that we will also need to attract the capital to do it, but that's not where my question is directed. My question speaks to and talks about agriculture's labour demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in the House will understand what I say when I say that my electorate suffered a significant loss in the form of the Thomas Foods abattoir at Murray Bridge: 1,500 workers processing meat in my electorate at Murray Bridge. This is a multispecies abattoir. It's both large body and small body. There were 1,500 workers, Minister. Of those 1,500 workers, 500 were Australian; 500, effectively, were on 417 visas; and roughly 500 were on 457 visas. Given the size and scale of this enterprise—to the minister—it is not just small operators who are struggling to source labour. It's even the very largest. Indeed, that particular abattoir is the largest employer in my electorate. It's even the very largest of employers that are struggling in rural, regional and remote Australia to find the workforce they need to deliver the products, as you say, onto the boat and into export markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's one thing for us to have signed world-leading trade deals with the powerhouse economies of northern Asia. It's another thing to have signed them with the TPP-11. It's another thing entirely to be able to meet the demand of these markets. So, at the same time that I see unemployment in some of these rural communities, particularly amongst younger people, and at the same time as we're having—or did have, in recent memory—a debate around the backpackers tax, I have a circumstance in my electorate where I've got high rates of unemployment and yet I've got very high levels of foreign labour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I sit down with employers throughout my electorate, they're very keen to use a more sustainable mix of Australian workers. But the reality is that they're forced to use foreign labour because that is the only labour they can source. And I should say thank goodness for the 88-day rule. I'm fairly certain that, if it weren't for that rule, we would have fruit going rotten on the tree and grapes going rotten on the vine; we would have kill slots at abattoirs simply unfilled or unable to be filled; and who knows what would happen to our credibility on the international stage in terms of our ability to meet orders and commitments?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, my question effectively is: what is the government doing to better meet these agricultural labour demands? Minister, this is—and I'm confident in saying this—both the single largest concern for rural constituents who have invested their hard-earned in their rural enterprise and the single largest risk to the federal government in terms of improving our terms of trade when it relates to agricultural exports. We have constituents throughout rural, regional and remote Australia who want to invest and are investing, but, without the labour force to do the work to ensure that these products are delivered to market, we simply won't achieve those bullish targets that, Minister, you're setting for yourself, that I set for myself and that, quite frankly, our nation should expect of us all.</span>

                    </a>  No, it's effective as of 1 July. But let me make this clear: the department, as the regulator, has to perceive a degree of confidentiality in terms of the information of the investigation that it's undertaking. It's only natural. It's a good thing. That allows a proper prosecution to take place, if one is to take place. But here's the kicker. At no point—at no point—did I ever get a formal request from Alannah MacTiernan, the Western Australian Minister for Agriculture and Food, for sharing information. This is a stunt. This is nothing more than a political stunt.</span>

Well, here's your opportunity. Don't play politics. Alannah MacTiernan has lost her way on this. She's overreached, she doesn't understand the powers of state and federal governments. The reality is that this is nothing more than a cheap stunt. She's never written to me. In fact, the only thing that she's asked for was some cooperation. Do you know what we did? We wrote back and gave her the process under FOI in which to get the information, so she got the cooperation. There are restrictions around law. Is the alternative agriculture minister saying that he would ignore the law? Is that what he's saying? You can't be the minister and flout the law. That is what is in front of me. This is nothing more than a stunt. It's a shame that it's transcended into this. I thought the member for Hunter was smarter than to tie his boat to the Western Australian agriculture minister.

                    </a>  It is a poignant question. We are at crossroads, but we are making steps. We're engaging with Horticulture Australia and the NFF to ensure that we get the settings right. Obviously I have to engage with other agencies to make sure that we get the settings right with Home Affairs and Michaelia Cash in workforce planning. We are working in a strategic way, but what we need is the science. The investment in the budget will go towards getting that science to make sure the decisions that we make are predicated on science. Unfortunately, those opposite have left that behind recently. They've gone on emotion, not science.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:06</span>):  I asked the minister a very genuine question about the Awassi Express investigation. I think it's reasonable to ask why the Western Australian government doesn't have access to that information. I acknowledge there may have been a legal barrier. I gave the minister that courtesy and he chose to give a highly politically charged answer. He can't have it both ways. First, he says he's issued an order and then, only through prompting from my intervention, he told us that the order doesn't take effect until 1 July. I thought he might want to answer why it doesn't take effect until 1 July. There might be a perfectly reasonable legal answer to that. He could have taken the opportunity to explain that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the Western Australian government has community expectations too. They want to exercise their right to investigate the matter themselves. The minister now says he's happy to put in place an order so that they can, having just argued that they shouldn't, but he's not going to give them access until 1 July. He said he was never asked and then he said he responded by saying, 'You've got to take action under Freedom of Information.' You can't respond to correspondence you never received! He can't have it both ways. He can't say they didn't write to him and then say he responded in certain terms. Unbelievable. I give him the opportunity to explain why the order does not take effect until 1 July.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to hear the minister talk about biosecurity—probably his most critical responsibility as the minister. I note that he's crowing about a vision for the sector, but they've been in government for five years. After five years, he's going to spend $20 million and have another forestry plan. We've already had a number of them in five years, and we're supposed to be thankful that now we're going to spend $20 million creating another plan. I want to ask him a serious and genuine question about biosecurity. As he knows the Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity is coming to its expiry date. I think we had an excellent review of the intergovernmental agreement. It's almost compulsory reading, I think, for anyone who is interested in agriculture and biosecurity in particular. There are 42 recommendations. I could ask the minister whether he's going to embrace the recommendations, but he'll flick it back off to an AGMIN process, no doubt, but I'll give him the opportunity. What I really want to know is when he's going to take this matter back to the state ministers. When will we have a response to the IGAB review? It was, I remind him, due in mid-2018. We're pretty much in mid-2018. The habit of the last minister—and I know that the minister, on a daily basis, is striving to do better—was to have AGMIN meetings, as they called them. They're no replacement whatsoever for the SCoPI process, which this government abolished. It's unbelievable. They abolished the COAG progress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't have a proper and adequate biosecurity framework in this country if you're not working hand in hand with the states. The first act of this government? They abolish the COAG committee that was in charge of these things, the Standing Council on Primary Industries. I can see the minister frowning. I don't think he's ever heard of it, by the expression on his face. We now have this AGMIN process. The former minister had the habit of having it meet once a year. I'm concerned that it was supposed to be renewed in the middle of this year, and AGMIN might not be meeting until the middle of next year. I want to know when that agreement will be reached so that we can get on with consolidating our biosecurity framework.</span>

It harks back to the great vision of going from $60 billion worth of agricultural exports to $100 billion. We have the current minister, who wants to grow opportunity, and this is how you grow opportunity. In my patch, we had the overhang of Senator Penny Wong as the water minister, which was shutting down our irrigated agriculture, and we saw the investment of $103 million so that we could grow more product. We had a trade minister who wanted to take our product overseas, and we've signed free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China and signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I used to be on the Treaties Committee, and we did inquiries into these free trade agreements. Time after time, the unions would come in and say, 'These are terrible agreements.'</span>

This is the same old, same old Labor. Can I just remind people of a little bit of history here? In 1974, under the great Gough Whitlam, 40,000 cattle in Victoria were shot because there wasn't a market for them. Ban it, tax it, shut it down. Same old Labor. In 1992, thousands of sheep crossed Australia. Who was the Prime Minister in 1992? I think it was a Labor Prime Minister—that's it. Ban it, tax it, shut it down. I had great visions for Joel.</span>

You actually build the water infrastructure, you build the rail infrastructure to get it to port and you build the market opportunities—Korea, China, Japan and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. They reckon they're eventually going to take a million tonnes of Australian wheat to Peru. I've got to say, it doesn't just happen.

The great contrast in this—and this is why I am very supportive of asking you this question—is that you appear to have a vision. You appear to have the process to turn $60 billion worth of exports into $100 billion worth of exports—as opposed to the alternative minister, who wants to ban it, tax it and shut it down.</span>

I said that after five years the government is going to have another plan for forestry. But she has pointed out that they never had a plan, so that was a mistake. In 2015 they had an issues paper, in 2016 they had a discussion paper and now, in the budget, they have announced that they are going to develop a plan. So I stand corrected on that point.</span>

I will give him the opportunity to answer two questions when he rises to his feet. The second question is around the other intergovernmental agreement of great interest to me, and that is the one on drought. That intergovernmental agreement also expires in July this year. When will the matter go to ag min again? Do we have to wait another year? What happens in the meantime? Is the current intergovernmental agreement rolling over and will it remain in place until then? What work, if any, has been done, as envisaged by SCoPI when the states agreed to the intergovernmental agreement, to assess the effectiveness of the objectives laid down in the original intergovernmental agreement?</span>

I'm going to resist the temptation and take him up on that offer. He should walk out in embarrassment. He claims to be an advocate for the forestry sector. Given what I just said about this government's paltry performance over five years with another plan, he should hang his head and walk out in shame!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  It is a pleasure to make a contribution to the debate tonight given that the largest contributor in my electorate is, without a doubt, agriculture—through the horticultural sector, through the meat processing sector and through the saleyard. It is the largest employer. I remember coming into this chamber and speaking on an industrial relations issue. On the other side, it was wall-to-wall high-viz vests directing traffic—there were that many members there taking up the cause. But when it comes to debating our second largest exporter, agriculture, they are like crickets on the other side of the room—there are only a very few members. Agriculture is such an important part of my electorate. We currently have Eat Local Week underway. We have incredible exporters and we send product around the world. The Lockyer Valley, which is in the top 10 fertile valleys in the world, is often referred to as the salad bowl of Australia. But the reality is that we mostly produce vegetables—carrots, corn, broccoli, cauliflower, all the brassicas, and leeks, capsicums and tomatoes. There is a little bit of salad there, but most of it is vegetables; it is fibre. It's very labour intensive. As I said in my opening statements, that's where we get our high labour content from. We do rely on international labour to get our products to market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, I had the good Minister for Agriculture, Mr Littleproud, in my electorate, who, with the Prime Minister, made an announcement of $51 million to assist our growers to get product into international markets, because we have such an appetite for free trade agreements. At face value, those sitting at home in their lounge rooms watching this stimulating broadcast tonight would be asking: 'What's the inhibiter for growers in my electorate and around Australia getting product into other nations?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has an aggressive appetite for free trade. I suggest that, behind those free trade agreements, Australia has a very clean, green image that it wants to maintain and, behind that, we have biosecurity protocols that we have in place to protect Australian product from being contaminated because that's what gives us a competitive advantage. That's what allows us to go to the global markets, to put product on shelves overseas, and maintain that environmental dominance, maintain that product quality dominance that we have in so many product ranges. But those protocols can be an inhibiter when we are trying to put product into markets around the world. As a result, this government, through the announcement that the minister made the other day has budgeted there's $51 million to try and start breaking down those barriers, of which I know the minister will make a contribution to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suggested in my opening comments that my electorate was the biggest contributor to GDP. I have no fewer than 2,483 agricultural businesses in my electorate registered with the Australian Taxation Office. In addition to that, just to throw context to the gravity of how much we rely on agriculture, we're also integrated and linked with the transport sector, and I have no fewer than 11,240 registered single transport operators. My question tonight to the minister is: can the minister outline the coalition's investment and measures in the budget to strengthen the biosecurity systems? Why is this important to Australia and to my electorate of Wright?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SWANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:23</span>):  I want to pick up where the shadow minister for agriculture—the member for Hunter—left off in asking the minister about the intergovernmental agreement that was signed between the Commonwealth and New South Wales in 2013, particularly the point about managing drought assistance. To give the minister some understanding, I represent the fair City of Maitland, which has a very rich history in agriculture. It was the food bowl of New South Wales for many years. As my late father said, 'That dirt would grow babies.' It is rich, alluvial, Hunter floodplain ground. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing a drought in the Hunter like never seen before. It is terrible. The Maitland saleyards, which are a major part of our local economy, are currently putting cattle through at $350 less per head than this time last year. And we have farmers now shooting. That is not what you want. They're worried about losing their breeding stock. It is dire in the Hunter. But the thing that is most dire is that our farmers locally have absolutely lost confidence in this government and what it is going to do for them. In 2013, the government removed exceptional circumstances and said there would be a plan in concert with the COAG agreement with the states, that we would look towards drought-proofing for the future, that we would look towards upskilling our farmers, giving them some tools. When we knew that more droughts would be coming in the future, SCoPI was put in place. Now that has all been torn asunder. Nothing has happened. The previous minister for agriculture abrogated his responsibility. That plan winds up very shortly. There's been nothing done to replace it, and farmers in my electorate of Paterson are absolutely desperate. Not only are they facing the day-to-day trials and hardships of drought; they're now saying, 'We've been left'. This was signed in 2013. Not a dot has been done, and they want to know what's going to be on offer to give them a hand into the future. So, minister, I'd like you to tell me how that's progressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the matters that was raised was that we would have the Regional Investment Corporation that would administer loans to the agricultural sector in general, not just the drought stricken areas. That organisation, as I understand it, is due to commence its responsibilities on 1 July. No staff have been advertised for yet. There is no CEO. How are these loans going to be administered if this hasn't even occurred at this very late stage? I would very much like some detail on what is going on there. I would like some detail on SCoPI and how we are going to move the agriculture sector forward more broadly. In very specific terms, how are we going to face down things like the drought that we are seeing in my part of the world? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I just say, I talk to a lot of people in my area about agriculture and they really have felt completely abandoned. I know that our recent agriculture minister is fairly new, and he has been pretty busy doing a lot of stuff in relation to live export. I know that has probably taken up a lot of his time. But food production and maintenance of the breeding herd in areas such as mine are absolutely critical to agriculture. What is going on with that intergovernmental agreement? What is the way forward? There is no more exceptional circumstances. What's going to replace it and how are we going to help farmers who are absolutely desperate at the moment? How are we going to help them to put food on their tables? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the Household Assistance Package. As the shadow agriculture minister pointed out, that's wrapping up. You put a three-year time frame on it, but the drought is still going—in fact, it's worse than ever in Paterson and the Hunter. How are we going to on a practical level assist people? With an eye to the horizon in agriculture and the technologies that are in place, how are we going to turn things around in the agriculture sector? In my seat of Paterson but also more broadly across the country, it really is very dire.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  I'll answer some of the questions that the member for Hunter raised, particularly around that order—I didn't hear it because of the interjections. It was put in place for 1 July for its practical application. That's why it has taken us time—the department has advised me—to be able to practically apply it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the biosecurity intergovernmental agreement, at AGMIN in April this year, we spoke about and accepted all 42 recommendations. Part of the budget measures is about addressing our financial contribution to that. We now have to get the states to make their contribution. They have to make the contribution to 2016-17 levels. So it is now down to the states to do that. I reach out across the aisle and ask you to work with your state Labor colleagues to come on that journey. We are hoping to have that done offline during the rest of this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of drought, I don't intend to be lectured by those opposite about drought. When we took over, there was nothing in the cupboard. There was zero, zilch. Since we've come to power, we've put over a billion dollars on the table, not just for farms but for communities. A billion dollars—$880 million through concessional loans; 7,900 families have had access to farm household assistance; 2,400 of those have come off it. Of the 2,400 to come off it, 85 per cent have said that the farm household assistance program helped them through, because it's not just about putting dollars in their pockets to put bread and butter on the table. It's also about building resilience in their business. We assign them a case manager that builds resilience in their business. It goes far beyond that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don’t intend to be lectured when my electorate has been in drought for seven years—seven long years. But what we've done is put an environment around it to make sure that the concessional loans—also making sure that these smaller shires—we've done a drought community program where each shire gets $1.5 million to go and build projects in that community using local contractors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's because it's not just the farmers that hurt during drought; it's the small businesses that hurt as well. That's what those opposite don't understand. They don't live out there, and they don't care. The reality is that it's these small communities and these small-business owners that hurt from it. That's the reality. Not only are we making sure that we're looking after farmers in keeping the money flowing but we're also making sure that we're going to keep contractors going as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're building that resilience for when the next drought comes, with respect to pests and weeds, with $25.8 million just for drought communities to be able to tackle pests and weeds. For dog fencing, in the state of Queensland alone, there is $13 million that we put in. The state government are only just catching up to us now, even though this is a state responsibility. And then they tried to claim $18 million which the Longreach Regional Council undertook themselves through a loan process to lend out to their ratepayers, and it was paid back through their rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the shysty attempt of everybody on that side to say they understand agriculture. But do you know what? Let me go further. Let me go further about the RIC, because that is delivering concessional loans. But do you know why we've got a delay? Because you didn't allow us to get it through. But do you know what? What you've done has just highlighted my first parliamentary win in my first parliamentary week as a minister in getting the Regional Investment Corporation Bill through. It blew you away! You didn't even see it coming, nor did Senator Wong. You did not see it coming. But let me just finish on this.</span>
