                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will establish legislation for a national redress scheme (the scheme) for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children placed in the trust of our institutions were some of the most vulnerable members in our community. That any were sexually abused by the very people charged with their care and protection is a disgrace. No child should ever experience what they did. That is why it is time for all institutions and governments to take responsibility for what happened.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of the scheme is an acknowledgement by the Australian government and participating governments that sexual abuse suffered by children in institutional settings was wrong. It was a betrayal of trust. It should never have happened.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It recognises the suffering survivors have experienced and accepts that these events occurred and that institutions must take responsibility for this abuse.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government acknowledged the need to provide public recognition of the suffering experienced by survivors and investigate the inadequate responses provided by institutions through the establishment of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (the royal commission). </span>

All governments and individual institutions were directed to make amends and take responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission estimates that almost 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government institutions. The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission has clearly demonstrated that thousands of vulnerable children were subject to horrendous sexual abuse in institutions throughout Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The psychological, physical and emotional injuries can affect a survivor for the rest of their life. In spite of the severity of these injuries, many survivors have not sought or obtained any kind of acknowledgement or redress for this harm.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of a national redress scheme acknowledges the abuse that occurred. It is the most significant step in addressing the wrongs of the past and providing a just response to survivors.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should the bill pass, the participation of these governments will mean that, from 1 July 2018, the scheme will be available for over 9,000 people who were sexually abused in New South Wales government institutions, 5,000 people in Victorian government institutions, 200 people in Australian Capital Territory institutions and 1,000 people in Commonwealth government institutions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will adopt a survivor-focused and trauma-informed approach; access to redress will be simple, and support will be available throughout the application and acceptance processes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme is not intended to replace legal avenues to seek justice. It is intended to provide a survivor with a means to access a sense of justice, through monetary redress and through restorative supports.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is intended to be faster, simpler and less distressing for survivors and to provide governments and institutions with the means to deliver justice to their survivors.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill aligns with the views of the Independent Advisory Council on Redress, which included many survivor groups, as well as the views of jurisdictions and non-government institutions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Should the bill pass, the scheme will commence accepting applications from survivors of institutional child sexual abuse for which the Commonwealth and other participating governments and institutions are responsible from 1 July 2018.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will run for 10 years, with all applications to be finalised by 30 June 2028. The scheme can be extended if there is a need to do so.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a person to be eligible for redress they must have suffered sexual abuse where a participating institution is responsible and it occurred when the person was a child before the scheme's commencement on 1 July 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A person must also be an Australian citizen or permanent resident at the time they apply for redress, although it will be possible to deem additional classes of people eligible for redress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While a person must have suffered sexual abuse to be eligible, the scheme will also acknowledge related non-sexual abuse, for example physical abuse. Sexual abuse rarely occurs in isolation and it is important to deal with the whole of the survivor's experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Applications for redress under the scheme are limited to one application per survivor, whether or not that person suffered sexual abuse in more than one institution.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will ensure that survivors will only need to complete one form to cover all instances of child sexual abuse experienced in institutional contexts during their childhood, something the royal commission recommended to achieve equal or fair treatment between survivors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Survivors providing the story of their experience in full will ensure the scheme can consider the totality of their experience.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, to ensure the scheme retains flexibility and is able to meet prevailing community standards, there will be a special assessment of applicants with serious criminal convictions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If a person is convicted of an offence which received a custodial sentence of five or more years, the operator may determine that the person is entitled to redress if providing redress to the person would not bring the scheme into disrepute or adversely affect public confidence in the scheme.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When making this determination, the operator must take into account any relevant information such as advice given by relevant attorneys-general and the nature of the offence.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People will not be able to make an application for redress if they are in jail. However, the operator will have power to provide exemptions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People must be 18 years of age before the scheme sunset day to make an application for redress under the scheme.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those eligible survivors, the amount of the monetary payment will be determined by looking closely at the circumstances of each person and applying consistent criteria. The maximum amount of redress payment available under the scheme will be $150,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The expected average payment will be around $76,000—$11,000 higher than that estimated by the royal commission.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The payment will not reduce the income support payments of survivors, will not be divisible property for bankruptcy and will be exempt from Commonwealth debt recovery.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Depending on the residence of a survivor, they will receive either a lump sum payment to access counselling and psychological services privately, or will be given access to state or territory based services. States and territories will elect for survivors residing in their jurisdiction to either receive the lump sum payment or whether they will deliver counselling and psychological services to those survivors. Survivors residing outside Australia will receive the lump sum payment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Responsible participating institutions will be liable for the same amount to support the delivery of counselling and psychological services.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Survivors will also have the opportunity to receive a direct personal response from the participating institution or institutions responsible for the abuse. A direct personal response is a statement of acknowledgement, regret or apology and will be delivered to survivors by the relevant participating institution after the survivor has accepted the offer of redress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The response may be delivered through a range of mechanisms including a face-to-face meeting with an appropriate representative of the institution or through written engagement with the survivor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The direct personal response will give the survivor the chance to be acknowledged and tell their personal story of what they experienced and how it has impacted them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of the redress scheme is to provide an avenue for survivors of child sexual abuse who have not been able to pursue, or have not been successful in pursuing, their common-law rights in order to obtain compensation for the damage and loss they have suffered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many survivors cannot successfully pursue their common-law rights because they do not have access to the necessary evidence, or because going through litigation processes would be overly traumatic for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before a survivor receives redress, the survivor must accept their offer by signing an acceptance document. Accepting an offer of redress has the effect of releasing the responsible participating institution or institutions, and their associates and officials, from any future liability for all instances of sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse of the person within the scope of the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This means that the survivor cannot bring or continue any civil claim against the responsible participating institution or institutions, and their associates and officials, in relation to the specific abuse once they accept the offer of redress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The release will not release the perpetrators of abuse themselves, provide release in relation to any other abuse outside the scope of the scheme, nor preclude any criminal liabilities of the institution or alleged perpetrator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The release from civil liability is an important incentive for institutions as without it, institutions may be required to pay compensation through civil litigation in addition to providing redress under the scheme. It will ensure greater coverage for survivors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any relevant prior payments made by participating institutions in relation to the abuse for which an institution is responsible will be adjusted to acknowledge inflation and then will be subtracted from the redress payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, these survivors would receive a 'top-up' payment. If a survivor's monetary payment is reduced to nil as a result of past redress payments, they will still be entitled to access counselling and psychological services and the direct personal response under the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rules will also specify that where a court has previously ordered a participating institution to pay a person compensation or damages for abuse, then that person will not be eligible under the scheme for that abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where a survivor has been successful in civil litigation, a court has already applied the higher legal liability test of the 'balance of probabilities' and found that the institution is liable to pay the survivor damages.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme is based on the principle of 'responsible entity pays', a key recommendation of the royal commission. A participating responsible institution will be expected to pay for redress for their survivors, along with a proportionate share of the administration costs of the scheme. This is the best way to ensure fairness and justice for survivors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a participating institution to be responsible, the abuse must have occurred in circumstances where the institution was primarily or equally responsible for the abuser having contact with the person.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will have agreed categories of cases where responsible governments will share responsibility with an institution, as set out in the national redress scheme rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If a case falls into an agreed category, the relevant government will automatically be determined to be equally responsible and therefore liable for redress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Participating governments have agreed to be responsible where abuse occurs in connection with a non-government institution, the state or territory government had parental responsibility of the child or the child was a state ward, and was responsible for the placement of the child in that institution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In cases where a government is determined to be equally responsible, they may be determined to be the funder of last resort. This will only occur when the other equally responsible institution is a defunct non-government institution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where a funder-of-last-resort arrangement exists, the government that shares responsibility will pay the full amount of redress. The purpose of the funder-of-last-resort policy is to pick up shortfalls in funding where an institution no longer exists. It is not intended to pick up liability for institutions that have the capacity to opt in and choose not to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In cases where a person has suffered multiple cases of child sexual abuse which occurred across multiple institutions, the scheme operator will decide what was the responsible institution in each case. Each responsible institution will contribute a share of the redress for the survivor. The redress contribution will be apportioned in accordance with the severity and impact of each instance of abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will facilitate flexible arrangements to support the different structures of institutions opting in to the scheme. This is necessary as many institutions we think of as one institution can actually consist of different institutions and entities. It is in the interest of survivors for all of these institutions to opt in and participate as a single group. This will allow larger institutions to provide the funding for their lower level institutions that may not have their own financial sources to cover redress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will allow two or more institutions to form a participating group, who will be 'associates' of one another. To be able to form a participating group, associates must have a sufficient connection with each other, appoint a representative, and have that representative be jointly and severally liable with each associate for funding contributions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill includes provisions for the use and disclosure of information under the scheme. Information-sharing protocols have been balanced against the need for the scheme to have transparency and flexibility, with a survivor's rights to privacy and the need to protect children against future abuse. This will ensure all aspects of the scheme's ability to share and gather information is underpinned by law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Information received by the scheme will be confidential and will not be able to be further disclosed or used for an unspecified purpose. Participating institutions will also be restricted in the ways that they can use protected information provided to them from the scheme operator. Misuse or unauthorised disclosure of scheme information may constitute an offence under legislation, with appropriate jail time or fines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To support the scheme, the government has committed $52.1 million over three years to establish redress support services to assist survivors. Redress support services will be available to all applicants, including specialised support for Indigenous people, people with disability, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Support services will be available nationally, and use face-to-face, telephone, online and outreach services to ensure coverage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will appoint experienced, independent assessors, known as independent decision-makers. Independent decision-makers will provide advice to the scheme operator on applications made to the scheme, and will not report or be answerable to government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In line with feedback from institutions, survivors and the Independent Advisory Council on Redress following the royal commission's recommendation, the scheme will provide survivors with access to independent and impartial internal review without subjecting them to potential retraumatisation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a companion bill to the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 (the national bill), which will establish a redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This companion bill provides consequential amendments to Commonwealth legislation in light of the scheme. For example, amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 will ensure the payments are not income tested and will not reduce the income support payments of survivors who receive payments under the scheme. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 will also ensure that the payments are quarantined from the divisible property of a bankrupt. This ensures that survivors can fully benefit from redress payments provided under the scheme regardless of their circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This companion bill will also remove external review mechanisms under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. These amendments will ensure the scheme remains survivor focused and trauma informed by being a non-legalistic process for survivors who have already suffered so much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This companion bill will also allow the scheme to access the social security system information for ease of administration and make protected information exempt from the Freedom of Information Act 1982, ensuring the integrity of the scheme and that that privacy of survivors and institutions is protected. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, this companion bill will exempt the national bill from the Age Discrimination Act 2004, which will allow the scheme to prevent children from applying if they do not turn 18 before the scheme's closure. This is to address the risk of children signing away their future civil rights when they may have limited capacity to understand the implications and to reduce the risk of monetary payments to minors being misused.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I start, I put on the record my appreciation and acknowledgement of the member for Watson for the bipartisanship which he showed in giving certainty to the two million Australians who live up and down the Murray-Darling Basin. That was real leadership and it should be acknowledged and put on the record. I also acknowledge the bipartisanship of the Australian Labor Party.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key objects of the Water Act 2007 was to promote the use and management of the Murray-Darling Basin's water resources in a way that balances environmental, economic and social outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2007 the Water Act established the Murray-Darling Basin Authority as an independent expertise-based statutory agency responsible for preparing an integrated plan for the sustainable use of the basin's water resources: the Murray-Darling Basin Plan itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Basin Plan involves the commitment of no less than four state, one territory and the Commonwealth governments, all working together to achieve the sustainable use of water across environmental, economic and social needs. Australia is envied around the world for its cross-jurisdictional water management arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, basin states currently face serious uncertainty in achieving this milestone following the disallowance of the Basin Plan Amendment Instrument 2017 (No. 1) by the Senate in February of this year. This has also widely been referred to as the disallowance of the northern basin review amendment or the NBR instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning now to this bill—the Water Amendment Bill 2018. The bill seeks to rectify the uncertainties that remain following the disallowance of the NBR instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will amend the Water Act to enable the NBR instrument to be remade and tabled again before parliament as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will introduce a new directions power to the act. This power will enable the minister to direct the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to prepare an instrument that has the same effect as a previously disallowed Basin Plan amendment. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority may not propose amendments to the previously disallowed instrument if they have not gone through the extensive consultation process under the Water Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Water Act already gives the minister the power to direct the authority in certain circumstances. The amendments to the Water Act contained in the bill do not grant the minister any extra powers in this sense.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The directions power will only be available for disallowed instruments that were prepared under subdivision F of division 1 of part 2 of the Water Act. This means, for example, that, if an amendment to adjust the SDLs (prepared, then adopted under sections 23A and 23B) is disallowed, it could not be remade using this new power.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, an instrument prepared by the authority under this new power must be the same in effect as a previously disallowed instrument.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will amend the Water Act to enable the outcomes of the crucial NBR amendments to the Basin Plan, disallowed by the Senate in February, to be given effect in a prompt manner. The February disallowance of the NBR instrument means we are facing increased time pressure to move forward with implementation of the plan. An instrument that gives effect to the outcomes of the NBR instrument could be prepared by the authority and adopted by the minister by mid-2018. This will provide certainty to basin states and communities as they prepare sustainable diversion limit (SDL) compliant water resource plans by 30 June 2019.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments contained in the disallowed NBR instrument were based on the best available science and data. They were recommended by the independent Murray-Darling Basin Authority following a series of reviews (the Northern Basin Review, reviews of sustainable diversion limits in three groundwater areas, and the 2014 independent review into the Water Act), each of which involved significant consultation with relevant community members, businesses and community organisations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the process of preparing the disallowed NBR instrument, the authority consulted at length with the Basin Officials Committee, the Basin Community Committee, Basin states, members of the public, including Indigenous groups, individuals, businesses and community groups.</span>

This will provide certainty for Basin states and communities as they work towards preparing SDL-compliant water resource plans by 30 June 2019. It is critical that the bill is passed urgently to enable the authority to prepare a new Basin Plan amendment instrument in time for these plans to be in place by 30 June 2019.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments through this bill are required because the ARC Act is the legislative basis that supports the financial operations of these grant programs. This bill will amend the ARC Act to update the existing funding caps and insert two new funding caps through until 30 June 2022 to allow continued funding of quality research in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new linkage projects were selected under the new continuous application process introduced as part of the government's National Innovation and Science Agenda. Now in its second year, this measure is ensuring that researchers and businesses can collaborate as opportunities arise, improving the time line for translating research into broader outcomes for businesses and the community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of detention, however, the committee has recommended that the provisions of the ASIO Act relating to questioning and detention warrants be repealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reaching this view, the committee considered evidence about the constitutional and human rights implications of detention. It also noted the availability of a range of law enforcement mechanisms that did not exist in 2003. The committee concluded, on balance, that the current provisions are no longer the appropriate response to the threat of terrorism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the committee has recommended that detention warrants be repealed, it supports, in principle, an alternative apprehension framework that ensures attendance at questioning, prevents contact with others, and prevents the destruction of information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, it became apparent to the committee that the existing legislation has become limited in its utility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has therefore recommended that the government develop legislation for a reformed ASIO compulsory questioning power, and has made a series of findings that are intended to guide development of this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reaching its views, the committee considered ASIO's preferred model together with the recommendation of former INSLM, the Hon. Roger Gyles, that a model based on that contained within the Australian Crime Commission Act be adopted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee concluded that while there are many benefits to the Crime Commission framework, wholesale adoption of this model would see the removal of some existing safeguards. The committee also noted that ASIO has advocated for provisions that are, in the committee's view, strong and fairer than equivalent provisions under the Crime Commission Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the committee concluded that the existing framework should be modified, retaining some important safeguards and mirroring Crime Commission Act provisions where appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will briefly summarise the committee's key findings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">First, the committee considers it appropriate that questioning warrants be authorised by the Attorney-General, as is the case for ASIO's other special powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Second, as I mentioned earlier, the committee supports, in principle, an alternative apprehension framework. However, an apprehension or compulsory attendance power should be limited to the power to compel the subject of a warrant to attend questioning. Any ongoing detention power must be subject to the discretion of the courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The committee also supports new provisions that would enable emergency authorisations, subject to certain conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">In relation to the examiner or prescribed authority, the committee sees merit in the creation of a permanent statutory examiner based on that in the Crime Commission Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The committee also finds that provision for the questioning of minors in relation to terrorism may be necessary, however additional oversight and safeguards are essential. Importantly, any compulsory questioning of a minor must be limited to those who are themselves the subject of investigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">The committee considers access to lawyers should be facilitated in line with the Crime Commission model, and there should be a mechanism to enable a person to contact specified persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">Importantly, all existing accountability arrangements in the ASIO Act and Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act should be retained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the question of whether the scope of questioning under a compulsory questioning warrant should be extended beyond terrorism offences, the committee has not stated a view. This is a matter that the government should consider in the development of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee considers that any proposed legislation should include an appropriate sunset clause and that this committee should conduct a further review prior to that date.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the impending sunset date of 7 September 2018, the committee has made the final recommendation that the ASIO Act be amended to extend the sunset provision by 12 months, to 7 September 2019. This should ensure that there is sufficient time for legislation to be developed and reviewed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30540" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BRODTMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  As the very proud and privileged member for Canberra, I am pleased to speak on the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 2017 today. When the average Australian thinks about this city's development, the following names easily come to mind: Charles Scrivener, Walter Burley Griffin, King O'Malley, Lady Denman and Sir Robert Menzies. But there are very few who know the story of how the National Capital Authority, responsible for the planning and management of Commonwealth land in the Australian Capital Territory, actually came about and why it has the responsibilities it has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901 and the eventual selection of the ACT to accommodate a capital city in 1908, surveyor Charles Scrivener was responsible for finding the city's specific site. Scrivener's selection of location, where Canberra is today, was guided by instructions to assess sites from 'a scenic standpoint, with a view to securing the picturesque and with the object of beautification'. With emphasis placed on the picturesque, it affirmed that the future capital's landscaping and aesthetics would be just as important as its functionality. It's therefore no surprise that these elements became the essence, the central theme, of Walter Burley Griffin's design for our beautiful nation's capital, our wonderful city of Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Burley Griffin's own design was strongly influenced by the design for Washington DC: Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1792 design. L'Enfant's design included wide, tree lined avenues that would visually connect significant topographical sites over the city. This became an emerging theme within the new city of Canberra, with Burley Griffin's design combining aspects, including the bush, which is very much part of our national identity and very much part of our Canberra identity. It is the bush capital. It's part of our DNA. We take great pride in the fact that we have big, beautiful skies, big, beautiful sunsets and views of the Brindabellas—although the Brindabellas can get a bit cool in winter when they're snow capped. We love our bush capital and we love that it's part of our national capital identity and our Canberra's identity. There are also the wide, tree lined avenues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Burley Griffin's design for Canberra became the cornerstone for planning and land management decisions, starting with the Federal Capital Advisory Committee in the early 1920s. The committee proposed developing the Burley Griffin plan in three stages: stage 1 would see the transfer of parliament and key administrative staff from Sydney and Melbourne to Canberra—ironically, it took until the 1990s for that to finally happen, and those opposite are doing their level best to deconstruct that; stage 2 would include the construction of railways in addition to other key buildings; and stage 3 would create character and permanence in the capital. While the first two stages were not achieved by the committee, the garden city aspects of Canberra were developed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon after, the Federal Capital Commission was formed to construct and administer Canberra from 1925. In its first two years, the commission oversaw the completion of Old Parliament House; the Lodge; the beautiful Albert Hall; the Institute of Anatomy, which is now home to the National Film and Sound Archive; the Australian Forestry School; and Mount Stromlo Observatory. With the onset of the Great Depression, the commission was disbanded, and there was no central planning for Canberra's development until the creation of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee in 1938. The committee was intended to oversee the development of Canberra, ensure the implementation of the Burley Griffin plan and maintain the high aesthetics and high architectural standards worthy of the national capital. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After almost 20 years, a Senate select committee inquired into Canberra's development and replaced the National Capital Planning and Development Committee with the National Development Capital Commission. The commission was granted significant funding and authority to complete the establishment of Canberra as the seat of government and was led by none other than the founder of the modern Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies. Sir Robert Menzies took some time to warm to the idea of Canberra as a worthy national capital. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I cannot honestly say that I liked Canberra very much; it was to me a place of exile; but I soon began to realise that the decision had been taken, that Canberra was and would continue to be the capital of the nation, and that it was therefore imperative to make it a worthy capital; something that the Australian people would come to admire and respect; something that would be a focal point for national pride and sentiment. Once I had converted myself to this faith, I became an apostle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was Sir Robert Menzies. Yet Sir Robert Menzies, through a series of bold and ambitious decisions, established Canberra as the thriving city we know it as today. Despite the fact he had that original reservation about Canberra, he became an apostle. He was converted to the faith that is our national capital—and it is a great national capital. He was also a very, very strong advocate of a consolidated Public Service here in the nation's capital, here in Canberra. I am sending this message to those opposite, particularly given that, as we heard on budget night, a number of government agencies and jobs are once again moving out of Canberra, our nation's capital. I again remind them of the Sir Robert Menzies's vision. I remind them to ensure that that legacy is upheld and that we have a consolidated Public Service here in the nation's capital, which was established to be the seat of democracy, and to have those servants of democracy based here in Canberra. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we get from the budget this week? We got more government agencies moving out of Canberra. The Inland Rail unit will be going to Toowoomba, Dubbo and Wodonga. The Indian Ocean Territories area of the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities is going to Perth. The Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations is going to Darwin. The Unique Student Identifier Registrar is going to Adelaide. There are a range of government agencies—that's not the full list—moving out of Canberra and into other parts of Australia. Again, I remind those opposite that, despite the Menzies vision, only 38 per cent of the Public Service is actually based here in Canberra. The rest of it is scattered throughout Australia, despite Sir Robert Menzies's vision to consolidate the Public Service here. This is the centre of policy development, and only 38 per cent of the Public Service is based here. I ask those opposite: how much more of the Public Service do you want to move out of Canberra, despite the fact that it was actually established to be the nation's capital and the seat of democracy? How much more do you want to decimate our nation's capital? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw what happened with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. What a debacle, what a complete and utter debacle—that blatant and shameless relocation from Canberra of 200-plus people to Armidale to essentially shore up the election of the former Deputy Prime Minister. It was a blatant and shameless pork barrel. The government commissioned an independent review into it. What did the independent review find? It found that it was all cost and no benefit. Despite that independent review and despite the Senate inquiry, the government still went ahead with this absolutely ludicrous decision, and it's been a complete and utter disaster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen brain drain of epic proportions. We've seen hundreds of years of expertise and skill leave the agency. It's gone and it won't be coming back. We've seen APVMA approvals for agricultural pesticides plummet. We've seen industry associations completely opposed to it. We've seen public servants moving to Armidale to work from McDonald's, because there is no actual facility for them to work from. They had this thought bubble based on no evidence that it was going to work, and they didn't even have a facility for the people who went there. You can imagine what's happening in the APVMA: people are leaving in droves, there is a brain drain that will be very hard to replace for many, many years, approvals are plummeting, industry is opposed to it and people are working from McDonald's because there is no facility to work in. This is the government's vision for the agricultural industry in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind those who are listening and those opposite that it was the then Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance who ordered this relocation, and the Deputy Prime Minister was, at that stage, the minister for agriculture. What sort of minister for agriculture decimates his own industry? That's what we've seen from those opposite. Their vision continues; the thought bubble continues. What is the cost-benefit analysis on moving these agencies and these jobs from Canberra to the regions? Where is the cost-benefit analysis? I haven't seen any cost-benefit analysis and I haven't heard of any. It was all news to me when I heard it on Tuesday night. I remind those opposite of Menzies' vision for this city, for this national capital. It was about consolidating the Public Service here, and it took a very, very long time. Some would argue that the project is still going, in that it took until the 1990s for DSD to finally come up here from Victoria Barracks. The project is still going on, and it's being deconstructed by those opposite, with this decentralisation nonsense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I go back to the bill at hand. In terms of this bill, we're talking about the planning and land management of the Australian Capital Territory, our nation's capital. We saw those opposite do their level best to completely deconstruct Menzies' vision. In the budget we saw next to zero investment in infrastructure. We saw further cuts—another 3,500 cuts to the Public Service, many of them here in the ACT—further attacks on our national institutions and, as I said mentioned before, decentralisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NCDC was disbanded in 1989, after the ACT was granted self-government, and the NCA was established. Since self-government, the NCA has shared responsibility for planning and managing land with the ACT government. The NCA is responsible for managing the Commonwealth's interest in the ACT, which is generally the tracts of land and other major assets identified as being on Commonwealth land or in nationally important areas. The ACT government is responsible for day-to-day planning decisions affecting the majority of the Territory. The existing arrangements do not provide decision-making within the NCA with sufficient oversight and transparency, nor do they provide the necessary support for the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes in this bill will update the governance arrangements of the NCA. The proposed amendment makes the authority the accountable authority, enabling it to give directions to the chief executive and allowing it to become involved in NCA operations. The amendment clarifies the relationship between the authority and the chief executive in a similar way to other agencies, such as the Organ and Tissue Authority. In this case, the NCA's chief executive remains the head of the entity for the purposes of the Public Service Act, but the authority for persons appointed by the Governor-General would become the accountable authority for the purposes of the act. These amendments also clarify the minister's existing powers by including 'must comply' provisions. These provisions oblige the authority to comply with the ministerial directive, which must be general in nature and not specific to a matter under the authority's consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the improved governance arrangements, we will see an improvement in terms of the transparency and the accountability of the NCA. That's vitally important, particularly for the people of Canberra. I've recently had a number of people from the electorate contact me about some changes to draft amendment 89, which is in the Deakin Forrest Residential Precinct. Despite the fact the NCA was engaged in an active conversation with a number of these residents in regard to changes to their planning plans and despite the fact that these planning plans were open for consultation, the NCA then sort of clamped down on making any further decisions, and these people, who were under the impression they were allowed to do a particular planning change, were then advised they couldn't do it, despite having engaged openly with the NCA for a very long time and despite the fact that the NCA had made that decision when the broader consultation process was still open. I encourage the NCA to use this opportunity, to use the changes from this bill, to actively engage in open consultation and not come to decisions on particular issues when they are still open to consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I thank the NCA for the work it's done in the diplomatic enclave with 'use it or lose it'. It's been terrific work in terms of getting movement and development in the diplomatic enclave here.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I will pick up from where I left off yesterday in the debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the related bill, with just some of the 490 NBN complaints that my office has helped our constituents handle. Yesterday I mentioned the 'You're not on the map' NBN problem. Today I will start with the 'It's somebody else's problem' NBN problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Abigail is from Blue Haven and runs a mobile locksmith business with her husband. When they applied to have their business connected to the NBN, their landline was cut off before switching, resulting in missed calls and lost business. When they asked Telstra to fix the problem, Telstra advised that it was not their responsibility and referred them to the NBN. Guess what? The NBN referred them back to Telstra—back and forth, back and forth. Then there's: 'Oops! You need a landline to operate your medic alert.' This one is really serious. As a pharmacist who worked in a hospital, I understand it. Of particular concern to me is the case of an 85-year-old constituent who contacted me because her landline had not been working properly for six months. This was particularly worrying, because, like many older Australians, she had a medic alert system which operates through her landline. When she tried to get Telstra to fix the problem, Telstra claimed it was an NBN issue, and NBN told her it was a Telstra problem—and so it goes on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not surprising, given that my office has handled over 490 NBN complaints, that yet again we hit the top of the league table in the TIO report. In the last six months of 2017, there was a reported 203 per cent surge in NBN complaints compared with the same period a year earlier and, all the while, the Turnbull government has been a bystander in my community. They simply don't care about people or small business owners who are struggling with this substandard service, particularly in regional areas. This is not acceptable for somebody trying to operate a small business. It's not acceptable for people relying on the landline to stay safe and connected in their homes. It is not acceptable for school students or people trying to do TAFE or uni. It just isn't working. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Normally, as a local member, I would be pleased to see a suburb in my electorate at the top of a league table, but, unfortunately, Toukley in my electorate is the top postcode in Australia for complaints to the TIO, and the main issue being complained about is unreliable landline services. That's not all. Wyong in my electorate, where I grew up, is also in the top 10 postcodes in Australia for complaints to the TIO. In this case, it is for delays in NBN connections. I will give an example. This is the case of Albert and Christine. This one is known—and some of you may know it—as the 'paperclip procedure'. Albert and Christine have had to endure the all-too-familiar ordeal of attempting to get answers from their service provider about the dropouts that result in missed telephone calls and crashed websites. They spent hours on the phone and were sent several new modems. They also became pretty handy at performing the paperclip procedure, which most of us know from being forced to reset modems over and over and over again. At least Albert kept his sense of humour throughout the whole ordeal, suggesting the NBN might stand for the 'No Bells Network', given their home phone rarely rang and most telephone calls would divert automatically to voicemail. While Albert and Christine's service was eventually restored, Albert noted that even the Telstra representative admitted to him that the copper network was so unreliable that he couldn't guarantee that it wouldn't happen again. This is what Albert had to say on the NBN:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a shame this current Government has virtually destroyed a brilliant idea but it is also extremely sad that the Post-Master General's Department was not re-established as the sole provider which would have been much better at organising a superior service for communications. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This can't go on, particularly in regional centres like mine where the NBN was meant to transform our community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is committed to a sustainable funding arrangement to support and improve NBN services in regional Australia. These failures of the current government have placed pressure on the sustainability of the future funding arrangements of the NBN. Labor supports measures that create a level playing field for competition in telecommunications. There were better and more efficient ways to achieve this than the bill currently before the House. However, we won't oppose the bill in the chamber today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the Prime Minister owns this levy. It is for the Prime Minister to explain why the government wants to give big business an $80 billion tax cut while introducing a new telecommunications charge that will add $84 to the annual broadband bill of households on non-NBN networks. It is for the Prime Minister to explain why occupants of new homes on non-NBN fibre networks will eventually have to pay an extra $84 per year on their internet bill. It is for the Prime Minister to explain why it is always the Australian customer and the Australian taxpayer who foot the bill for his poor judgement and policy failures. Regional Australians know that, when it comes to broadband, only Labor will be there to consistently deliver on their behalf. As we've done for over a decade, we will continue to put regional consumers front and centre of our policymaking. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  I'm proud to be able to support the amendment proposed to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 by the member for Greenway and to follow on from my friend the member for Dobell, who has so eloquently expressed a lot of the issues that we've been experiencing, particularly in rural and regional Australia, over this disastrous management of the National Broadband Network. This government has completely destroyed the complete transition of what was a clear, consolidated and efficient process to deliver effective broadband services to this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a little historical reminder of how we got to this point. We had 13 years of the Howard government where there were 18 failed attempts to do something about this issue, and nothing happened. Every year we slipped further and further behind not only our like countries in the OECD but also competitors, trade partners and countries in the region. If you look at the economic success story that South Korea has been, the almost 100 per cent fibre penetration of their industry and homes has meant a lot to their growth as a country. Here was an opportunity for us to achieve that final breaching of the tyranny of distance and overcome the final barrier towards the full economic realisation of the potential of this country, particularly in human resources in rural and regional Australia. So it was critically important. There were so many things that could have been spun off it—the benefits to education, the benefits to health for remote Australians, and, in particular, the ability for businesses in the new start-up space and innovators, who only needed good, sound broadband communications infrastructure, to be able to operate anywhere. That was the beauty of it. Particularly in a region like mine—sitting where we do and offering a wonderful lifestyle—if they had had that support, businesses could have been operating for the benefit of their families and local areas and not needing to be in one of our big cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A really wonderful example of that has been what Jane Cay has achieved with her company, birdsnest, in Cooma, because we have reasonable communications there. She established her company and grew from a very tiny operation. Now, she has been announced as No. 1 in the top 50 people in ecommerce by Internet Retailing in 2018 and winner of the Hot Innovator award at the Power Retail All Star Bash 2018. Birdsnest was voted as the fourth-best place to work in Australia for the over-100 employees category in the Great Place to Work awards 2017. She employs over 110 local women. There's actually only one bloke there. They have incredibly flexible, wonderful working arrangements, Google style, for women who have kids they have to take to school or who have something to do on the farm et cetera. It is a wonderfully inclusive workplace that encourages innovation and ideas from all of the workers. They're loving it there. Birdsnest was also a winner of the best online marketing initiative for their changing room service. If you haven't seen that, you should check it out—at least women should. It's has a wonderful set-up where you can go into a changing room and it has an iPad on the wall where you can mix and match your clothing and accoutrements. They'll then bring it out from the warehouse and talk you through it. Also, they were a winner of the best online customer service in the Online Retailer Industry Awards 2015-16. They show what is possible in a country town by taking advantage of good communications infrastructure. But that opportunity is sadly missing in the broader reaches of Eden-Monaro and, in fact, in large parts of our landscape. That was what the NBN offered us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came into government, we had a very simple three-technology approach to this. There would be fibre to the premises where that could be effectively and efficiently delivered. In remote areas or if terrain issues were a problem, you would have a mix of either fixed wireless towers or the satellite service. Labor commissioned the two satellites that are up there now, but it had been Labor's plan to put a third satellite up. One of the issues you have with services on satellites is that volume has to be managed carefully. Large volume on satellites will slow down the service. But what this government tried to do was create a multitechnology Frankenstein's monster disaster, which created a whole range of extra expenses and costs in the system. This bill, in introducing this levy, is a bit of a confession note to that. When we came into office, they were running with this OPEL idea, which some might remember. For Eden-Monaro, they put out maps of how this completely wireless service was meant to support Eden-Monaro. The only problem with their maps was they didn't take into account mountains or vegetation. I don't know if people are familiar with the terrain of Eden-Monaro, but we do have one or two hills. In fact, we have the Great Dividing Range right through the middle of it, we have Australia's highest mountain and we have a hell of a lot of vegetation. These maps were complete rubbish, and within 48 hours they had to be taken off the web. So the OPEL offering for Eden-Monaro would not have worked; it would have been a disaster. Nothing that the coalition put forward worked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came in, we had some major public policy issues to resolve. There was the structural separation of Telstra, something that should have been tackled long ago. We had to do the deals with Telstra and Optus on the arrangements for setting up a wholesale platform on which retailers could compete and the universal pricing policy approach to that, which was really going to benefit rural and regional people. On top of that, we had to ensure that there was a wider spread of fixed wireless towers so that there wouldn't be so much pressure on the satellite services and everyone would get maximum benefit from the new service. Obviously, the design of that system required building a slow development of productivity as that process got rolling. If it had been left in place, we would have been hitting high straps of productivity and speed right now, as we were really swinging into that. In addition to those big public policy challenges, we faced the discovery of asbestos in the pits around the country. That was no small matter. I personally know the hazards of asbestos, having worked with asbestos victims when I first came out of university. That was a massive challenge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is completely hypocritical and disingenuous of the coalition to have pointed the bone at us for any delays in establishing this massive new infrastructure project. It's been the largest in our history, but we got it rolling. There are so many problems that the coalition has created through its approach to this. One is that it severely underestimated the failings in the HFC capabilities that existed in the cities and the cost of even creating the software management of the system, across this Frankenstein's-monster mix. It's estimated to have cost well over $1 billion to address that issue. And how absurd and insane it was that they had to go out and buy another 15,000 kilometres of copper wire for this system—unbelievable, in the context of where the rest of the world is going!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The copper has been a huge impediment. I'm getting so much feedback from constituents that the fibre-to-the-node process is just not doing the job. The further you are from the node and the greater the number of people using it—it's like an elephant trying to push itself through a garden hose at the end of the node line. It's a disaster. Worse than that, there is now a digital divide in some places, like Queanbeyan, right across the border here. Half of Queanbeyan received fibre to the premises while large areas of Jerrabomberra ended up with fibre to the node. That has not only created poor services—and Jerrabomberra is a very tech-savvy community with a lot of small business people who would have made the most of those services. Not only are they missing out on that level of service; this digital divide has created a devaluation of their properties. People now come to Queanbeyan and say, 'Does this premises have fibre to the premises or is it on the node?' It is definitely having an impact on decisions people are making when buying homes in Queanbeyan. This digital divide has created inequity across so many levels through this crazy multi-technology mix that's been created by the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we're having issues with Sky Muster, as I mentioned. Every time I hold a forum in Eden-Monaro, we get a massive roll-up. This is something that's really burning in the bush, on top of the issues about the forced mergers that we've had. The anger in rural and regional communities over the coalition's attempt to protect the banks—rural and regional people were the ones who were most upset about this banks issue, and communications is right up there with those grievances. I would have 100 people roll up to a forum in Queanbeyan, and dozens and dozens of people in other towns around Eden-Monaro, to discuss these problems. There's a huge volume of correspondence, as the member for Dobell referred to; we've had the exact same experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Eden-Monaro in 2017, 33 per cent of all premises were only able to connect to the NBN via Sky Muster. That was well beyond what was originally intended. With that, we've had people seeking clarification on how the NBN services were allocated to certain areas. They can't get answers to those questions, because the government hasn't allowed the information on how they've been allocated to be released. We've continued to call on the government to commission an independent expert review of the NBN satellite service to set the record straight and provide a clear plan forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One really good example of how this has played out, if you need further proof, is that of the Barton Highway—and I'll be happy to speak more on the Barton Highway as a major disingenuous infrastructure deception that the government's committing on the people of the Yass Valley. The Barton Highway in Murrumbateman is presenting a great divide in NBN services. Residents on the western side of the Barton Highway are able to connect to fibre to the node, while those who are on the eastern side of the highway are only able to connect to Sky Muster. There's absolutely no logical, technical reason people can see for that, and no explanation has been given by NBN as to why there would be such a difference in technology based on this road border. It's just crazy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know in Eden-Monaro that we're under one of the busiest air routes in the world. They're offering up services under Sky Muster to those airlines, which is putting further strain on the services available to my community. It's been plagued with ongoing installation and reliability issues as well as higher costs compared to other NBN services. We had data limits as well, which had to be addressed. The feedback I'm getting from the community is continuing to pile up. If the government had stuck to our original plan of putting up three satellites, we would have seen a bit of an easing of the circumstances there, but we certainly need more fixed wireless towers to take the burden off the satellite. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the huge volume of complaints that have emerged in the TIO report in April. There has been a 204 per cent increase in complaints. Certainly I've been experiencing all of that, with people coming to me to try and get their matters sorted out. We really have to get this sorted out, because it's holding us back. Many small business people have also come to me about the limitations that have been placed on what they want to do as a result of confusion over communications infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is going to be a mess that Labor will be required to unravel, because it's very clear that, in all the history of the coalition's dealing with this, they just haven't managed to come to grips with it. I remember, vividly, Senator Helen Coonan. She was a wonderful lady, a decent person, but she'd been pitchforked into this issue at the end of the Howard government and she clearly didn't understand any of the technical aspects. It was a shock to watch her trying to explain the OPEL plan to my regional communities in Tumut and elsewhere. She left people completely unimpressed. This was in contrast to Stephen Conroy, who was well and truly over all the technical issues. In fact, my only issue with Stephen, when I took him to the communities, was to try to get him to tone down the technical language so that people could get their heads around it. He was completely across all this. If we'd stuck with the original plan, how much further ahead would we be now and how many gains would we have made? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember at the time that one estimate of the benefit of our original NBN plan to our economy was that it would have added $60 billion worth of value to the Australian economy. That's the kind of investment that we want to see from government to address our growth and our new economy issues. We've seen none of that imagination, none of that understanding out of this government. The only plan they've been able to put forward in all the five years they've been in government has been a tax cut to big business. That's it. Where's the imagination? Where's the creativity? Where's the approach to addressing the skills and workforce needs of this country to address the huge technology curve that's presenting this nation with problems? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of understanding that challenge, what have they done, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird? They've cut TAFE spending. I know this is a great passion of yours and that you've put so much love and passion into it and understand how important it is, particularly to rural and regional areas. We've seen not only the $3 billion worth of cuts up until now but this extra $270 million hit. We are seeing all this when we in our region are facing the challenges of supporting Snowy 2.0, which is likely to be developed. This will see another 5,000 jobs, but we don't want them hived off to 457 visas or skilled migrants from overseas. Our kids in the region deserve to have those opportunities, and our workers, our kids and our entrepreneurs deserve good-quality communications to support and give flight to their imaginations and their business opportunities, to make rural and regional Australia grow. That's how we do it—not stupid decentralisation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="123674" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McGOWAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  I would like to endorse the comments of my colleague from Eden-Monaro. He absolutely understands the issues that we're facing. I rise to speak about the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. I will be supporting this legislation in the House. If passed, these bills will establish statutory infrastructure provider obligations on NBN Co to support the ongoing delivery of superfast broadband services and will provide sustainable funding for NBN Co's loss-making fixed wireless and satellite services to regional areas through the Regional Broadband Scheme, the RBS. I welcome these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the NBN, I, along with many of my colleagues in the House, heard firsthand of the dissatisfaction with the rollout of the NBN. The dissatisfaction absolutely seems to be highest in regional communities. The purpose of the NBN rollout committee is very clear. Our job is to assess the rollout of the NBN and ensure that this significant infrastructure project for Australia is delivered in a way that delivers the social and economic benefits it promised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My office, like those of many members in regional areas, is acutely aware of the gap between the promise and the reality of the NBN. The experience of one of my constituents from the King Valley, a wine-producing and agricultural region 300 kilometres north of Melbourne, is a clear indication of this. I would like to read this into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>because I think it encapsulates the enormous frustrations that we're experiencing, but before I do I'd like to acknowledge the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government, who's in the House. It's lovely to have you here, Minister. I know that you understand this more than anybody else. Through our work on the House Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation you've just heard of the opportunities that we've got to face. I really look forward to working with you in your role to see what we can do about making sure all the regions and agriculture in particular have access to the internet that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's a case study of a business in my electorate. They had NBN Sky Muster satellite installed in November 2016. The telecommunications office has had a case file on the complaints since mid-November 2016, with no resolution. NBN contractors have visited the property on six separate occasions to replace satellite dishes, NTD units and cables to the house. Each instance resulted in the technician reporting to NBN Co and Ericsson, the satellite provider, that there was no internet signal. NBN continued to close each case, and each time a technician went to the property a new case was opened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Their ISP is iiNet. They have had two case managers at the TIO who have expressed their frustration in dealing with NBN Co. The assigned NBN Co case managers claim to have not had the emails sent by the TIO, even though the TIO have copies on file. The ISP seems powerless to pursue the case on behalf of the customer, even though NBN Co insists that the fault complaints have to come from the ISP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The constituent has 4G with Optus, which they say works well. They want to keep a wireless internet arrangement at home using Optus, but they've been told that they have to be on satellite, which eliminates other options. NBN claims that they can opt to retain their legacy copper services as well as, or instead of, switching to NBN, as there are no plans to switch off the existing copper networks in these areas. That has been a hard-fought battle. But this particular constituent doesn't have fixed copper wire to their property, so it's not much help. They want the government to give the TIO more power to compel NBN to meet requirements. Despite the many fault lodgements to NBN, NBN continues to dismiss the issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's not even the option to switch ISPs, because the fault continues with the satellite. There are only six providers to choose from, and my constituent believes that they've got dubious reputations. He tells me that the Sky Muster satellite ISPs do not include Telstra or Optus. The constituent tells me that he feels his hands are tied and he has been spun around like a yo-yo, with no resolution, as NBN refuses to admit that it cannot provide the capability for an internet service. This has affected the constituent's health and has been detrimental to the spouse's ability to work from home. They've agreed for me to put a ministerial into the system. They want the government to authorise on paper that he be allowed to continue to use his 4G for internet. It's just a comedy of errors—shock, horror! How could this be the case?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, it's not a one-off experience. My electoral officers constantly regale me with stories, saying, 'Guess what else has happened?' I know it's not new, but really we need to put energy into what we do about this. The strong message from my community is that the NBN is not delivering as promised. Their concerns and dissatisfaction with the rollout illustrate a lack of equity between metro and regional communities, particularly in relation to slow speeds. When people in my community try to address this, there is a lack of clarity of responsibilities between NBN Co and retail service providers. Ultimately, they turn to the office of their member of parliament for help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of my role on the NBN rollout committee, we spent 12 months meeting with communities across Australia, talking to businesses and local and state governments and taking submissions. In total the committee took 191 submissions from a range of individuals and organisations, 39 of which were from my electorate of Indi. I thank those constituents for playing an active role in this process, for engaging with me and the committee and for building the evidence base so that the committee can make informed decisions and sound recommendations. I have here the list of the 39 constituents, which I was going to read to the House today, but I think that would use up some of my scarce time, and I have more important things to say. But I want to acknowledge every single one of those constituents for the time and energy they put into putting their concerns in writing. Many of them turned up to the inquiry and actually spoke to their own issues. We do get that you are busy people, and I really do appreciate the energy it takes to work with government, so to every single one of you: thank you. I look forward to continuing to advocate in parliament so that we get a better outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn my mind now to the recommendations of the committee. There were 23 recommendations, but there are just a few I would really like to highlight, as I think they address the needs of rural and regional communities. I continue to call on the government to direct the NBN to establish a regional and rural reference group to support the rollout of NBN in rural and remote Australia. Minister, this is where you could really help me. When we put this recommendation up, the NBN said they didn't need a rural and remote reference group—that they knew about what was going on. Well, they might know about it, but I tell you what: their communication to the regions is not strong. I do acknowledge that they brought a roadshow bus to north-east Victoria and took it around many of the towns in my electorate, which was certainly a beginning, but there are so many issues that still need to be addressed, and communication back to my electorate and my constituents about how these are being addressed is really needed. So one of the recommendations is that we set up a reference group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has seen really clearly there needs to be greater consultation with rural and regional end users in the development of NBN user policy and NBN rollout plans. To the advisers in parliament today and to the people listening, I plead: this is really important and not an optional extra. Just saying that the telcos understand rural and regional Australia is not good enough, because we don't have evidence of that and we think it needs to be done much better. This recommendation was accepted by the majority report of the committee. It went to the government, who came back with, 'No, we're not going to do it,' for no good reason. So I reiterate that in my speech today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that, if you could set up such a reference group, the group would include consumer advocacy groups and departmental representation from the communications and regional development areas. It would be a really important step in improving the end user experience and increasing transparency. It's easily done, with huge output. I can't see why we wouldn't agree to it. When business decisions fundamentally change, the NBN experience for the end user in regional and rural communities should be referred to the reference group for consideration and analysis as to whether the decision will result in NBN not meeting its responsibilities outlined in the statement of expectations. When changes happen with NBN, you really need to consult with your regional users and say: 'How is this going to impact on you? Is this actually going to work, yes or no? What's a communication plan we could put in place to actually make it work better?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also called for a clearly identified complaint-handling process which would include complaint resolution processes and time frames and complaint acceleration processes, internal and external, and would meet Australian government accessibility guidelines. It should not be hard to do that. We've been hearing about the problems with the TIO. They say, 'It's not us.' Why couldn't we set up something very specifically to meet the needs for rural and regional Australia? You've heard today that we've got special and quite different needs to the city people. If we could have a process where our needs were met directly and quickly, I could say that you would be a friend of every single regional member of parliament, because it would take the huge workload off our officers and it would be really appreciated by constituents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know we have a helpline, but it's not targeted specifically to rural and regional, and we don't get a sense that our particular issues are being addressed in the right way. We have seen that there are significant inadequacies in resolving customer complaints—notably, a lack of direct access to the NBN and a gap in the knowledge of available avenues for complaints and dispute resolution. Whilst these issues cost wholesale and retail providers, there is a need for a single agency to provide this information to ensure the uniformity and consistency of messages and advice. If the minister and advisers would like to meet with staff in my department, I would be really happy to sit down with them and talk about the complaints that we get and how this recommendation could be worked to resolve some of the issues in a speedy way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get to the end of my talk, I would like to address my comments to agriculture and rural and regional development. In doing so, I want to acknowledge the enormous difference that the NBN has actually made to my community. My speech so far has mostly been about the problems, but, truthfully, it is a most wonderful, essential service that is going to be such a game changer for communities like mine. Where it's working—and working well—it has made a huge difference, so it's fantastic to have. I refer to an experience that the minister and I had as part of the inquiry into regional development. We went to Launceston, in Tasmania, and also to Geraldton, in Western Australia. We heard from both of these cities, which are gigabit cities; they've got infinite internet. The envy that it evoked in the rest of us, because we don't have that and we put up with such substandard—it was like dirt road problems. These two cities can advance because they've got the capacity to do it. It unleashed, I think, in all the people on our committee, an understanding of the opportunities from this technology for rural and regional Australia—and our frustration that we have to come to parliament and argue to get the changes made, as opposed to being on the front foot and being able to bring all our resources to work with the Department of Communications and the Arts, NBN Co and the TIO to actually sort out and solve the problems—because of all the benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the cities will benefit, but, in seeing what Launceston and Geraldton were able to do and the enormous optimism that those cities have because they've got such good internet, I could imagine that in my communities. We have so much potential to produce more. Fifty per cent of the water in the Murray-Darling Basin falls in my electorate. We could do so much. We could triple our agricultural production. We could triple our manufacturing. We're on a main transport route. We could do so much with 21st century agriculture if we could get hold of this technology. I've had the opportunity to go to Armidale, to the University of New England, to see what their smart farms are doing for agriculture. It is so exciting to see the research, but at the moment we can't bring that to our electorate. I can't bring that to my farming, manufacturing and stock and station agents, because we don't have the capacity. I'm here in parliament asking for basic services rather than being able to say, 'Let's work together to do what we can.' I'll be supporting this legislation. It is a good beginning, but we've got a long way to go. I offer the support of myself, my offices and my community to see if we can get over the hump and deliver what we know the potential of this technology is.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  It is a great pleasure to contribute to the debate today on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017. I want to build on some of the comments the member for Indi has made. She is an incredibly passionate advocate for her community, as all of us in this chamber understand and acknowledge. She is talking about potential here, and that just frustrates me in this debate about the National Broadband Network, because in the electorate of the member for Indi and in the electorates of other members in this House, and certainly in my electorate, we know that we have businesses and innovative, smart people—scientists—who could be doing so much more, who could be taking their innovation and their knowledge right out to the farthest corners of the globe, but they're stymied, and it is frustrating. Deputy Speaker, I'm sure you experience this in your community when you talk to people there. I've spent a lot of time talking to farmers on this issue, and they tell you they could build much better and bigger businesses, but they can't upload receipts onto their computers so that they can pay their bills. I've talked to farmers who actually have to get up in the middle of the night to do their accounting, because that's the only time at which their internet will work fast enough for them to download the things they need for doing their accounting. Every time I engage in this debate about NBN, it is always in the context of missed opportunities. I'm happy to have a discussion today about some of the technical things. As the member for Indi said, we are talking about pretty basic standard services here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing for Labor MPs and other MPs to engage in this debate, because we know what could have been. The truth is that Labor had a better plan for this. That plan would have delivered fibre to the home to 93 per cent of Australians. That plan was going to cost a lot of money—no-one can deny that. I would point out that the coalition's plan—their half-baked effort—has cost a lot of money, too. Labor's plan would have cost a lot of money and it would have taken a long time to do, but, as our friend Tony Windsor says, 'You do it once, you do it properly, you do it with fibre.' We had a plan that would be coming to completion right now, and all of my constituents and almost all of the member for Indi's constituents—I'm assuming, as it depends on whether the satellite was going to be connected to her area—would have had a broadband connection. That broadband connection would have had a fundamental difference to the coalition's plan in the way it has connected Australians up to broadband—that is, it would have been futureproof.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when we lay fibre under the ground we can continue to upgrade the technology that sits at either end, the technical electronics that help us to connect to the internet, but fibre is what's needed as a starting point. That's what we've missed out on. That's why the member for Indi's constituents, the member for Chifley's constituents and my constituents are not able to build the innovative businesses they could, because they are struggling with an internet that frankly is just not good enough for a First World country like Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here to talk about some of the technical aspects of how the NBN is being regulated. I will go those issues, which are in the context of this extraordinarily frustrating public discussion on where we have ended up with a second-rate NBN. I feel that not a week goes by in which another scandal or another issue does not come up, whether it be about the fact that speeds are lower than expected, that the internet is more expensive or that it is less reliable. A lot of people in my community—and I will speak about their experiences specifically—are telling me that after signing onto the NBN they have an internet service today that is more expensive, less reliable and slower than it was when they had an ADSL connection. It's pretty frustrating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention a recent report that I found incredibly disturbing. There are organisations that rank internet speeds around the world. The last report from one organisation, Speedtest, found that Australia has dropped to 55th in its global ranking of internet speeds. This is an incredible report and I would encourage those of you listening to look at it. The report lists countries like Lithuania, Latvia, Barbados, Thailand, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Moldova, Estonia, Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine and Uruguay—I could list 56 countries before I get to Australia. We have an average download speed of 29.5 megabits per second. The fastest country in the world is Singapore, which has an average download speed of 174.94 megabits per second.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, it is not a mystery as to why we are 56th in the world and Singapore is No. 1. Those of us who have been following this debate will be able to tell you why Singapore has a high internet download speed, and that is that Singaporean residences have fibre to the home. It is a real illustration of how badly wrong we have got this. We are seeing that the countries in the world that made the big one-off investment up-front in building fibre to the home are the countries that are leading the world in internet speeds, while the system that we've cobbled together with the different mix of technologies and the 'one street with one type of technology and the next street with another' approach is seeing us decline. We are getting worse over time, not better. There are all the other issues that I've talked about, as well as the expense and the issues around reliability.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will speak briefly about the Statutory Infrastructure Provider scheme. The bill that is before us goes into a bit of detail about some changes that will be made. I've talked a lot about the government's failures on the National Broadband Network, but I'm happy to admit when the government gets something right. It's not all that often that I have to make that concession, so I'm happy to do so now. </span>

                    </a>  Exactly. I'm glad to see that the government will be putting the principle that all Australians should have access to a high-speed broadband connection into legislation, for what it's worth—as they say on the internet. It is a sensible extension of the reform that Labor started while in government, with the statement of expectations that we provided for the NBN Co. That statement required NBN Co to ensure that the network was available to all Australians, and the bill before us means that this principle will continue beyond the completion of work. It is a sensible reform, and I think the least we could expect. Given that we've got the NBN so badly wrong, we should at least have regulation that allows people to have that sense of certainty. It is a bit disappointing to see how long it took the government to get to this position and to realise that this was an important principle, but we've been campaigning for this for some time and it is great to see the government join us on that and we can have a bipartisan approach on at least this small element of the scheme. Perhaps it might be wishful thinking on my part, but if the government had moved ahead on this principle a little bit earlier then maybe we would have also seen them admit their mistake in trying to use old technologies for the NBN rollout, because that's the issue of controversy between the two big political parties in this country that needs us to get to a bipartisan position. We simply can't continue under the current constraints. It is not good enough for a First World economy, and we need to do better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and his government told us that they were scrapping the rollout of Labor's fibre-to-the home technology because it cost too much. That probably sounded like a good political exercise at the time, but I have to say today that I think most Australians would agree it would have been much more sensible, much more beneficial, to pay a bit more at the time and get internet that was going to last us beyond this current iteration of technologies. What we've also seen is that the cost of the Prime Minister's NBN has blown out to $4 billion more than the cost of Labor's fibre NBN. So we are back again at this incredible frustration—and I'm just reflecting what I hear from my constituents—of having thrown billions of dollars at this problem, but, because we've done it in this cobbled-together way, because we've had this irritating policy change between Labor and Liberal, we've ended up with an internet that is slower, more expensive and less reliable than it otherwise would have been. Indeed, a lot of my constituents are having slower, less reliable and more expensive internet than they had before their NBN was connected. You just can't believe how frustrated people are about this, Deputy Speaker. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spent a lot of time talking to my constituents about the issues that they are having, because my goal is that an incoming Labor government will try to do something to help fix some of these issues. I've got large parts of my electorate which have not been connected at all to the NBN and in the parts which have been connected there are huge complaints about what's going on. We have received so many complaints about the NBN that we have actually had to set up a survey to collect them all. I want to talk about some of the comments that I've received from my constituents. The first is from Debra in Moorabbin. She said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We've gone backwards in this house for speed and connectivity. NBN often drops out and speeds are sometimes like old dial up. It's so frustrating. We rarely do work at home as a result. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tracey in Dingley Village describes Turnbull's NBN as 'an exorbitant waste of money invested in backward technology'. I couldn't agree with you more, Tracey. Andrew from Oakleigh South, like many, has had problems with the installation process. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Excuse my French, Deputy Speaker. That was a direct quote, telling it like Aussies do. I'll end with Matthew in Cheltenham, who said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure you that these comments go on and on and on. Among the many people who responded to our survey and those I have talked to about their NBN, I would say there is almost universal frustration and dissatisfaction with the service that is being provided. In the survey work that we did in my electorate, we found that 77 per cent of those connected to the NBN in Hotham are either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the network. Of those not yet connected to the NBN, 84 per cent don't want the old copper and cable technology that's planned for them; they want Labor's fibre connection straight to their home. In Hotham—and no surprise here—the vast majority of people connected to the NBN who are unsatisfied have HFC or FTTN. Those are the Prime Minister's old technologies that he cobbled together. It's meant to be called 'broadband'; they call it 'fraudband', and this is why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just people in my electorate who are upset and frustrated by this. Poll after poll and survey after survey show us that Australians are fed up with the inferior NBN. They're fed up with the customer service that they're receiving from the organisations. They are fed up and frustrated with the poor speeds. They are fed up with poor reliability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's NBN is a failure. He should have done it once and done it with fibre. He could have done that. As a country we are paying a colossal price for the mistake that was made in choosing to cobble together technologies instead of doing it properly with fibre. We don't want a second-rate NBN that costs more and does less. I think it's time that the Prime Minister listened to the public and started to make a concerted effort to try to actually fix the mess that he's created, rather than going ahead as he had planned. Broadband isn't a luxury; it's a critical public service that needs to be done right. It's essential for the people in my electorate, it's essential for our local economy, and it's the least we could do as a government to provide them with this basic service. Many countries that have a much lower GDP per capita are finding parts to give their constituents much better services than we've been able to do. So I regard it as a failure of the government in a most profound way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now having to deal with the consequences of these actions. One of the concerns I have is with the implementation of an internet tax on 400,000 residential and business services on non-NBN networks. These are the same networks that the Prime Minister, when he was in the Communications portfolio, encouraged. It is the constant failures with the NBN that have led us to this debate in this place. You are going to have member of parliament after member of parliament getting up and telling you the same thing, Deputy Speaker. We have the same message for the Prime Minister: the technology that you have chosen and the way that you have decided to do this are wrong. It is not taking us in the right direction; it is taking us backwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, every year I get sick of having to look at survey after survey telling us that Australia, instead of leaping forward as we rightly should be doing with all of the incredible assets that we have in this country, is slipping further backwards on this fundamental technology. We had a so-called 'infrastructure budget' announced by the government a couple of days ago. What do you think matters more? Is it building a road or is it giving us a highway that is going to provide a foundation for the future growth of our economy? They can't get that right. I don't think that anyone looking at their record on the NBN would trust them to do any of the other things that are in that budget. It's good to have the opportunity to express the frustration of my constituents, and I've been pleased to do that today on behalf of the people of Hotham. Thank you.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  At the outset, what the coalition should do is rename the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. They should be renamed 'the coalition's chickens coming home to roost'. The particular bill we are debating right now represents all the failures of the coalition accumulated and rolling into this. When you get to a point where you need to charge up to 500,000 Australians up to $84 a year more on their broadband, that represents the combined policy failure of the coalition. We've gotten to a point where our download speeds in Australia are slower than in Kazakhstan. We have Borat broadband in this country. Kazakhstan is beating Australia. We fall behind the world standard. How did we get to this spot? How did we get to the spot where Borat beats us on broadband? I'll tell you how.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the chamber, early on we didn't need to legislate the importance of broadband, because it was in our hearts and in our heads. We looked at the coalition under John Howard—in the 19 times they tried to get broadband plans in place, they couldn't get it done. What did we have? It was patchy in terms of the rollout back when John Howard was the Prime Minister and Helen Coonan was the communications minister. It was patchy. It was dollar driven in that if you got good broadband it was because you were in a richer area rather than the general metropolitan area. If you were in regional areas you could forget about getting good broadband. There was no national network; it was all cobbled together based on a profit-driven approach of Telstra, back in the day of Sol Trujillo—a name we have forgotten these days. Telstra would put up plans for broadband rollouts with a rate of return way higher than the ACCC could stomach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It took Labor to say: 'No, enough's enough! We will put in a national network. We will make sure 93 per cent of homes are fibred up. The other seven per cent will get it through either satellite or mobile broadband—that's how they'll get their internet. We'll put that into place. Forget the almost 20 instances of failure from the coalition; we're going to do it right the first time with fibre.' Malcolm Turnbull, now Prime Minister, then shadow communications minister, knew he couldn't beat that model the way it was. The then opposition leader, Tony Abbott, had one objective: destroy the National Broadband Network. But Malcolm Turnbull, as shadow communications minister, knew he couldn't do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So all they did was engage in political product differentiation to come up with a version of the NBN. They could try and slap the sticker on it to say that it was the NBN, but they knew it was a dud. They called it the multi-technology mix, which is now dubbed 'Malcolm Turnbull's mess', because that's exactly what's happening. They moved from fibre. They rely on HFC, the cable broadband network that everyone was telling them was going to cost a bundle to upgrade to get even remotely near what expectations would be. They relied on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition always cheer mobile broadband blackspot programs as if that is the substitute for having fibre to the premises in regional Australia. They cheer because regional Australians will have access to data that is more expensive and not as universally reliable as that fibre connection. That's what they cheer on, but they don't cheer on rolling out fibre to the premises. We have seen this embarrassed, cowardly crawling. They said they would not support fibre to the premises, so it was fibre to the node, then it was fibre a bit further away from the node, and then it was fibre to the driveway—all inching closer to the homes. We said, 'Just do this right the first time,' and they refused to. They put in place this system that is turning out to be a mess.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the Prime Minister, when he was communications minister, teasing both me and the member for Greenway, saying he'd visit Blacktown, which is in part of the electorate I represent and part of the electorate the member for Greenway, the current shadow communications minister, represents. He was saying: 'Look at this! There are these HFC networks that exist—these cable broadband networks that exist—and these members of parliament want to push for fibre when they could just use the cable broadband network.' As my constituents say to me, the cable broadband network works fantastically at 4 am. That's when it works best. If you have a lot of people on it, it slows down—exactly what we constantly told the coalition when we were in government. This network is affected by volume, it degrades and it costs a lot of money to bring it up to speed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the coalition, like I said earlier, wanted product differentiation—they wanted to say that they were doing something different to Labor—they put this forward. So now we are debating a levy that will be placed on Australians to cover the cost. Why? The shadow minister in her contribution outlined why. It is because just to operate this inferior technology mix that has been foisted on us by the Prime Minister, who was then the communications minister, and championed by the coalition, will cost $200 million more each year and it will generate less revenue—$300 million less revenue. So straightaway you have a gap of nearly half a billion dollars—again this reflects the deliberate decisions made by the coalition on how they would mutate the National Broadband Network into this MTM, this multi-technology mix, that would fail to deliver for Australian consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, in August last year roughly 300,000 homes—220,000 of which would have been revenue generating—literally disappeared off the NBN plan. The capital expenditure forecast for the rollout is up nearly $1½ billion from the year before. Another $140 million in revenue is not coming back. So this levy is reflective of those failures that had been enacted by the coalition. That's what has happened. This is the coalition's chickens coming home to roost, and that is why this legislation should be renamed in that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition told us that they would deliver 25 megabits per second download speed for all households by December 2016. The minute they were in office, the minute they won the election, they said, 'We can't make that promise,' and they tried to blame us for it. Everyone was telling them it wasn't achievable but they still pressed ahead with it. They knew they could not do that. They knew that they couldn't deliver their NBN for $29 billion by the end of 2016. They knew that. So we now have a nearly $50 billion multi-technology mix, and questions are being raised about how much extra it's going to cost to build and how much less revenue it's going to generate. In the meantime Australian consumers suffer and wonder whether it would be better to go on the soon-to-be-rolled-out 5G wireless network. They're actively contemplating spending more on data through another system rather than use this mess of a broadband network championed by the coalition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That raises further questions about whether the network itself will face more of this slow drift away from it. People who should be using the National Broadband Network will be using a 5G network. The revenue forecasts of the Prime Minister's network will slip even further, so now they need to put this type of levy in place. If they don't, they'll be in a world of pain. The parliament has been put in a terrible position as a result of the mess championed by the Prime Minster when he was the communications minister. If we don't support this, it will put the NBN in a worse position. As much as we are uptight about the fact that people will be paying nearly $100 more a year for their broadband in those areas that are not on the NBN, to not support this would put us in a worse position. The coalition forces the parliament to support this because no commonsense proposition would have you put this network, which is already in a bad way, in a worse position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  Absolutely. Consumers should turn the coalition into a pinata, as the member for Whitlam rightly observed, because they have been let down. The speeds aren't as fast; the network's costing more; it's not rolling out in the way that they promised; it's not delivering the speeds that they promised—and now we have to pay more for it through a consumer levy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the architecture of what Labor put together, we had a universal pricing approach that would have seen the cities of the nation cross-subsidising the rollout and the way that the service was delivered into regional Australia. You know what? Australians wouldn't mind that whatsoever. They support the notion that, if you're in the city, you can support regional areas getting this rollout. They get it. It was ticked off. The ACCC ticked off on it. When it was ticked off, no-one ever thought in their wildest dreams that, after having that universal mechanism in place, we'd have to come back and put a levy on top of it. No-one would have thought that. But, because we have Borat's broadband being championed by the Prime Minister, that's what we face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, what does it do in terms of the economy? Last month NBN Co released a report. They got a bunch of consultants in to bring together a report called <span style="font-style:italic;">Connecting Australia: the impact of the NBN on Australian lives and the economy</span>. It was breathlessly reported. Guess what? Everyone in the country knew what having a modern broadband network would do for the general community and for business. NBN Co have to put these reports together, but not to convince everyone who's already aware of that; this report seemed more likely to be used to convince the government of the value of the network. We all know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I point out that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications. I was proud to be on the committee that you chaired at that point in time, when we visited the country and we heard directly from regional Australia in particular, who said what mobile broadband networks do and the value they create for the digital economy—for which I'm the shadow minister with portfolio responsibility—in this country. Everyone knew that, but now NBN Co has to spend good money putting these types of reports together to convince the coalition that getting this right makes a lot of sense from the economy's perspective and from the community's perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From people in the electorate I represent—Woodcroft had been stuck for ages. We finally were able to get them on the NBN rollout plan, and then that plan was torn up by the then communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull. It then got put back on, but only half the job got done because the rest had cable broadband—and they're now complaining about the fact that they have that. In other parts of the electorate I represent, like Glendenning, constituents are telling me that they're getting one-megabit-per-second download speed—in some cases, half. They were told that cable broadband would work and are constantly frustrated by it. Rooty Hill and Mount Druitt residents are telling me that they're experiencing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why I have a problem with that is that businesses in the CBDs of the electorate I represent in Western Sydney rely on a modern broadband network just as much as they'd rely on having a good connection to gas, water and electricity. A modern broadband network is fundamental for a business to run—and run at less cost—to thrive, to put people on and to create new business opportunity, which we see occurring when you do have a modern network in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the other legislation that's before us is all straightforward. Of course, the way in which you relate or deal with developers in the infrastructure rollout and some of the stuff that's embedded in this legislation makes perfect sense. The thing that drives us crazy is not only that there's been a distortion of what we thought could be achieved, what was possible and what should have been rolled out. Now, because of the deliberate mess made by the coalition on broadband, we pay for it economically because the country's denied opportunity; we pay for it socially because communities are frustrated by the lack of the network; and we pay more for it as consumers through the levies that are being advocated by the coalition. It is a complete mess. As I said before, it's not the multi-technology mix; it's the Malcolm Turnbull mess. We are paying for it, and these bills represent that failure. The chickens are coming home to roost as a result of those bad decisions made by the coalition.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I'd like to make a few remarks on behalf of the Greens about some of the technical aspects of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, but I'd also like to share with the House the impact on my constituents of the Liberal government's complete botching of what had been a good plan that was going to deliver some of the infrastructure that this country needs. Of course, Melbourne, being a capital city electorate, is home to many universities, knowledge centres and businesses, which are now suffering as a result. As to the bills specifically under consideration, there are some brief remarks I want to make here that will be expanded on when the bills proceed to the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, we would make the point that, if and when the bills go to the other place, they should be considered separately. We welcome the introduction of the statutory infrastructure provider obligations, which are set out in schedule 3, because they will start to ensure that all people have access to high-speed broadband. In our view, these requirements seem to be consistent with the Productivity Commission's review of the telecommunications universal service obligations. We broadly agree with the amended network rules set out in schedules 1 and 2. We strongly support the rollout of the NBN to rural and regional Australia and acknowledge the need to cross-subsidise non-commercial services. But, certainly at this stage, we do not support the implementation of the Regional Broadband Scheme as proposed in schedule 4. We would recommend splitting schedule 4 of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017 and introducing them separately. As I said, that matter will be pursued further—not here by way of amendments, but it's certainly something that we'll want to address if and when it goes to the other place, because it's clear that these two pieces of legislation in that sense are not related and don't need to be considered together. And it's important that we have the opportunity to debate them separately because of what's at stake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to share with the House the impact that the botching of this scheme is having in my electorate of Melbourne. Fast, reliable and affordable internet should be a right for everyone in Australia. In 2018, people shouldn't be left wanting quality internet for use at home or in a business. But our internet is lagging behind the rest of the world under this government. Our internet is slow. In 2017, Australia was ranked 50th in the world for internet speeds, according to the Akamai <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nternet </span>report. This puts Australia behind nearly all other wealthy countries. Our internet speeds are less than half the speeds of leaders like South Korea. Not only is our internet slow; it's expensive. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Digital Australia: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ation</span> report ranks Australia 57th in the world when it comes to the affordability of fixed broadband. That's why we need to invest in a quality NBN that uses the right technology. We think the previous government had the right approach to this. That's why we supported it not only when we were in a power-sharing arrangement but also in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this Liberal government has botched the NBN, and, what's more, it has done so knowingly. What makes me really angry is that we know what needs to be done. Experts and the community are crying out for fast internet and a rollout of fibre-to-the-premises technology. The Greens have gone to election after election with clear policies that would deliver fast broadband for everyone. With political will, we could've already been rolling out high-speed, affordable and reliable internet to everyone in Australia for years. But this government has deliberately chosen to cut corners and use second-rate, outdated technologies. The government knows what would work; it has just decided not to use it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker made a very good point: why have they done it? They've done it for almost no other reason than for the sake of political differentiation; they wanted to be seen to be doing something different to what the previous government had done. As a result, they have completely botched it. They've taken a plan that could've worked and decided to botch it for no other reason than political differentiation, and it should be remembered that the current Prime Minister was the architect of that—destroying something that could've worked and, instead, turning it into something else, solely to put a different party's sticker on it. As a result, people in Australia and in my electorate of Melbourne are suffering. They are suffering as a result of the government playing politics with something that should be seen as an essential service and should be rolled out for the public good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In today's Australia, just as we rely on being connected to our electricity networks and to our water and gas, we should also start looking at internet and telecommunications as an essential service. That's the way it has been approached for many, many years in the past. It's the way that we should continue to approach the question of internet access. But this government did not approach internet access as a question of the common good. Instead, it put politics above the public good and, as a result, we are all suffering. What the government has done will leave people around Australia, people in my electorate of Melbourne, worse off into the future. Because of this government, my constituents will lose out—and I say that's not good enough. Because of this government, many suburbs in Melbourne and elsewhere are only getting a fibre-to-the-node connection, meaning slower internet speeds and more cost to residents to connect. Upgrades can only be done at extra cost to residents. So the cost has been pushed downwards, and people are having to pay more out of their own pocket as a result of what this Liberal government has done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of this government, in my electorate—bearing in mind that my electorate is one of the smallest in the country—there are now a variety of forms of internet connection within a very small defined geographical area. So, across the road in some places and across some suburbs in my electorate, they're only getting HFC technology, which was used for people to get Foxtel back in the 1990s. That's what they're getting, that's what they're being sold, instead of having fibre to the premises. Because of this government, most suburbs in my electorate have been left waiting for connection. Residents in Ascot Vale, Flemington, Kensington, North Melbourne, East Melbourne, Collingwood, Abbotsford and Fitzroy North have been told that, because of this government's botched job, they'll face another six- to nine-months delay in getting connected. And, when they are connected, for most of them it will be a connection to an outdated HFC technology that will just not stand the test of time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This would all be bad enough if it only affected residential internet use, but the government's failure to properly invest in the NBN is going to harm employment too. Quality technology is critical to so many businesses, industries and employers, and nowhere is this more apparent than in inner Melbourne. Places like Richmond, Collingwood and Docklands are increasingly home to innovative industries, tech companies, start-up spaces and social innovators who depend on reliable and fast internet. If the NBN is slow or unreliable or it takes too long to get connected, employers will suffer or they will leave. This Prime Minister, who loves to talk about innovation and being agile, is on the verge of kicking out employers from places like Melbourne in the very industries that he purports to support, because they can't get decent, fast and affordable internet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government simply has not been accountable for any of these failures. Despite requests, I can't even get a map of the suburbs that have been hit by delays. My office has been contacted by Melbourne constituents who have had to wait for weeks or months without internet due to installation problems, and they've had to come to their local MP because there was nowhere else to go to get it fixed. You ask for a map about what's happening across the whole suburb and you don't get one. You have to piece it together by asking individual by individual, suburb by suburb, area by area and street by street.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am furious that my constituents and the businesses that operate in my electorate have been left in the lurch by this government. It is not good enough. This government is actively blocking the sort of NBN rollout that would bring us into the 21st century, especially in a vibrant capital city area like Melbourne. Imagine if we had governments that had the vision to invest properly and continue investing in this key infrastructure and provide it publicly. In the 20th century, governments built transport, sewers and utilities because they knew it was in the public good. In the 21st century, the government should be investing in the NBN in the same way, not making a complete hash of it like the Liberals are doing.</span>

The Prime Minister really needs to wear how he has failed. He turned up in Bendigo when he was the shadow minister for communications and he promised Be.Bendigo, the Bendigo chamber of commerce, that we, across the Bendigo electorate, would have the NBN sooner, faster and cheaper. Well, on all three promises the Prime Minister failed, first as the communications minister and then as the Prime Minister. There is his arrogance when listening to the people in the bush, engaging with the people in the bush and learning from the experiences so we can fix the rest of the rollout going forward. It is so disappointing that we continue to have delays and we continue to have problems with the NBN rollout.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give people in the chamber a bit of background about the diversity of the NBN experiences in my electorate, the Bendigo electorate, and why Labor support some of the reforms but we want to see others heavily scrutinised. We have quite a significant fixed wireless network in the Bendigo area. In the south of the electorate we have a number of towers and in the north of the electorate we have a number of towers, but the towers are not keeping up with the growth of Bendigo. The rollout under this government was so bad. Early on, Julia Gillard was the Prime Minister when towers were built in the north, around Huntly and around Junortoun, but these towers were not switched on until the 2016 election. People were trying to access the network. Retailers would sell people a product and then they tried to connect, but there was no connection—no connection whatsoever; they weren't able to connect. Only after it was made an election issue were the towers switched on. But it was a short-term fix and the service is very slow. Why is the service slow? A tower was due to be built at Mount Camel, near Heathcote, and it was never built, so the government is trying to link nine relay towers to one tower in Bendigo South. So, the further you are from the tower in Bendigo South, the slower your service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been inundated with complaints from people around Huntly and around Junortoun who have a slow and inferior service through the fixed wireless network. One particular resident—and I shouldn't laugh, but he laughed with me about this—actually has a tower. He hosts a tower—it's on his property—but he can't get access to the fixed wireless service when it's on his property. So that people understand the close distance I'm talking about: Huntly and Junortoun are suburbs of Bendigo; they are five kilometres from the CBD of Bendigo. I cannot believe that the government is still saying to businesses and households less than five kilometres from Bendigo—the second-biggest regional city in Victoria—that you have to cop slow, fixed wireless services or, worse, compete with farmers and compete with really remote and regional Australia for Sky Muster. It's unbelievable that the government is still not listening to people in the regions. It would just make sense to roll out more fibre to the kerb and fibre to the premises in places like Bendigo. With more customers on the fibre network you would have fewer customers on the fixed wireless network or on Sky Muster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the opportunity during this debate to raise a couple of other examples. When I stand up and raise examples in this place, NBN Co is actually listening. I will log a few service calls in the hope that NBN is listening and that they will actually act on a few of these. When I've had the chance to raise questions in parliament, when I've had the chance to raise issues on this floor, that's how I seem to get a reaction out of NBN Co, and that's definitely how to get a reaction out of the minister's office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This one will be of interest to people: La Trobe University. We are trying to be a university city. In the suburb of Flora Hill there is a blackspot, and they're told there is no allocation of any kind of NBN at all. It starts at the edge of the university—can you believe it—runs through Flora Hill and takes in a couple of streets. There is no node to be built, there is no access to fixed wireless and there is no access to satellite. It's where people studying at the university live. It takes in part of Keck Street and part of Curtin Street, and it runs all the way to Somerville Street. It's right next to this blackspot next to Bendigo South East College. If there is ever a place in Bendigo that needs access to fibre to the premises and to fast internet, it's right near the university. Yet it is in the too-hard basket for this government and it is sitting to the side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have Bendigo Fireworks, a small business being run from somebody's home. Peter Daley has spoken to me and spoken publicly about the pushback that he constantly gets about trying to connect to the NBN. Unfortunately his experience hasn't been resolved. He can't get access to decent internet, and it means the end of his business. He's been told by NBN Co that the soonest he can be connected is 2020. Now, he is not that far. Bendigo is a regional seat. He is in Strathfieldsaye, a growing suburb. His house is before the shopping centre in Strathfieldsaye, and he cannot get access to fast broadband. It has been a failure of this government not to run fibre to the premises, fibre to the kerb or even fibre to the node in his part of the world, and it will mean the end of his business if NBN Co doesn't step in and fix this. There was a response from NBN Co in April 2018. They said, 'Look, he could have access to fixed wireless, planned to be available in January to June 2020.' It is still not good enough. This business needs access to the internet right now. It's not that hard. Peter is in a regional city and can't get access to the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another constituent complaint that I've had is from Kelly Howard, who is running a business, Accountable Bookkeeping Solutions, from home. If we want to encourage women back into work, to be entrepreneurial and to set up businesses, they actually need fast internet to do it. NBN Co have said in relation to Kelly's case:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It appears the reason for the delay relates to a physical network shortfall. At this stage, it has been identified in the field that the network design is incorrect—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and that there needs to be a change. It's not good enough. If you know it's a problem, get the technicians out there and get it fixed. Kelly Howard and her business need it now. It shouldn't have to be up to me to raise this in parliament for NBN Co to employ people to fix it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">David has fixed wireless with unsustainable, slow speeds. He is one of our people living in Redesdale. He is living a little bit further from Bendigo, but, in saying that, he is living between Bendigo and Melbourne. He is less than 50 kilometres away—not that far from Melbourne at all. It takes him about 50 minutes to drive to Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about people in Woodend. A tower is not being built in Woodend. As a result of this government not building a tower in Woodend, the poor businesses and households of Spencer Street continue to have multiple versions of technology rolling out. Spencer Street is one that I do wish to highlight. There are some people on ADSL2, some people on ADSL1, some people who have been told to use satellite and some people who have been told to use a dongle. They will have absolutely no access to the internet. This is one street in one part of my electorate, only 45 minutes by V/Line to Melbourne. It's faster for them to go to Melbourne to do their work than to wait and sit at home and do it on their computers. That is the disgrace of this government when it comes to rolling out the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could speak for hours in this place about this government's failure to roll out the NBN across Bendigo. There are problems in Golden Square. There are problems in Eaglehawk. I am disappointed that this government will not listen to the community of Bendigo and our businesses and the fact that its rollout is now starting to cost us jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the businesses that I have raised in this place is Industrial Conveyancing Australia. The response from NBN Co was just unacceptable. They design systems. They are an advanced manufacturer. They've had contracts with Coca-Cola and with Qantas. When you drive to their place, when you turn left at Howard Street, you drive past housing estates that have either fibre to the premises or fibre to the node, but all this government can offer them is fixed wireless. If this government were serious about supporting our manufacturers, if it were serious about supporting regional Victoria and helping to unlock its potential, then there would have been funding in their budget for NBN Co to roll out fibre to the premises to every single one of our industrial estates and to every single one of our businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a smart city that wants to engage more. We want to build up advanced manufacturing, but, under this government, we are unable to. Quite simply, under this Prime Minister and this government we have an inferior NBN. It's cost $4 billion more to build than what was originally committed. It's delivered slower speeds—and I've highlighted some examples in my speech today. It is less reliable. Dropouts are constantly occurring. It is costing more to maintain. The skill level of some of the contracted technicians coming out is below standard. It's exposed more competition for more wireless. The cost of upgrading is greater. It's generating less revenue from those willing to pay. This is a real problem when it comes to what's in the bill that is in front of us, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017: because the government have rolled out an inferior NBN, the NBN is not going to make the money that was first forecast. If we had rolled out fibre to the premises to begin with, the original Labor plan, we wouldn't be in this situation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear report after report of NBN Co having to write down its expected revenue. We know that there are problems with the product that retailers are selling. We know that people aren't getting the speeds that they're trying to buy, and yet this government continues to do too little. This bill was late in coming to this place, and it needs more work to ensure that people in the regions will get access to the internet. It's really easy for a Prime Minister living in the inner city of Sydney and for metro based MPs to just dismiss this, but it is a real issue in the regions. In the regions, where people have no access to the internet other than Sky Muster or fixed wireless, we need to ensure we end the digital divide that exists. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge that, after I raised a question in this place, the minister's office and NBN Co did fix the issue for our 76-year-old friend who lives in Castlemaine. I want to repeat this story because it's one of hundreds across my electorate. Our friend is 76 years old. When the NBN Co contractor came out, they ran the cable for her new NBN connection over the fence, across the yard, under the bushes and through her bedroom window and basically put everything into the bedroom. She contacted my office because she could no longer lock the window. The NBN Co contracted technician left. After I raised the issue in question time, NBN Co did react, and they sent out a directly employed NBN Co technician, who had the skills and qualifications, who was able to do the testing and to fix the problem—and it was fixed within a couple of hours. It shouldn't take a question to the Prime Minister in question time to get an issue fixed. That was one of hundreds of complaints that I've received, and they are ongoing. There is a skill problem with the technicians and the contractors that NBN Co have engaged. There are people being exploited, working in these jobs, and the government needs to address this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, what this government needs to get serious about and fund is decent NBN technology in the regions. We need to start fixing these problems. There are far too many problems sitting in the too-hard basket. The levies, the charging, and how the government is trying to make the numbers stack up will not make up for the fact that we have areas around the university that have no access to NBN and that we have businesses who are being told they will get Sky Muster and not fibre to the premises. This government is killing productivity and connectivity in Bendigo in central Victoria, and it needs to step up.</span>

                    <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I know members of the government don't like it when we talk about the problems with the NBN. I know from when we moved detailed amendments to this legislation, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017, as the shadow minister has done, that members of the government really would have preferred that the NBN would just go away. It gives the government no joy and it gives them no great headlines. Really, they are like the rest of Australia: it gives everyone a headache.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addressing the bill I will first address the amendments proposed by the member for Greenway. After almost five years in power, it's absolutely crystal clear to everyone on this side of the chamber, and perhaps everyone in Australia, that this government is a complete and utter failure when it comes to the NBN rollout in this country. We know that the government has form when it comes to the delivery of projects and delivery of services, whether it be ripping $17 billion away from our schools and the education of Australian students, cuts to Medicare and hospitals and the rebate freeze, including $600 million of cuts in my home state of Queensland, or the attacks we are seeing over and over again on vulnerable pensioners across Australia. I don't have time in this debate today to talk about the $80 billion tax handout to big multinational businesses and the banks, which is the government's top priority. But, if there is one thing that leaves us in no doubt as to this government's level of incompetence, it is the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the member for Bendigo and other speakers in this debate today, and my office is no different to theirs and to other electorate offices in Australia, because I'm pretty confident residents would be sending letters and emails to every MP's office—every government MP's office as well—or would be visiting their offices or stopping their elected representatives in their local communities to show not only their anger but also their disappointment. I would say that it is a community at breaking point, frustrated at the second-rate NBN being delivered by the Turnbull government, which simply is failing them and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this firsthand because last year my local community in the south-west of Brisbane was at breaking point when it came to dealing with the NBN. Since I became the member for Oxley—since July 2016—I have conducted a number of public meetings and public forums across a range of portfolio issues of direct concern to local residents. The crisis meetings I conducted around the issue of the NBN were without doubt the largest of those meetings—some 500 people attended forums and meetings. I note the shadow minister, the member for Whitlam, at the table. He was able to attend a meeting of concerned, frustrated people from across the south-west of Brisbane who, on a winter's night, packed out a venue at the Jindalee Bowls Club. When I put on a meeting, I expect to put out a couple of dozen chairs and that I will get a little advert in the paper, perhaps. This meeting was like nothing I have attended as a member of parliament—350 people crammed in. They were worried and concerned and basically had had a gutful. They wanted answers. To their credit, the NBN turned up. I don't blame the professional officers of the NBN—certainly the middle-ranking officers, who are doing very, very well under very constrained circumstances. They are not the people making the decisions. My criticism today is not of the frontline workers; it is of the elites and the executives of NBN who, quite frankly, deserve a lesson in customer service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on record that, after that meeting, I wrote to the former co-CEO, Bill Morrow, on behalf of the community. It was one of the outcomes from that crisis meeting, because a delegation of businesses wanted to meet with him to discuss the frustrations and to work out a proactive way to fix some of the problems. Now, I'm a bit old-school. If the buck stops at the top then you are never too good to not meet with your shareholders or, in particular, your customers. So I formally wrote to Mr Morrow to say that I would organise an onsite meeting. Businesses members in my local community were prepared to pay for themselves to fly down and meet with the NBN CEO, to discuss these issues in person, to have a constructive meeting and to iron out some of these problems. They are reflective of businesses right across this nation. They are busy people, building capital and wanting to employ people, but they are failing to meet their deadlines, to meet their obligations, because they don't have a fast and reliable internet service. The was no response from Bill Morrow—nothing; no response from the NBN. When I followed up, there was no response. Either they were not interested or they did not care. Unfortunately, one of the spokespersons at the meeting said to the public: 'We don't talk to residents. We don't talk to the public.' They actually said that to a room of what I would say were 350 irate, angry people. It was probably not the right tone to take, I would suggest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, they are hardworking individuals. So, following that one meeting, I wrote to the minister, Senator Fifield, to say: 'I would like to meet with you to raise these issues. I would like to talk to you in person about a constructive way forward to deal proactively with these issues.' I give credit to the ministers of the Turnbull government who I have arranged to see on behalf of constituents to resolve situations. I acknowledge those ministers and their staff who engage with both sides of politics—but not this minister. That is not the case with this minister at all. I would be interested to see if this minister has actually met with any members of parliament—quite frankly, on both sides of politics. That's the kind of contempt I think this government has when it comes to rolling out the NBN, dealing with problems and constructively working as a community together. Maybe that's indicative of what's wrong with the NBN. When you have a minister and senior bureaucrats who are refusing to meet with Labor or opposition members of parliament, that's fine, if that's their strategy. They're not interested—fine. But not to meet with a delegation of businesses or even acknowledge them as a courtesy to say, 'Look, I'm terribly sorry, I've got a large number of commitments, but I'll make alternative arrangements'? I can tell you now that a lot of those small businesses were very disappointed in the way that they were treated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were community halls being packed out with story after story of residents just wanting basic answers, basic information. So let's just pause and take a look at some of the cold, hard facts when it comes to this government and how it has stuffed up the NBN rollout. What we know was supposed to be an innovative, nation-building rollout under Labor was immediately scrapped by the government, and, as we know, the cost to the Australian public continues to be damning. We were first told that the bill would be $29.5 billion. That increased to $41 billion in 2013. It then increased from $41 billion to $49 billion in August 2015, and then taxpayers were forced into a $19.5 billion loan after the NBN Co failed to secure private debt funding. Now we are here with this bill, with the introduction of an NBN levy. The government is leaving consumers to pick up the tab. It is telling that in the week of the budget this government is seeking to introduce a new broadband tax that is expected to raise nearly half a billion dollars over the next decade. This levy is expected to add $84 to the annual broadband bill for the homes and businesses on non-NBN networks that are subject to this tax. Estimates of the number of services that will be affected by this levy range from 240,000 homes to 450,000 homes. I don't blame anyone else but the government for this increased tax burden on Australians, but I am surprised that the so-called party of lower tax, the party that wants to get rid of taxes, is now introducing a tax on a service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When given the choice—and why would Australians choose to sign up to the Prime Minister's second-rate broadband if something better is on offer? In the Prime Minister rejecting fibre—as we have heard from the member for Bendigo, the previous speaker—we have seen a digital divide not only in regional Australia but right across the country, including in the south-west of Brisbane in the Oxley electorate. I know residents in my electorate in Mount Ommaney, Jindalee, Sumner, Forest Lake, Springfield and Redbank have had an absolute gutful of this Prime Minister's second-rate, second-class NBN service. I place on the record again: why should residents have to put up with slow speeds, dropouts or simply no connection at all because of the incompetence of this Prime Minister and the NBN mess he has given to almost every home in this country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now here with this government shafting Australian homes and leaving, with this bill, a new NBN levy. The proposed levy before this parliament is a direct consequence, I believe, of the repeated failures of this government. But don't take my word for it; this is what the former head of NBN Co had to say about the state of the project, particularly when it came to speed and faults:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the government promising users a minimum download speed of 25 megabits per second, Mr Morrow said that this would not be possible during the coexistence period, when other services like ADSL are still running.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This charade must end. We need some certainty when it comes to the rollout. We need better standards for those businesses and residents who have attended the crisis meetings I have held, the forums and the public meetings. If the government would just look at the feedback from residents—we know that the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman shows a more than 200 per cent increase in complaints. It would be a bit different if we could have some humility or contrition from the government, if they could say: 'We know there are problems. We know we've got a long way to go. We know we're going to work through these systematically.' Instead, it's always the same when it comes to the NBN: 'Nothing to see here,' 'Pretend it's all okay,' 'Ignore the complaints,' and, 'Don't buy into it.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you about a great small business in my area, a pest control business run by a husband and wife. He is looking at moving house because he can't do his books. His wife was studying and she had to go to the McDonald's cafe to access the internet so that she could do her online coursework. This is happening 13 kilometres from the CBD of Brisbane. When you ask for it to be investigated, the government says: 'There's nothing we can do; just put up with it,' or the normal rubbish that this government goes on with: that somehow Labor, within the first month of announcing the NBN, didn't connect every single house in Australia! That's the only response from this ridiculous government when it comes to dealing with the NBN. It never actually acknowledges the problem, let alone fixes it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bendigo was right. When it comes to fixing NBN problems, I've had the most success stories not from writing to the minister and not from writing to the former CEO of the NBN—do you know how? When you get a story in the local paper, magically the problem is fixed. It takes a little bit of embarrassment for the government. If you put the minister's name in a press release and bag them out, hey, presto, the problem's fixed. I'm not joking. If I am not accurate then I'll sit down now and members of the government can say that that's not the case. Time and time again, all we're seeing is spin over substance, residents being ignored and complaints through the roof. The evidence is simply overwhelming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Oxley and as one of the representatives for one of the fastest-growing corridors in this country, I know that access to quality broadband services is essential. It is critical for education purposes, health service delivery and making sure that people are connected to the businesses that they want to build and grow in the south-west of Brisbane. This is an issue that is not simply going to go away for government. This is not an issue about which the government can simply say, 'It's all too hard. Hopefully some other crisis will engulf us today and we can move on to something else.' I won't be letting this go. We will make sure that we deliver a proper NBN for this country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I rise today to speak to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. We find ourselves in an era that none of us could have foreseen. We can order our children's lunches from the school's canteen via a smartphone app; most of our bills are paid online rather than going to the post office, as we used to do; we can check the surf conditions through a webcam without even having to drive to the beach; and we can turn the heater on at home without even being there. It is indeed a time of wonder and innovation. I think back to my dad bringing home his pay packet, mum tearing it open and the money being there. It's just not like that anymore. It is a time of wonder and innovation bound by one common thread, and that is the internet—more specifically: high-speed, reliable internet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With each day that passes, education, health, our businesses and transport all become more heavily reliant upon this invisible wonder web that connects us all, unless, of course, you are one of the 60 per cent of Australians using the National Broadband Network who reported issues with the service within the last six months—that's according to Choice, the consumer organisation—or you're part of the 44 per cent who experienced very slow speeds, the 42 per cent who reported disconnections, dropouts and performance issues, or the 31 per cent who had problems in connecting altogether. We find ourselves in difficult times, attempting to keep ahead of the global technological wave while being weighed down by Prime Minister Turnbull's inferior NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are here today to consider two bills before the House: the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017. Labor supports the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and its establishment of a statutory infrastructure provider, known as SIP. A SIP would ensure that all Australian homes and businesses are guaranteed access to high-speed broadband. This may be provided through NBN Co or an alternative provider. This bill will enshrine in legislation Labor's long-held commitment to providing NBN services in regional Australia: the universal service obligation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Paterson, we have a depth and breadth of industries—some pushing innovation with emerging technologies, others re-examining their ways of working to stay relevant in a rapidly changing world. In each instance, the internet is the enabler. It's the connectivity, the thought-sharing, the fingertip access to a wealth of research. When you take all that away, the costs are far more reaching. Let me tell you about Bohemia Interactive Simulations. They're a small software business located in Williamtown, in our major defence tech park in my electorate of Paterson. The ability to both upload and download software is imperative to the operations of this software business. To do so in a timely and cost effective manner is crucial to what they do. To be able to grow and expand their operation, businesses need reliable, affordable and fast internet speeds, yet Bohemia cannot get access to the NBN.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bohemia are paying five times more by connecting through a private operator than they would via the NBN. This money should be spent on employing people, but they've got to pay more to do business because the NBN is not up to scratch. Ryan Stephenson is the director of Bohemia, and he says Bohemia cannot expand their operations because the speed of the internet just won't support it. He says Bohemia cannot employ more staff because more people using the internet would slow it down even more and make day-to-day operations even harder. What irony—not being able to employ more people in an internet software business because the internet's too slow! This is an example of how a substandard NBN rollout is stunting Australian small business. It's absolutely slaying that growth and innovation that our very own Prime Minister crowed and trumpeted about and told us we all needed to embrace. Well, it's a little bit difficult to embrace something that you can't even get hold of in the first place. And Bohemia's situation is in no way unique.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly I'm outraged that innovative, world-class entrepreneurs and industries that choose to come to my electorate of Paterson, which is at the absolute vanguard of defence technology, are faced with an archaic stumbling block that has the potential to jeopardise their entire operations. It is clearly not good enough. Bohemia's experience is the result of Prime Minister Turnbull's inferior NBN, which, incidentally, has cost Australian taxpayers $4 billion more to build. It delivers slower speeds than were promised. In fact, the technology is so substandard that in many cases it's incapable of delivering at the level it was sold at. It's less reliable. It's so unreliable that the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman has experienced a 160 per cent rise in complaints. That's 160 per cent! To put that in perspective, the banking and finance industry received four times fewer complaints—and there have been a heck of a lot of complaints about the banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unsurprisingly, many of the NBN complaints came from regional Australia—well, there you go. They didn't just come from businesses; they came from individuals, families, schools, even medical practitioners unable to connect with patients. In this era of technological advancement, a great many students are learning in a bring-your-own-device environment. Their homework is issued online, it needs to be completed online and it needs to be submitted online. What happens, then, if a child lives in an area that has substandard connectivity? How does it impact their grades and, indeed, their potential, and what of study?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can speak of my own experience. My daughter did the HSC last year. We used to have a family round table each week to look at what assessments were due, what was coming up and who would use which internet, because we're too far from the exchange to get ADSL and we haven't got the NBN where I live. We had to borrow dongles and figure out who would use what on the internet just so my daughter could achieve her Higher School Certificate. Clearly, this is not about me, but I'm just another example of the many people in my electorate and across Australia more broadly who are facing this problem. They're laughing—well, they're not laughing; I think they're completely dismayed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that adds injury to insult is the way the Prime Minister, who you'd be forgiven for thinking had invented the internet himself—and I'm sure he's quite capable in terms of things technological—was so caustic about Labor's plan to deliver fibre to the premises and how his model would be so superior, so much faster, so much cheaper. Well, none of this has been borne out. If he'd only had the decency to say, 'I'm sorry, but I really made a mistake on that, and we want to get it fixed up for you as quickly as we can.' But there's been no such backdown from the Prime Minister; we just see this arrogance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost a decade ago Labor initiated an important reform that led to a statement of expectations issued to the NBN board. This statement of expectations required that the company ensure all Australians had access to the NBN. It was fundamentally about the equality of opportunity for which Labor proudly stands. It was about making sure every Australian could access high-speed broadband, no matter where they lived or worked. It was a fundamental part of this new and brilliant technology, a little bit like the telephone when it came along. I am proud to be part of a party that fought to ensure we reached the point we have now, where the fundamental reforms of the statement of expectations become legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with the passage of this bill, however, we remain in a mess. Prime Minister Turnbull's NBN bears little resemblance to that which Labor planned. Fibre's been abandoned, and in many instances we have a $49 billion multi-technology mess. It costs more and does less, and it's four years behind schedule. In no way is the Turnbull government's NBN a first-class fibre network. The long-term economics of it are decidedly unsound. We have missed the greatest opportunity, and I weep for future generations, who really could have had something exciting—what this could have been, rather than the miserly expression of what it's become.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2013 the coalition committed to deliver the NBN for $29.5 billion and have it completed by 2016. What a load of rot—a bit like the rotting copper you've relied on. Between now and then, the cost has blown out from $29.5 billion to $41 billion to $49 billion, and the completion date has blown out from 2016 to 2020. Seriously, you should all hang your heads in shame. I don't know how you can come in here and gloat about it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Deputy Chair of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I must impress upon the Prime Minister and his government the importance of ensuring every Australian home and business has access to high-speed broadband. We cannot sacrifice the rights of our regional, rural and remote Australians, and that's why my colleagues and I today stand here to support the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017. The companion to this proposed legislation, the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017, is in some ways the bandaid that the Turnbull government is proffering to fix the broken economics around its NBN rollout. There is no substitute for the first-class fibre NBN supported by sustainable funding mechanisms that ensured sound long-term economics. However, schedule 4 of the bill is a way of ensuring that the NBN competes on a level playing field. This is an important market mechanism and can only benefit everyday Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The upshot of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 is that the Turnbull government will introduce a telecommunications levy. The Regional Broadband Scheme levy will add $84 a year to the bills of up to 400,000 consumers and businesses on non-NBN networks. That equates to $7.10 a month. The cost will rise to $7.80 by 2021. This is, in Labor's view, a regrettable choice. There were better and more efficient ways to achieve a level playing field. Under Labor's plan, high-speed broadband would have been extended to unprofitable areas through a universal wholesale pricing scheme. NBN users in cities, who generally receive higher wages, were better placed to pay more and would have helped cross-subsidise services in the regions, which incur a higher cost. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With Turnbull's second-rate NBN, nearly one in two customers on the copper NBN were paying for plans the network could not deliver. They've been compensated but will not be able to achieve those high speeds or pay for them under the existing technology. But the government's economic plan assumes uptake of and payment for those high-speed plans, plans that would require an upgrade from the current copper footprint for which—surprise, surprise!—there is no funding set aside. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Turnbull's decision to bet on copper has undermined the entire economic plan of the NBN. It's been a liability for broadband consumers and for Australian taxpayers. This places pressure on the sustainability of the funding arrangements for the NBN. That in turn has the potential to jeopardise the services that NBN Co can provide to Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hastie, NBN Co is required to provide broadband in areas that are unprofitable to service. No other provider shares this obligation. That means NBN fixed-line competitors can target low-cost, high-profit areas in the NBN footprint, in places like apartment buildings and central business districts, and leave the tough stuff—the regions—to NBN Co.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, Labor considers it essential that all Australians have access to fast, reliable broadband. Considering all that is at stake, we support the Regional Broadband Scheme. We consider it to be appropriate that the costs of regional broadband are shared among companies who choose to compete directly with the NBN. But make no mistake, this entire NBN mess will go down as one of the great travesties and shames of this time in Australia.</span>

I'm always happy to speak on the NBN, as members in this House would well know. The NBN has, sadly, been a source of constant anguish for my constituents. Whether it's trying to force 21st century technology down 1950s and 1960s copper wiring in the suburbs of Rockingham, Shoalwater and Safety Bay, trying to fix a botched installation down in Port Kennedy or even just trying to get a signal out in Baldivis, in the east of my electorate, my constituents are always very happy to give feedback to Prime Minister Turnbull on his government's 'fraudband' rollout, just as I'm always happy to rise in the parliament to speak about it. Indeed, my colleague and friend the shadow minister for communications, the member for Greenway, had a chance last year, on one of her many visits to Western Australia, to hear from residents in my electorate on their concerns about the National Broadband Network and the rollout in their district. It would appear, from piles and piles of correspondence to my office on this issue, that residents in Brand would do just about anything to be able to access the internet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, internet access is as much a universal right as the right to education or the right to social equality. Indeed, access to the internet and its services bridges the gap between rich and poor, the haves and the have-nots, and is responsible for so much of the world's technological advances over the past 20 years. Everyone in my electorate, indeed Australia-wide, deserves to be able to use this technology and access the internet safely and reliably. To this end, we'll be supporting these bills. I'll support anything that seeks to improve the services available to my constituents. However, I will also be supporting the amendment of the member for Greenway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the substance of the bills, we can see their necessity, as well as the necessity of other amendments. The Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 established a universal service obligation that nailed down the need for an easily accessible standard telephone service for all Australians. The problem with that is the date—21 years of technology growth, expansion and innovation has outgrown the act and its perfectly well-meaning intentions. Consumer needs have shifted dramatically away from a basic phone service, moving instead towards internet connectivity, although a basic phone service is essential for many in our community—and I will reflect on an instance I have witnessed myself of the inability of our providers to provide even a basic phone service to the elderly. In this digital age, it's perfectly reasonable that many services have gone online. You can pay car registration, power, insurance and other bills online. Gone are the days of going into an office or even ringing up your insurance company or utilities provider to pay your bill. But we must be mindful that this digital transformation does not move too fast and leave the most vulnerable behind, particularly the seniors in our community. Universal access may be a right, but so is the right to be included, the right to be educated and the right to transition at a reasonable pace. Others can transition as fast as they like, but we must ensure that those who find it difficult to cope with new technologies are helped along the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands these needs, which is partly why the NBN was envisaged in the first place, the other part being, of course, that former Prime Minister John Howard had no foresight on broadband policy, and the Nationals, as usual, achieved very little in this regard. When it was first established under Labor, the NBN was the first initiative of any Australian government that provisionally guaranteed universal broadband access. This was implemented through a statement of expectations issued to the NBN board at the time. Whilst this was a good start, we have seen that since Labor left government much of this goodwill has unfortunately been sucked down the drain of political pointscoring by some who choose to cut corners in the name of cutting costs and lowering expectations in a policy they never truly believed in. Despite this, it is good to see the bill presented as another step in the right direction as it seeks to establish a Statutory Infrastructure Provider regime that makes sure that all Australian premises are guaranteed access to high-speed broadband through NBN or another infrastructure provider in certain circumstances. This places universal broadband access into federal legislation and helps provide certainty to metropolitan and regional consumers beyond the scope of the initial NBN broadband rollout. This is sorely needed in my electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have heard terrible stories about the lack of access in my electorate and how it is impacting on the daily lives of the decent, hardworking people across Rockingham and Kwinana, as well as many others around Australia. There are people like Mr Dewald Pretorius, who works from home in his own small business and requires the internet to do so. Mr Pretorius told me that he had better internet connections in Africa than he does in Baldivis. How is that possible in a purportedly modern Australia and in an outer metropolitan area of Perth? It's unacceptable. Another is a doctor in Port Kennedy who works from home in the area of aged and palliative care. He looks after 200 residents in aged-care facilities. His practice is fully computerised, relying on internet connectivity to ensure communications, medication orders and test results—to name just some areas of his work. But how can these services be met and dealt with in an accurate and timely manner when he doesn't have access to a guaranteed stable internet service? In fact, according to the official NBN rollout map, some parts of Port Kennedy, which is in the southern part of my electorate, will not be connected to the broadband until June 2019—more than a year from now. This is just another example of how denying the right of access to internet service can impact on other rights, like the right to health care and health services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have quite often stood in this place to question the government on their approach to the whole National Broadband Network project. They have been there five years and have failed to make much progress. To say that they are delivering when they simply are not is ridiculous. The appalling and inadequate rollout of the NBN has reached such dire proportions that now, just like walking through a clean house with muddy shoes, someone has to go back and mop it up. This mop and bucket takes the form of a new broadband tax of $7.10 per month. It will apply to services on non-NBN networks. This charge is due to increase by $7.80 by 2021. The government's internet tax, which they are cleverly calling a 'levy', is expected to add $84 to the annual bill of up to 400,000 residents and business services on non-NBN networks. Let us be clear about this: the only reason we find ourselves at this point is the Prime Minister's poor judgement at every turn in this very important policy area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional and remote coverage of the NBN was an important Labor initiative when the NBN was started. It was a decision to extend high-speed broadband to unprofitable areas and fund it through a universal wholesale pricing regime across the country. This meant that NBN users in the city could help cross-subsidise higher-cost services in the regions. There was no contemplation of having a universal wholesale pricing regime and a levy. It was supposed to be one or the other, but not both. The decision by the Turnbull government to slug consumers with a new internet tax is both poorly designed and clearly a stopgap solution. The $49 billion 'multi-technology mix' has cost more and achieved less. It doesn't even generate as much revenue as the original plan. The coalition had a 2013 commitment to deliver the NBN by 2016 at a cost of $29.5 billion. What a joke that commitment was! In late 2013, this blew out to $41 billion and in 2015 by another $8 billion. It's now 2018 and the project isn't slated to be completed until 2020, at a cost of $49 billion to the taxpayer. That is $20 billion over budget and four years behind. It's hard to fathom how the promise of the now Prime Minister when he was Minister for Communications could go so wrong, but it has gone wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017 many Australian retail service providers were caught selling speed plans that the NBN could not possibly deliver with a high percentage of copper in the general infrastructure. This resulted in nearly one in two consumers who were on the copper NBN paying for the top speed tier and having their speeds downgraded. They were compensated as a result of the inquiry via the ACCC and assisted by the NBN parliamentary committee. In that regard, I would like to thank the now former member for Fremantle for his diligence on the issue while sitting on the committee. As he points out, Western Australia will continue to receive the bulk of the rotten multi-mix technology this government is pushing out. It was reported that one in three homes on copper cannot achieve 50 megabits per second, and three in four cannot achieve 100 megabits per second, which is far below what was promised by NBN under this government. And yet we have also learnt that no funding has been set aside in the government's NBN business case out to 2040 to upgrade its copper footprint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will turn for a moment to a pretty personal story about the NBN and the problem with the copper wiring, its current rollout and the fragility of the infrastructure we had in place. On 22 April, there was a storm in Western Australia. It was a pretty minor storm. There were some lightning strikes. That was a Sunday. I went to visit my mother. I rang her before I got there, and she didn't answer the phone. The phone rang out. I thought: 'That's pretty unusual. Mum's usually home on a Sunday.' She lives in Shoalwater Bay, so I just rocked up at her house. 'Mum, why didn't you answer the phone?' I asked her. She said, 'Well, the phone didn't ring.' I said: 'I rang it. It should have rung.' So we tested it with my mobile—she doesn't use her mobile. It rang on my phone, and rang out, but it was not ringing physically. She could not hear the phone ringing in the house. No-one could hear it. The phone was not working. By all accounts, the same thing happened for the whole street. It is an elderly community. They talk to their neighbours—most Australians do talk to their neighbours—and we quickly found out that, overnight, four or five houses on that street had all lost their landline. They'd all converted to the NBN maybe six months before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then the process started. We couldn't ring NBN on a Sunday—well, we could, but we couldn't get any help and we certainly couldn't make any appointments for a technician—so we started this on Monday, 23 April. On behalf of my mother, I rang the NBN, because she didn't have a phone. We had to charge up her rudimentary mobile that she hates to use, like many elderly in the community, but was forced to use. It's a good thing that she was forced to use it, because, if she hadn't made herself use it, she would have been without any form of telephone communication for over a week. We rang NBN on the Monday. We could not get a technician appointment to come and confirm what was happening until Friday, 27 April. My mother has a medic alert because she's quite elderly and has false knees—although they get her around quite well—so falls are a hazard for her. An elderly neighbour had a technician come a day earlier. The other neighbour also had a technician come a day earlier. Everyone was told, 'Your Telstra modems have been shorted out by the storm.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I rang NBN and said: 'All the neighbours' modems have been blown out by the storm. How about you get your technician to bring a modem over, just in case, so we can do it all at once and Mum can be back on the phone within a quick four days?' They said: 'No, that is certainly not the case. That is not going to happen. No-one will bring a modem to your mother until it's confirmed that the NBN is not at fault, and then we can dial up Telstra and get them to sort that out.' The technician comes on the Friday and says, unsurprisingly, 'Yes, it was the modem that's blown out; you need a new modem from Telstra.' So we rang them up and they said: 'That's true. We won't be able to get your mother a modem until 2 May.' Okay, that's how it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So then I ring and say: 'Can your technician come and install the modem, because I won't be around to help her. How is she going to have a landline and how's she going to get a medic alarm on?' They said, 'You'll have to call when the modem comes and wait another three to five business days for someone to come and connect your mum to a landline.' So, overall, it was going to be anywhere between 15 and 19 days that my mother would not have a phone. She lives on her own. She's an elderly woman in Shoalwater Bay. She has lived in this house, as has my family, since 1959—I kid you not. It is an old, copper-wired house. She has not been without a phone for more than a couple of hours in a big storm, and then, last month, she lost it for nearly 10 days. It is absurd and obscene that people can be put through this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rang the NBN every single day. It's not the fault of the operators on the end of the line. We know that. They're just doing their job. But it certainly is unfair on the elderly in that street. They'd all lost their phones for anywhere between four and 10 days. The only reason my mum got her phone connected more quickly is that as an MP—as all my colleagues in this House know—I have priority access to some of the providers and also have a bit of a platform on social media to complain, and that pushed the service forward. On Monday she did get reconnected, but, if I had not been able to use that privilege, she would not have been connected to a landline until today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing is that triple 0 calls in Western Australia were not working this week. How is it that Telstra can fail to have an adequate triple 0 service to St John Ambulance across Perth because a cable is hit by lightning in New South Wales?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on this government to do something, anything—something productive would be best—to fix the communications nightmare you have put the Australian people in, and, most upsetting for me personally, the nightmare you put my mother through last week, because of this rubbish NBN system you have presided over. You should hang your heads in shame.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was saying yesterday that further north in Lyons, in the township of Westbury, another of my constituents, Graeme, had been advised by NBN Co that he could commit to the NBN network. He signed up to receive the service. His business, home and fax lines were disconnected from the copper network so he could be connected to the NBN via fibre to the node, which had been run out through Westbury. It was only after he was disconnected from the copper network that Graeme was told he could not commit to the NBN because his home was too far from the node. As we know, copper can only go a certain distance with data transmission before it degrades. This is not a problem that would have occurred under Labor's fibre to the premises. If the government had stuck with Labor's fibre to the premises, there wouldn't have been this problem. So no-one told Graeme he could not get connected, until it was too late. His phone and fax lines were gone—phone and fax lines vital to his business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Graeme spent weeks trying to get some sort of service connected. Finally, in complete desperation, he contacted me to voice his concerns and frustration and to let me know his accountancy business was in danger of closing—in danger of closing!—after many years, all because essential services were being denied to him, through no fault of his own. Once again, Margaret, in my Perth office, who's just a wonder, was instrumental in getting Graeme's phone and fax and ADSL internet reconnected. Unfortunately, the months had taken their toll, and Graeme still lost a considerable amount of business that he's now trying to make up for. He was on the brink. So much for a government that likes to brag that it is pro business. And we have heard plenty of evidence today from the member for Bendigo and the member for Oxley about the impact of this government's substandard NBN on businesses in their electorates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The service is poor; the rollout is patchy. People are being disconnected from their old internet, even though they can't connect to the NBN. In some cases, people on the NBN are not even getting the same speeds that they used to get on ADSL and ADSL2. I know because I'm one of them. At home I'm on a fixed wireless tower. Now, that was fine when the tower went up six years ago. I live on an old sheep paddock. I don't expect to have a fibre connection to my place; I'm out in the sticks. I've got no problem being on the tower. When it was built six years ago, I had good service. But now, at peak time, it's hopeless—a two- or three-megabits-per-second service at peak time. And why? It's because developers have built new housing estates nearby, and, instead of providing the infrastructure to connect those homes to fibre to the node, they've left those homeowners to be connected to the tower. So there are hundreds more people accessing the signal than there should be, which is crunching down the speed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must mention here that, under Labor, Midway Point, which is near me, was one of the first places to get fibre to the premises. These new estates in Midway Point were meant to get fibre to the node, but, because of some loophole that allows developers to not necessarily provide the infrastructure that is required, these homes are ending up on fixed wireless instead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of regional Australia know they are being left behind by the widening digital divide between city and country. Before I get to that, I just want to say that I've dealt with Telstra and NBN Co over my particular situation, but I never tell them I'm an MP. I think it's important that I get the same service as everybody else in the community. The way you have to deal with these companies drives you mad, including the long waiting times that Australians have to put up with to get simple resolutions. I've had four modems offered to be sent to me, even though I know it's not a modem issue. I had to move heaven and earth to get a technician to come to my premises and confirm: 'No, it's nothing to do with your technology. It actually is an overloaded tower.' Now we have to deal with NBN Co to see whether they will upgrade it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is part of the digital divide that people in the country face every day compared to those in the city, and that's a digital divide that Labor sought to narrow, not widen. It was no mistake that some of the first places to receive fibre to the premises under the original NBN were in regional Australia, including my electorate, because Labor believes that every Australian deserves quality internet, not just those who live in Wentworth and other wealthy, leafy, inner-city suburbs.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  The government's telecommunications reform package is good for consumers, good for industry and good for regional Australia. The passage of these historic reforms will mean a more efficient and competitive telecommunications sector. The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2017 and the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2017 implement a coherent three-part package to improve the regulatory framework for the supply of high-speed broadband by amending separation rules and creating new supply and funding arrangements. These bills will improve the provision of high-speed broadband in Australia by making carrier separation rules for high-speed residential networks more effective but also more flexible and giving carriers greater scope to invest in superfast networks and compete. They will improve it by introducing new statutory infrastructure provider obligations on NBN Co and others to support the ongoing delivery of high-speed broadband services. They will also improve it by establishing the Regional Broadband Scheme to provide equitable long-term funding for NBN Co's satellite and fixed wireless services for regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Telecommunications carriers and consumers will benefit from the changes of separation rules. They will improve competition and investment in the telecommunications market. Consumers will also benefit from the statutory infrastructure provider measures, which will ensure everyone in Australia will be able to access high-speed broadband services upon reasonable request. The rules set out baseline standards for these services: peak downloads of at least 25 megabits per second and peak upload speeds of at least five megabits per second. These services also need to support voice communication on fixed line or fixed wireless networks. Additionally, the minister will be able to make service provider rules, dealing with consumer issues like the handballing of disputes between wholesale and retail providers. Consumers will have clear information on why any reasonable request for connection has been refused and by whom, enabling them to pursue redress with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman or the regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumers in regional Australia will benefit from the Regional Broadband Scheme, which establishes an equitable, long-term funding arrangement for NBN Co's fixed and satellite networks. We promised to speed up the rollout and deliver broadband upgrades as soon as possible, and that's exactly what we've done, to deliver fast broadband sooner, at less cost to taxpayers and more affordably for consumers. NBN Co is using the technology best matched to each area of Australia. The government requires NBN Co to ensure upgrade paths are available under its statement of expectations. NBN Co also plans to launch new products and additional features over time in a series of product releases to improve the range of products with which broadband retailers can serve consumers and businesses. By 2020, 90 per cent of premises in the fixed line footprint will be able to access download speeds of 50 megabits per second.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's instructive to remember Labor's record. Labor promised the world and yet delivered service to just 51,000 premises by September 2013 after six years in government and after spending $6 billion. It was a sorry tale of incompetence and abjectly poor performance. By contrast, under the coalition, the National Broadband Network is over half complete and is extending its reach to towns large and small right across Australia. In September 2013, fewer than three per cent of Australian premises could obtain a service on the network. Today, over half of Australian premises—over 7.6 million homes and businesses—are in ready-for-service areas, and there are more than 3.8 million active users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition's stated approach of supporting fibre to the premises would have made NBN Co completely uncompetitive. Everyday Australians would have paid more for their internet, and the price of internet bills would have risen by over $500 a year. Reverting to an all-fibre-to-the-premises approach would have seen the NBN completed nationwide six to eight years later than it is being delivered under the Turnbull government and at a cost of an extra $30 billion. The delayed rollout would also have reduced NBN's revenue and made it less competitive. By reducing costs, accelerating the rollout and earning revenue sooner, the government has put the NBN business model on a more sustainable basis and made it more competitive. Under the Turnbull government, NBN's annual revenue has grown from a paltry $17 million in the 2013 financial year to close to $2 billion for the 2018 financial year, and we are on track to have eight million paying customers in 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package includes a range of measures to improve competition because we know that wholesale market competition will result in better outcomes for consumers and the economy. The Regional Broadband Scheme places NBN Co on an even footing with its competitors by ensuring all carriers, not just NBN Co, play a role in contributing to the cost of delivering broadband in regional and remote Australia. This scheme will require all fixed-line carriers to contribute $7.10 per month for each premises on their network that has an active high-speed fixed-line broadband service. NBN Co will continue to pay around 95 per cent of the total cost, compared to the 100 per cent it pays today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to emphasise that the Regional Broadband Scheme will not result in price rises for the eight million—the 95 per cent of consumers—expected to be connected to NBN by 2020. Consumers using the NBN are already paying for the costs of the fixed wireless and satellite networks, which are built into NBN Co's existing pricing model. In fact, under the Regional Broadband Scheme, high-margin networks supplying to big business and enterprise customers will, for the first time, in many cases, contribute to the cost of regional broadband. It is only fair that these NBN-comparable carriers contribute to Australia's investment in serving the one million Australians who are able to access the fixed wireless and satellite networks and the over 320,000 Australians who are already connected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has included provisions in the Regional Broadband Scheme to help small infrastructure providers, like those servicing greenfields areas, to transition to contributing to the cost of regional broadband. These transition measures include an exemption for the first 25,000 residential and small business premises on their networks for the first five years. They also include implementing a cap so that the monthly charge amount cannot be raised above $10, indexed annually to the consumer price index. They also include a statutory requirement for a policy review within the first four years of the Regional Broadband Scheme to assess its scope as technology and market conditions change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to comment briefly on the sanctimonious, Uriah Heep-style handwringing amendment from the Labor Party. The suggestion in this amendment that this issue is all due to the coalition is entirely and absolutely wrong and also, frankly, historically ignorant. It was squarely part of the policy approach of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government that the National Broadband Network would be a national network and that profits in metropolitan areas would cross-subsidise loss-making services in regional areas. Of course, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government failed to deliver the policy framework to achieve that outcome in the face of competing networks being rolled out in metropolitan areas. This bill is yet another example of the Turnbull government having to fix up the chaotic mess we inherited in this policy area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a suggestion in the motion put forward by the shadow minister that the Regional Broadband Scheme imposes a charge per line on fixed line carriers as a consequence of the multi-technology mix introduced by the coalition. That is squarely and factually wrong—wrong, wrong, wrong. It is a design feature of the National Broadband Network as introduced by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government that there would be a cross-subsidy from metropolitan services to regional and remote services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, a key fact about which Labor is completely silent is that the multi-technology mix will reduce capital costs of the NBN by about $30 billion, in turn reducing the amount of that necessary cross-subsidy. But it is hardly surprising that our innumerate and managerially incompetent political opponents would fail to understand this basic point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, these bills create more opportunities for competition at the network and retail levels, while providing consumers across Australia with confidence that they will have access to the high-speed broadband services they need to participate in today's digital society. These bills have been the subject of extensive consultation. They are strongly supported by consumer groups and regional stakeholders, including the Regional, Rural and Remote Communications Coalition and the National Farmers' Federation. I commend these bills to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Proposed amendments (1) to (12) on sheet LC109 delay the timing of the initial report by carriers to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and introduce deemed disallowance provisions for certain ministerial determinations. As currently drafted, carriers must give a report on the number of premises on their network that had a fixed line broadband service during November 2017 to the ACCC before 31 December 2017. Those dates, of course, have passed. Therefore, the government proposes, with these amendments, to update these reporting dates and to provide more time for carriers to prepare for the report. These amendments require carriers to report to the ACCC by the end of the third month after the bill commences for the period of the second month after the bill commences. The amendments also enable the Minister for Communications to further delay the required reporting period by legislative instrument. However, the latest month the minister may specify is October 2018, with the report to be provided by the end of November 2018.</span>

By this amendment, the relevant instrument would be deemed to have been disallowed if a notice or motion to disallow it had not been withdrawn or remained unresolved in either house of parliament by the end of the usual disallowance period. This amendment aligns the Regional Broadband Scheme more closely with the usual disallowance procedures in the Legislation Act and implements the recommendations of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I commend the amendments to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment makes a minor adjustment to the bill, to enhance parliamentary scrutiny of the Regional Broadband Scheme. The government proposes, by amendment (1) on sheet HV220, to modify the proposed disallowance provision applying to ministerial determinations that relate to changing the charge amount. By this amendment, the relevant instrument would be deemed to have been disallowed if a notice of motion to disallow it had not been withdrawn or remained unresolved in either house of parliament by the end of the usual disallowance period. This amendment aligns the Regional Broadband Scheme more closely with the usual disallowance provisions in the Legislation Act 2003 and implements the recommendation of the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I commend the amendment to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  I rise to recognise the National Compact on Permanent Migration that was recently signed by a wide range of Australian trade unions, businesses and civil society groups. The diverse signatories to this compact recognise:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… that Australia's permanent migration program is essential to Australian society and our economy and do not support any reduction to the scheme. … Our permanent migration program has been central to Australia's economic and social development and will be critical to Australia's future as a productive and globally integrated economy and society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It then offers 10 sensible principles for maintaining Australia's immigration program. I agree with the signatories. Australia is an immigrant nation. Indeed, if you are not an Indigenous Australian, there is nothing more Australian than being a migrant. We have seen in this week's budget that we live in an era of ideological cleavage. I am proud of the stand Labor is taking on fighting inequality and standing up for inclusion in this ideological debate. But it is important too that there are some areas that are so fundamental to our national identity and our national interests that all sides of politics are able to unite and speak with one voice.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to the Migration Council, the ACTU, United Voice, the Australian Industry Group, ACOSS, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia and the Settlement Council of Australia. Well done on taking a stand. This compact is even more important in light of media reports today that Senator Hanson is demanding cuts to our immigration program in exchange for her support for the Turnbull government's budget. It is important that mainstream Australia unites to reject the extremists that seek to attack the foundation of Australian identity and seek to use immigration to divide us. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

One life was lost and more than 200 homes destroyed when the Logan and Albert Rivers flooded as a result of the rains brought on by ex-Tropical Cyclone Debbie. With the Logan River and the Albert River peaking at near-record levels, it became one of Logan's worst natural disasters since 1974. One year on, I'm very pleased to share with the House the resilience and commitment of residents, businesses and local charities. They have shone over the past 12 months through that devastation and brought out the best in the local community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of weeks ago, I attended two fantastic community events to mark one year since the flood and celebrate the light at the end of what, for many, has been a very dark tunnel. I'd like to congratulate the Loganlea Community Centre—in particular, Cassie and the team—for putting on a fantastic family fun day with over 3,500 people attending. The Beenleigh Neighbourhood Centre, in partnership with the Logan House Fire Support Network, hosted a family day, which was a terrific event. Well done to Louie, Christine and the team. Both events paid tribute to the outstanding work of our local emergency services and emergency volunteers during the flood. I have no doubt our community will continue to rebuild stronger and more resilient than ever.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  This time next week, Muslim communities in Australia and around the world will begin a month-long fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic lunar calendar, is prescribed as a month of fasting in the Koran and commences at the sighting of the crescent moon. It is a time of deep spiritual reflection for Muslims. Prayers, charity and recitation of the Koran become a central part of worship during the month. It enhances faith and strengthens the bonds of family relationships. At the sounding of the adhan, the call to prayer, Muslims break their fast with three dates before eating with family, friends and community. The ritual of a day-long fast is ended with extended prayers at the mosque.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the streets come alive, particularly in Lakemba after dusk, when the evening prayers are completed. Families and communities gather in Haldon Street in Lakemba. People come from all around Sydney late at night and any time of night to see packed streets where people are observing fasting, acts of charity and prayer. I would encourage my fellow colleagues here in the House of Representatives to accept the invitation one night during the month of Ramadan to drop into Lakemba. A member from the other place dropped into Lakemba only a few weeks ago for all the wrong reasons. I'd like those opposite and my own colleagues to take the opportunity to turn up and receive the generosity of spirit which the community brings to all.</span>

Over 66,000 people in my electorate on low and medium incomes will benefit straightaway. Ninety-four per cent of Australians should not pay more than a third of what they earn in tax. To the people who currently live in Petrie, if you earn $18,200 a year, you currently pay zero tax—that is, no tax. If you earn $37,000 a year, you'll pay $3,572. If you earn a wage of $52,000, you'll pay about $8,400 in tax. If you earn $87,000 a year, you'll pay $19,822 in tax. If your earnings are much higher, at $180,000 you will currently be paying $54,232 in tax and if you earn $200,000 you'll currently be paying $63,232. I believe in lower taxes and reward for effort and so does the Prime Minister, and because of the $40 billion in additional revenue, because of our crackdown on multinationals and because of job creation and economic growth, we can now give your money back to you. It's your money, not ours. We support lower taxes for 94 per cent of Australians.</span>

There was no money for Mitiamo, for which $14.5 million was being asked; no money for the Sunraysia Modernisation Project, for which a mere $3 million was being asked; no money for the Werribee and Bacchus Marsh Irrigation District, for which $14.5 million was being asked; and no money for the Coldstream Recycled-Water Pipeline or the Yarra project, for which under $8 million was being asked. In addition, the Commonwealth was aware of the state's request for funding for the East Grampians project, looking for $32 million. Again, Victoria has been dudded by this government. It is an outrage, because they are not just dudding the state; they are dudding our stakeholders. Those stakeholders would be in the agriculture sector. They'd be working really hard on their farms to get produce to market, and they're being sold down the river by this government. It is really important in my electorate, where the Werribee Irrigation District is heading into the second stage, funded by the stakeholders and the state government. This government is going to hold back the last two stages of a modernisation project 40 years in the making. They should be ashamed of themselves.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Fisher businessman Mark Forbes has a bold vision: to create, build and operate Australia's first specialist residential facility for the treatment of eating disorders, right in my electorate of Fisher. Mark's passion has led him not only to dream up the concept but to find a block of land and commit to buying it. But passion can only get you so far. With settlement fast approaching, Mark still needed funds to complete the sale and get EndED House past this critical hurdle. On Monday, the project hung in the balance, but, as they have so often done before in the service of our community, local philanthropists Roy and Nola Thompson stepped up and gave Mark a $1 million cheque for EndED House. As with their $10 million donation to the Thompson Institute, Roy and Nola have used the legacy of their business success to help the vulnerable and to make the coast a leader in another nationally important field—that is, mental health research.</span>

Jordan is a Penrith Anglican College student and an environmental warrior. Many of the words I say today are actually his words. He was raised on his mother's phrase, 'Think globally, act locally.' He has raised with me the issue of phosphates and notes that the Murray-Darling Basin and the Great Barrier Reef are being relentlessly damaged. These waterways face fertilisers, pesticides and dish-washing detergents coming into them, all sharing a common toxic factor: phosphates.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jordan, like me, is lucky enough to live in the World Heritage Blue Mountains National Park. He is only a five-minute walk to the precious Glenbrook Creek, which, unknown to many, houses one of the three remaining self-sustaining Macquarie perch colonies in New South Wales. This fish is currently listed by the law of the Commonwealth as highly endangered and it is a victim of these toxic phosphates. Jordan wants to see change to protect these fish and to protect our fragile ecosystem. He wants to see new legislation to ban phosphates within dish-washing tablets and detergents, as the United States and Europe already have. Jordan is calling on this parliament to act, and I'll be doing what I can to help him see his vision become a reality.</span>

This program provides vital pastoral care services to thousands of students and school communities across Australia. Nineteen schools in my electorate of Robertson, including Woy Woy South Public School, Gosford Public School and Henry Kendall High School are set to benefit.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On budget night, the government announced an extension of the National School Chaplaincy Program on a permanent basis, and we're backing this program with an extra $247 million. Chaplains can now continue their integral role of supporting the health and wellbeing of our students, and school chaplains will now undertake antibullying training provided by the eSafety Commissioner to better support our students. This additional training will better support school chaplains in managing student welfare issues, ensuring they are fully equipped to deal with the challenges in the school community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen firsthand the positive impact that the National School Chaplaincy Program has had in Robertson and the strong community support that there is behind it. Already I've heard from dozens of local residents who have told me what this announcement means to them. Bill and Judy Wells from Point Clare told me they were excited to know there'll be more ongoing positive input into the lives of our next generation. Bill Dagger from Killcare wrote to me thanking this government for the wise insight to leave some light in our schools. I commend the government on its commitment to this vital program.</span>

Indeed, the housing situation is now so bad for so many people, especially in Tasmania and in my electorate of Denison, that it's realistic to call it a crisis—a crisis that is in large part the result of a failure of public policy by a series of federal and state governments over many years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only ways to turn this around are (1) more crisis accommodation; (2) more Housing Tasmania properties and other social housing; (3) more supported accommodation for people with specific needs; (4) reining in Airbnb and returning it to the original intent of making spare rooms available; (5) tax changes, including reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax; (6) rent-to-buy public housing; (7) a 30 per cent increase in Commonwealth rent assistance; (8) improved grants and access to low-interest loans for first home buyers; (9) the abolition of Tasmania's public housing debt, which would release $15 million a year for more houses; and (10) light rail to the northern suburbs of Hobart to better link affordable housing with the city and jobs. These are the sorts of things that are needed—not more bandaids and not more talk but real reforms now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I want to update the House on what the government's budget means for the hardworking Australians in my electorate of O'Connor. The 61,173 people in O'Connor will see tax relief in the next 12 months. That's an enormous number, and it's made up of low- and middle-income earners: nurses, teachers, tradesmen and the workers who serve our community. For a family with two working adults on average income, that's an additional $1,060 per annum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate covers a third of the state of Western Australia, and we've got a huge road network. That network needs to be maintained and upgraded, and that's why this government has created a $3.5 billion fund to upgrade roads of strategic importance.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in O'Connor, it's not always easy for students to access university. Our students often need to move to the city, and that's why we're going to improve independent youth allowance to support them. We're investing $50 million to increase the income threshold for families, currently $160,000, by a further $10,000 for every additional child. In simple terms, more regional kids will receive financial support from this government when they enrol in university.</span>

My electorate has already received $14.5 million through this program, and I'll be fighting to see that we continue to support these groundbreaking projects in O'Connor.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  This weekend we'll be observing the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Battle of Coral and Balmoral during the Vietnam War. On 12 May 1968 the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment, together with the 102nd Field Artillery Battery and other attachments, were deployed to Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral some 20 kilometres north of Bien Hoa city in southern Vietnam. They were deployed there to prevent North Vietnamese attacks on the cities of Bien Hoa and Saigon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 2.40 am on 13 May the battle began with massive enemy assaults. It was a fierce close-quarter battle that lasted over two hours. As the sun rose in Australia on Mother's Day 1968, 11 Australian sons lay dead and 28 were wounded. As Coral and Balmoral veteran Ray Darragh said, so many mothers on both sides lost their sons that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These battles were fought through until 6 June, claiming the lives of 26 Anzacs and an estimated 300 North Vietnamese combatants. Recently the veterans of Coral and Balmoral learned that they were all to be honoured with a unit citation for bravery, 50 years after the battle began. This award highlights the fact that we can always do more to honour and take care of our veterans and current serving personnel.</span>

Some know him for stalling marriage equality for political pointscoring. Others know him as the robotic, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blade Runner</span>-esque replicant agreeing with what has been said, without even hearing it. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gospel of Shorten is 'thou shalt put Bill first'. He was elected to serve the people of Maribyrnong. He's now seeking to shaft them for an electorate he can better take for granted. He gave a rolled-gold guarantee that Labor MPs wouldn't resign as dual citizens; they're now signing their resignations. In government he supported tax cuts; in opposition he switched. In rural Queensland he spruiked new mining projects; in inner Melbourne he was slippery in opposing them. He seemingly advocated for worker's rights as a union official; he then sold out their wages to boost union coffers. The trade union royal commission clocked up 14 different findings against the AWU for corruption, false accounting and breaches of law, and mostly while Bill Shorten was their shady leader. Workers never got justice, while he simply slipped and slithered his way into parliament. There is a reason they call him 'Shifty, Shady Shorten'.</span>

Myopia, or short-sightedness, affects over a third of Australians. A recent study of teenagers found a doubling in cases of myopia over the last decade. It's an alarming increase, and I urge parents to as early as possible have their children's eyes checked by an optometrist. It's critical for younger children and their development. Approximately 80 per cent of what a child learns is through their visual system, so correct eye health is very important.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I was pleased to launch at the Brien Holden Vision Institute at the University of New South Wales a new children's book called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Flying Optometrist</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> It's a book by Pagewood local Joanne Anderton. It's an early introduction for kids aged four-plus to the importance of eye health. It tells of the real-world adventures and dedicated community service of her dad, Dr Phil Anderton, who has a rare combination of skills: optometry and aviation. He used to travel around rural and regional New South Wales in his little red plane he built himself, checking out the eyes of local kids in communities and improving eye health in those communities. His work helped prevent myopia, making sure more young Australians have healthy eyes now and a clear vision for their future. I thank the Brien Holden Vision Institute at the University of New South Wales for their many years of dedicated service towards eye health.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A voyage to the Middle East usually takes an average of 21 days. That is 540 consecutive hours where sheep travel in very hot, cramped conditions. Under Australian law, if a dog was left in a car on a hot summer day, that would be regarded as animal cruelty; yet we have 65,000 sheep at a time being transported in these awful conditions. I met with Dr Portia Reading. She is a veterinary surgeon resident in La Trobe. She joins the call for a ban on live sheep exports and explained to me that, regardless of the stocking density, when it comes to the live export of sheep to the Middle East, with high temperatures, no ventilation and high humidity, the sheep will always suffer. I'm calling for a ban on live sheep exports. This is not a knee-jerk reaction. This is something I have called for for a long time. I've been given assurances from the industry before that animals wouldn't suffer. I've obviously been conned. We must compensate our farmers, protect our hardworking Australian farmers and help them with a transition package. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

They have come because on Tuesday they listened in horror as the government handed down a budget which put the interests of big business ahead of the needs of battlers. They watched with jaw-dropping horror as the government confirmed their commitment to deliver an $80 billion tax cut to the big end of town while leaving over 90,000 elderly Australians without the home-care packages that they need. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a rail crisis in the Illawarra. The New South Wales government concedes that the rail link between Sydney and the Illawarra will be at full capacity by 2021. That's just three years away. But not only does the New South Wales government, like the federal government, not have a plan; they are part of the problem. They are part of the problem because they've done nothing for over six years. In fact, they've made services worse. But they are also the government parties which cancelled the Maldon to Dombarton rail link, which means we don't have the capacity to get freight rail off the passenger rail system. We need a better deal for the Illawarra than the deal this government is giving us. </span>

One and a half million Armenian men, women and children lost their lives, but the Armenian people are strong and proud. They survived and are now thriving around the world, including in Australia, especially in my electorate of Bennelong. I recently paid my respects to the memory of the victims at a memorial service put on by the City of Ryde in Memorial Park at Meadowbank in Bennelong. I'm proud to represent Bennelong's Armenian-Australian community. They have a magnificent community centre in Santa Rosa Park, Ryde, where they gather to support one another and contribute positively to our society. The Armenian National Committee also does great work. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Today I'd like to bring to the attention of the House the importance of 15 May, a significant day to many Palestinians. In April 2017 I travelled to Israel and Palestine to commemorate the charge at Beersheba. A vivid and poignant memory of my visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, burned into my memory, is the sight of the Nakba key. The key is a symbol of dispossession, loss and hope for return, a symbol of perseverance. It represents pride. It is everywhere in the Palestinian territories. The Nakba key is a large ornate key such as you would see with an ancient door or gate. You see this key hanging in markets and on the front doors of houses. This key is there. Once the context is explained, you realise the extent of the loss faced by the Palestinian people in what they describe as the catastrophe. It represents the houses to which they one day wish to return. The key represents and underscores the loss, the ferocity and the suddenness of the dispossession faced by the Palestinian people in 1948 on the establishment of the State of Israel. As a mark of the plight of the Palestinians, it is enduring and it is powerful. We must, as longstanding friends of Israel, continue to urge for the peaceful resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Again, it's not about condemnation of the State of Israel; it's about calling for the two-state resolution of the conflict to be delivered.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  This week's budget contains much good news for many of my constituents in Menzies. Up to 60,000 taxpayers in Menzies will benefit from the low- and middle-income tax relief in this upcoming 2018-19 financial year. Some 4,000 families will benefit from the new childcare system in operation from 2 July. Victorian public hospitals will receive a 30 per cent increase in funding. The 14,000 new aged-care places will assist many older people, including people in my electorate of Menzies and my neighbouring electorates of Chisholm and Deakin as well, to stay in their own homes. An estimated 1,600 people with disabilities and their families in Menzies will benefit from the guaranteed funding for the NDIS. And, of course, a preschool funding boost will ensure that almost 2,000 children in Menzies can access 15 hours of quality early learning in the year before school. But, in addition to that, my constituents and those in surrounding areas who are suffering from congestion on the roads, particularly in the north-east parts of Melbourne, will benefit from the ultimate building of two major pieces of infrastructure—the East West Link, which the money remains there to build, and the North East Link to ease those choke points across the Yarra River between my electorate and suburbs to the north.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  There was plenty of bad news in this week's budget for Canberra, yet again. There were cuts to Public Service jobs in the thousands, yet again. There were cuts to our national institutions, yet again—more jobs gone from the National Archives and the National Library. And there is next to zero infrastructure investment—a mere 0.2 per cent investment in Canberra in infrastructure, after the paltry 0.004 per cent investment last year. It's an insult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But one bit of bad news that completely blindsided me was the government's continued push to decentralise government agencies based on no cost-benefit analysis. You'd think that this government would have learnt from the disaster and the debacle of the shameless, blatant pork barrel that is the APVMA relocation from Canberra to Armidale—a pork barrel that has seen the loss of hundreds of years of expertise and skill, and agricultural approvals plummet and fall through the floor, and that is opposed by industry associations. So I say to the government: release the cost-benefit analysis that shows that this latest decentralisation thought bubble is not like the APVMA pork barrel—all cost and no benefit.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  The Anzac spirit exemplified by our service men and women on the beaches at Gallipoli, on Flanders fields, in the Pacific, in Vietnam and in other conflicts continues to shine with the very special people at Box Hill RSL in Chisholm. I recently had the great honour to join former Deputy Prime Minister and Vietnam veteran the Hon. Tim Fischer and the Vietnam Veterans' Association at the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of Coral-Balmoral. Many of the committee at the Box Hill RSL are Vietnam veterans, and it was fantastic to celebrate the promotion of five members to life membership. They were John Haward, president of the sub-branch for 14 years; Brian Tateson, vice-president of the sub-branch; Rod Burgess, secretary of the sub-branch for 10 years; Jerry Walbridge, committee member of the sub-branch for 14 years, and Vic Gallen, who is also a dedicated member of the sub-branch. My sincere congratulations to these five outstanding men, who have dedicated so much of their lives to service and memory.</span>

Given that the Prime Minister has now had 24 hours to confirm the facts, I repeat: what is the total cost of corporate tax cuts over 10 years from 1 July 2018, both legislated and proposed to be legislated?</span>

This is the deliverer of rolled-gold guarantees. He is a guaranteed deliverer of Olympic proportions. He gave a rolled-gold guarantee that all of his members, including the ones that have just resigned, were eligible to sit in the House. And he did so after the High Court had made it abundantly clear last year that they were not eligible. Oh, yes, he did. He kept on saying they were fine—and of course he was backed up by that booming advocate, the member for Isaacs—a reminder of the late Neville Wran when he said, 'Anyone can go to jail if they get the right lawyer.'</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, on direct relevance: the question was very specific. If the Prime Minister wants to talk about what the High Court will so hold, he can do so in answer to a Dixer.</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, you're absolutely right: I'm coming straight to the substance of the question, and the substance of the question is tax. The substance of the question is the $200 billion—more than $200 billion—of tax the Leader of the Opposition is proposing to impose on the Australian economy. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is, when it comes to company tax, the Leader of the Opposition himself stood right here, during the Labor government, and said reducing company tax increases investment, improves productivity, increases employment and results in better wages. He said all of that, and he said it again and again and again. And you know what? He was right. The reality is, however, that you cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition, whether he's giving a rolled-gold guarantee or just a sort of a silver-plated guarantee. None of his undertakings can be trusted, whether they are to the workers at Cleanevent, to Kevin Rudd or Julia Gillard.</span>

The Prime Minister is speaking about company tax or corporate tax, and he's comparing and contrasting. And if I feel at any point that the Prime Minister—or any other minister, for that matter—is ignoring my rulings I'm more than capable of taking action. The Prime Minister knows that the question was about company tax. He's been talking about company tax, and comparing and contrasting, and I'm listening very closely to his answer.</span>

As we've said before, the medium-term cost of the unlegislated component of the Enterprise Tax Plan, which is currently before the Senate, is $35.6 billion over the period from 2016-17 to 2027-28. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to do some figuring and analysis of what it would cost the Australian economy to repeal the tax relief already granted to small and medium businesses—family-owned businesses—he can do that himself. He's got to front up and tell Australian businesses and their employees the price they would pay in lost investment and lost jobs from a Shorten government.</span>

The government is committed to ensuring that the Australian economy is strong, because we know that everything depends on a strong economy. It means we can guarantee the essential services Australians rely on. It means we can properly fund our hospitals and our schools with record funding. It means we can guarantee Medicare in legislation and make medicines like Kisqali, a breakthrough breast cancer treatment, more affordable. And I'm pleased to say, on the subject of new medicines, that the government is listing a new medicine a day on the PBS, slashing the price of medicines by thousands of dollars, and that's making a huge difference to Australians in need, and we are able to support them in that way because we have a strong economy. It means we can deliver an ageing package that gives older Australians real choice to stay in their home for longer or go into the workforce. It means we can fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme, cut the cost of child care for mums and dads and properly fund the AFP and the other security agencies so they can keep Australians safe. And it means we can afford to build the congestion-busting infrastructure, the road and the rail, that will ensure that Australians get home to their families safer and sooner.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of that is possible without a strong economy. It enables all of this and more. A strong economy means that businesses are investing and creating jobs. On that front, we know that last year Australians created more jobs than in any calendar year in our history: 415,000. A thousand jobs a day are being added. That shows what a strong economy delivers. A strong economy means more jobs and it enables us to have lower taxes for Australians. It means that, as the economy continues to strengthen, Australians will benefit from tax relief that prioritises middle- and lower-income earners. From next year a worker on an average income will be $530 a year better off. That's a quarterly electricity bill, the kids' school books, or five or six trips to the petrol station. What that does is give real support to families on middle and lower incomes—real relief, real support for Australian workers. It is their money. They've earned it, and they deserve to keep more of it. Labor will put all of this at risk because, at the end of the day, the Labor Party does not believe that those hard-earned dollars belong to the people that earn them; they believe the government is entitled to them. We don't. They're Australians; they're entitled to keep more of it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We don't have a policy to increase tax on small and medium-sized businesses up to $50 million. I don't have such a policy. The Prime Minister doesn't have a policy. The only people who have a policy to increase taxes on small and medium businesses is the Labor Party. If that's their policy, they should tell Australians what it costs, because we don't have such a policy. It is their policy to increase taxes on small and medium-sized businesses. The shadow Treasurer should be talking to the 3.3 million businesses out there that have a turnover of less than $50 million, and he should ask the 7.2 million Australians who work for those businesses why he should put up the taxes on those businesses. That's your policy. You cost it. Do your own work. We're getting on with the job of putting more than a thousand people in work every single day under the policies of this government. It's up to them to do their own work.</span>

I thank the Australian people, who know that 10 million of them will be getting tax relief under this budget. The small businesses will be getting tax relief, not just from the budget passed but from the extension of the instant asset write-off for small businesses for a further year. Our budget invests in a stronger economy. We have a tax plan for a stronger economy. The Labor Party has a tax plan for a weaker economy. Only a tax plan that creates jobs and rewards investment, effort and people who put in the hard yards produces a stronger economy. We are investing in key infrastructure. We are investing in science and technology to boost business performance—including farmers' access to additional markets through our export trade deals. We are investing in new industries. We are investing in a stronger economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is being done at the same time as keeping our spending under control. Real growth in expenditure has been 1.6 per cent over the entire term of this coalition government. Real spending growth is less than two per cent, which is at the lowest level of any government in more than 50 years. On top of that, we are getting spending under control by bringing it down as a share of the economy to less than the long-run average, to 24.7 per cent. We are keeping taxes under control with a clear tax speed limit, because on this side of the House, in the Liberal and National parties, we know that too much tax is too much tax. On the Labor Party side, too much tax is never enough. It's never enough for the Labor Party, because they cannot control themselves when it comes to spending. That's why this budget that we have handed down has turned the corner on debt.</span>

                  </a>  If Australia's company tax rate stays at 30 per cent for most companies—for the larger companies with over $50 million in turnover—by 2020 there will only be one country in the OECD with a higher tax rate, and that is Portugal. It is a competitive world, but I have to say that, when Australian companies are looking for capital, they don't normally see themselves as only competing with Portugal; they want to compete with the whole world. We are in a position where France is going down to 25 per cent. The US—obviously the largest economy—has gone to 21 per cent. The UK is below 20 per cent.</span>

This leader changed all of the commitments over many years that we saw from the Labor Party which recognised that Australia had to be competitive internationally. He has abandoned that, and when you abandon international competitiveness—whether you abandon it on tax or whether you abandon it on free trade—you are abandoning Australian workers and their jobs.</span>

We can look after everyone in our community because of our progressive tax system where people who earn more pay a higher rate of tax. But your new flat tax plan is the end of progressive taxation in this country. How is it fair that someone earning $200,000 a year pays the same rate of tax as someone who is earning just above the minimum wage? Why do you want to be the Prime Minister that killed egalitarianism?</span>

So the marginal tax rate which he's objecting to—he doesn't like it—from $41,000 up to $200,000 will be 32½c. This is the outcome. At that time, someone on $205,000 taxable income, earning five times as much as someone on $41,000 taxable income, will pay 13 times as much tax. That is the whole point. The tax systems remains thoroughly progressive, in the sense that the bulk of the tax is paid by people on higher incomes. The bulk of the tax, as is the case now, will be paid by the few and not by the many. But what it will ensure is that constituents in his electorate and in every electorate in this House who want to earn more, who want to get ahead, who want to do some more hours, who want to take on another promotion or start a business will know that they will not be put off that or disincentivised by a higher and higher marginal tax rate. It is an outstanding reform and it speaks to the optimism, the confidence and the aspiration that underpins the strength of the Australian economy. We know what makes the Australian economy strong. It's the optimism, the investment, the confidence of Australians—of Australian businesses in particular—and we are backing them.</span>

We've handed down a budget which sees net debt fall by $30 billion over the next four years. We have turned the corner on debt. It has taken us five years to wind back the reckless spending of the Labor Party and turn the debt ship around and to ensure that from this point we are reducing net debt in this country by $30 billion over the next four years and more than $230 billion over the next 10 years, and we do that simply by living within our means. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government lives within its means, just like all Australians live within their means. Australians know that the Labor Party have no idea how to live within their means, because every time they get in they just wreck the joint. They just wreck the joint because they cannot live within their means. That's why they always put up taxes. They just keep jacking up the taxes because they don't know how to control expenditure. This is a government that is living within its means—1.6 per cent real growth in expenditure over the next four years, less than two per cent since the time we came to government. Under the Labor Party, real growth and expenditure averaged four per cent—more than double what we are now doing as a government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you live within your means, when you provide for a stronger economy, it means you can do the things that guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. And it's not the rolled-gold guarantee of the Leader of the Opposition. That's fool's gold if you're going to rely on the fake rolled-gold guarantees of the Leader of the Opposition. Our guarantees are based on knowing that you need to create a strong economy to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on: the National Disability Insurance Scheme; $1.4 billion for affordable new medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; record health funding of $34.4 billion and our new hospitals agreement—$30 billion in additional funding for hospitals—which state and territory governments all around the country are signing up to over the next five years; and $24.5 billion in additional funding for our schools, which is 50 per cent more per student on average. By guaranteeing our focus on building a stronger economy, that is what pays for everything.</span>

Well, the Australian people won't be fooled by this rolled-gold failure and this rolled-gold fate. What we see in the Leader of the Opposition is a shifty character. He's shifty as.</span>

The best way to explain the recent High Court decision is to simply read directly what they said. At paragraph 21: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The principal submission of the Commonwealth Attorney-General is that it is not enough for a candidate merely to have taken steps to renounce …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The Attorney-General's primary submission is clearly correct. It reflects the law as stated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Sykes v Cleary</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Re Canavan</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The court was at pains to set out that this was not a new test and that it reflected the test previously set out in the 1992 precedent. Ten times in the judgement the court explained how the Gallagher decision applied the same test as was set out only last year in the Canavan decision. So whose description should we accept as correct—that of the seven judges of the High Court or that of the Leader of the Opposition? Sadly, the opposition leader's track record of being straight and correct on the citizenship issue is not very impressive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November last year he was asked on the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Today </span>show: 'Can you guarantee that no Labor members will be caught up in this?' He said: 'Yes. Yes, a rolled-gold guarantee.' 'Yes,' he said. How did he get it so wrong, Members? Was it shiftiness? Was it a propensity to say whatever he needs to to get out of trouble at the time? Was it a willingness to deliberately mischaracterise the law in a cynical delaying tactic? No, Members, it was the lawyers' fault! That's how it all went wrong! 'That's what our lawyers were saying to us. We followed the legal advice.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we all want to know, Leader of the Opposition, is: who were this team of crack counsel who were giving this remarkable legal advice? These legal avengers, these legal eagles—who were they? Was the shadow Attorney-General part of the crack team? I'm beginning to suspect not, because, when the pivotal press conference happened, he was spookily absent—or present with his invisibility coat on. So who were they? Who were the lawyers that read the Canavan decision and then provided advice to the Leader of the Opposition that she was a rolled-gold sure thing to be found eligible? We need to know. It is now a matter of consumer protection. Our constituents need to know who not to go to for legal advice in the future. You can't trust him on the law. You can't trust him on the economy. You can't trust him on the budget. It is shifty, shifty, shifty.</span>

They have not got any warmer in opposition than they were in government. When those opposite were in government, they recklessly spent. The thing about the Labor Party is this: when they're in government, it's always someone else's fault, despite the fact that they had $150-a-tonne iron ore prices and global growth running at high rates. It wasn't because of the Labor Party that the revenue fell out; it was always someone else's fault. But back in 2007, when the Liberal Party and the National Party were in government, the member for Lilley and others used to say, 'It's only going so well in the economy because they've got so terribly, terribly lucky.' And we've been hearing it from them again when we've been talking now about the stronger economy that has been built under this government. They're saying: 'It's all about what's happening overseas. They're all just getting so terribly, terribly lucky again.' Well, what I've noticed is that, every time the Australian people vote Liberal and National, they get a lot luckier; the economy gets a lot luckier. So, I've got one response: vote Liberal and National and get lucky!</span>

This budget delivers the essential services that Australians rely on. We are protecting Australians through the Australian Defence Force. That is one of the essential services the government provides. This budget continues to support the ADF and confirms the $200 billion build-up of our military capability over the next 10 years, the largest build-up of that capability in our peacetime history. We are using that heft to drive jobs and growth in the economy like never before, and that has shown up in the Performance of Manufacturing Index as recently as this month. There have been 19 months of continuous growth in manufacturing in Australia, the longest period since 2005, and, in March this year, it was the highest expansion on record. Our defence industry investment, which is protecting Australia and guaranteeing the security of Australians, is also driving our economy. That is a very good outcome.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistency is the hallmark of this government's approach to government policy. It has characterised this government for the last five years. But the approach of the Leader of the Opposition has been characterised by narcissistic self-interest throughout his entire political career. On this side is a consistency of approach. On the Labor side, from the Leader of the Opposition, we have a narcissistic self-interested approach. This has been manifested time and time again, and his caucus colleagues know it. That's why he has a Faustian pact with the CFMEU. I assume he gave them a rolled-gold guarantee to be their cat's paw in this parliament. He sold the Cleanevent workers down the river in order to get more power for the ALP. I assume he gave the Cleanevent workers a rolled-gold guarantee that he'd take care of them and put their interests first.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most recently, we've seen him sell down the river the three members of parliament who resigned today over their citizenship issues, because he vastly overreached on the citizenship question. For the last six months, he knew that he had three members of parliament sitting in this House who were ineligible to be here. The Leader of the Opposition, because of his own narrow self-interest, has humiliated those three members of parliament—publicly humiliated them. I assume he gave them a rolled-gold guarantee that he'd put their interests ahead of his own, but he didn't. That's the hallmark of this Leader of the Opposition. His caucus colleagues know it; they're starting to say it. And I'm afraid the Leader of the Opposition's political career is starting to have the smell of death of about it.</span>

Is the Prime Minister aware that, on Sky News today, the CEO of the Grattan Institute said the government's income tax scheme includes 'a small tax cut for low-income earners' and 'a very large tax cut for high-income earners'? Can the Prime Minister detect a pattern here? Is this why the Prime Minister won't give a straight answer on the cost of his policies?</span>

It is very, very clear that the tax relief goes to, in the first instance, people on low and middle incomes, and subsequently it goes to the broad range of income earners other than those. Of course, the rate that is not affected is the 45 per cent rate, and the threshold is lifted to $200,000 in seven years time. The 10-year cost has been given already by the Treasurer, but the point is that the income tax system remains, in terms of the distribution of the burden, as it is today, where the largest share of the tax is paid by those on higher incomes. I refer the honourable member to the answer I gave the member for Melbourne a moment ago.</span>

The government takes very seriously, as the Australian people do, the protection of our borders. We want to make sure that we can bring people to our country safely. We want to make sure that we can assess the risk when people are applying for a visa, whether they're coming here through the humanitarian and refugee program or whether they're coming here on a business or tourist visa. We want to make sure we can do everything within our power to keep Australians safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, it is a fact, and the Australian public remembers this very well, that when Labor were in government they completely lost control of our borders. Eight hundred boats arrived, 1,200 people tragically drowned at sea and 50,000 people came through; 17 detention centres opened and thousands of children went into detention. We know now, as a result of the latest figures provided in the budget this week, that this disaster, presided over by Labor, has now cost us $16 billion. The Australian taxpayers, who are working hard, who are struggling to pay their energy bills at the moment and who are struggling to pay the bills associated with their household, have been ripped off by $16 billion, thanks to the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would have thought that that would have been enough, given that this government has restored integrity to our borders and given that we have stopped those boats. We've turned back 32 boats with 800 people on them over the course of the last couple of years, we've not had a death at sea and we have security in our border system. You would have thought that the Labor Party may have learned something over the course of that period, but they haven't. The Australian public heard the Leader of the Opposition say that he would adopt the coalition policy and that there would be no difference between the Liberal Party policy and the Labor Party policy, but, as usual, he didn't tell the truth to the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This person, who aspires to be the leader of our country, has deceived workers in this country, when they were ripped off when he was bargaining on their behalf and at the same time his union was accepting payments from the bosses. We know that his colleagues have been deceived and doublecrossed by him over his entire working career. We know that he will say or do anything. We know that he can never, ever be trusted. He can't go to this election saying that the Labor Party has the same policy as the coalition when it comes to border protection. He said that at the last election, and they have spent every day since crab-walking back from that position. There is now a majority of caucus members who are opposed to Operation Sovereign Borders. This Leader of the Opposition couldn't lie straight in bed, and the Australian public well and truly know that by now.</span>

I can confirm that, in 2015-16, those in the top tax bracket paid 30.3 per cent of all personal income tax collected, and, under the government's plan, Treasury estimates that those in the top tax bracket will pay around 36 per cent of all personal income tax collected in 2024-25. As the Prime Minister was pointing out before, someone earning $205,000 will be earning five times more but paying 13 times more tax. Under this plan, the progressivity of our tax system is well protected and well respected.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the Labor Party is they don't understand that this country was not built on envy and bitterness, and our tax system shouldn't be built on envy and bitterness either. Those opposite, the Labor Party, think that the only way that people on low and middle incomes can do better is if they make people on other incomes do worse. This is the flat-earth thinking that chokes economies. That's why the Labor Party cannot be trusted to run what is estimated to be, over the next four years, a $2 trillion economy. I wouldn't trust the Leader of the Opposition with $2, and yet he walks round here, thumping himself about on issues of rolled-gold guarantees. He might think he is the gold member of this parliament, but he is a rolled-gold failure as a member of this parliament.</span>

The Liberal and National government is investing more than $75 billion, a record, through a 10-year infrastructure pipeline. Victorians will benefit from our commitment of $12.9 billion to key projects, including $5 billion for the Melbourne Airport rail link, linking Tullamarine to the CBD; $235 million towards North East rail; $1.75 billion towards the Victorian North East Link; and $475 million towards planning and preconstruction work for Monash rail.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing everywhere, including a little further south, in Tasmania, building on our prior commitments such as a $400 million investment in the Midland Highway upgrade. This budget provided an additional $920.8 million to major projects in the Apple Isle, including $400 million under the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative to fund works, including the Bass Highway; a further $59.8 million to deliver a second tranche of the Freight Rail Revitalisation Program; and $25 million for the Scottsdale irrigation project. I was there just the other day. Those farmers are delighted. Additional investment through programs such as Roads to Recovery and the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages have seen electorates such as Braddon receive millions of dollars in additional funding thanks to the Liberal-National federal government and the state Liberal government. This creates more job opportunities and improves road safety. Premier Hodgman said:</span>

We mightn't be rolling out gold on our roads, but we're certainly rolling out a lot of bitumen. He said he had a rolled-gold process for preselections, and look what happened. Labor's numbers are shortening by the day. The member for Maribyrnong's support is shortening by the day. He said he'd back coal workers in Queensland; he said a completely different thing in the Batman by-election. What on earth will he say in the by-elections he now faces? He can't be trusted with citizenship or with government, and the people know it.</span>

Under the revised tax scales, at the end of the seven-year plan, the 45c threshold comes in at $200,000, so the marginal tax rate thereon is 45c in the dollar plus the Medicare levy. The 32½c marginal rate goes from $41,000 to $200,000. I refer honourable members to the Grattan Institute's report, which they quoted from earlier, which says:</span>

I commend him for that. It is so critically important to ensure those people in Australia who work hard and save diligently for their retirement have their savings protected, and that is what the Turnbull government is focused on. We are seeing, though, that young people in particular have their superannuation accounts whittled away by excessive fees and charges. The current system also sees millions of Australians unable to take advantage of the impact of long-term compound savings. Their savings have been spread across multiple accounts because they are unable, due to enterprise bargaining agreements and the like, to consolidate them. This must be fixed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Protecting Your Super package will defend the superannuation savings of millions of Australians by capping certain fees and banning others. We are improving insurance arrangements by stopping young Australians, those with balances below $6,000 and those with inactive accounts from being saddled with insurance that they don't need, can't claim on and didn't ask for. We are protecting those Australians who have forgotten accounts—money they have saved and set aside but no longer have access to—by proactively reuniting those people with their money. Combined with our personal income tax plan announced in this budget, Australians, and young Australians in particular, will be tens of thousands of dollars better off throughout their working life and in their retirement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just us on this side that recognise that. Consumer advocates such as CHOICE, along with numerous other consumer groups, have backed our superannuation reforms. They have said that billions will flow back to consumers, away from the bottom line of the big banks and the life insurers, and, they've said, for individuals, it will mean tens of thousands of dollars more in their savings. Now this is fair.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But tonight the Leader of the Opposition has a real test of character. He has a chance to show the Australian people whether or not he actually believes in his rhetoric about fairness. He has to show tonight whether he is more than just talk or he will in fact back in these fair reforms. I suspect that he won't. And why won't he? Because he was the chief architect of the mess that has been created and that we are fixing up, when he was Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. The Turnbull government will protect your money. They won't.</span>

Why was the Prime Minister willing to separately legislate different stages of the government's corporate tax cuts but unwilling to do the same for tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners? Why is it always one rule for big business and another for low- and middle-income earners? Isn't the Prime Minister the only person standing in the way of tax cuts for ordinary Australians from 1 July?</span>

That's what they're saying. They've been shifty all week on this—as shifty as the Leader of the Opposition. They're hedging their bets; they're saying, 'We'll support this; maybe we'll support that.' The Australian people just want a straight answer from the Labor Party: 'Do you support lower taxes for all Australians'—a simple question—'or are you going to be stuck in your rut of envy and bitterness and want to punish Australians who are just working hard and seeking to get on?' The Labor Party, when it comes to tax, are rolled-gold failures—absolute rolled-gold failures. And they're led by a rolled-gold failure.</span>

She is absolutely right. A strong economy is essential to provide the funding for record Medicare support. It's essential to record hospitals funding. It's essential to record mental healthcare funding. It's essential to record medical research funding. It's essential to be able to ensure that Australians get the medicines that they are entitled to when the medical experts recommend that something should go on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As the Prime Minister said, since we came to office there are 1,500 new or amended listings on the PBS—one per day on average. That's $9 billion worth of new drugs on our watch, in our time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, just this morning, I met a woman from the Canberra area, Lisa Keogh. Lisa has advanced breast cancer and has been given access to a particular drug, Kisqali. Kisqali has not, until now, been on the PBS. It is a drug which would cost women $70,000 a year—beyond the reach of the vast majority of women in Australia. Now, as of the announcement made on budget night, 3,150 women in Australia, as part of a $700 million listing—I'm advised the third largest listing by value in Australian history—will have access to Kisqali for advanced and metastatic breast cancer. What Lisa said to me was that this drug had changed her prospect from having months to years and years and possibly a full measure of life. That is what we do as a government. That is what a strong economy allows us to do. That is what allows us to deliver on compassion and providing real access to real medicines. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked whether there were any alternatives. I did hear the opposition say, 'But this is just the ordinary course of the business of government.' It's funny that they say that, because, under them, it wasn't. They denied the new listing of drugs recommended by the medical experts. They rejected seven medicines that were fundamental—medicines for chronic pulmonary disorder, for asthma, for in vitro fertilisation, for endometriosis and for schizophrenia. You ask: why would anybody do that? Again, I don't think they're evil. I just think they're incompetent. They are economic incompetents. They couldn't manage the economy then, they couldn't manage an economy now and you wouldn't trust them to manage an economy in the future. If you can't manage the economy, you can't manage health. It's as simple as that. </span>

Before the budget, Australians were told the government would axe the cut to the energy supplement, announce 20,000 new home care places and invest billions more in aged care. Given none of this happened, hasn't the minister perpetuated a cruel hoax on older Australians? </span>

I would suggest that the member, firstly, read the portfolio budget statement in respect of page 193. That identifies the growth over the forward years. It is a $5 billion investment. When we consider—and let me go to another issue in this answer—a rolled-gold Treasurer had responsibility for setting the budgets in home care packages under the Living Longer, Living Better legislation, had he looked at the Australian population pyramid, he would have made a different judgement in respect of the amount that was required. The member for Lilley needed to take that into consideration. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have done is we have invested in aged care to the tune of $5 billion. We have increased the number of residential care beds. We have increased the number, in the forward years, of home care places. We are providing programs and services to regional Australia that have a better outcome for people living in the bush. Our budget figures are accurate. They are not zero. I would suggest to the member for Franklin that you read both my statement yesterday and the budget papers, because we are making a serious commitment to senior Australians in this nation across Commonwealth home programs, home care packages and residential care, plus those supporting measures which give them the quality of life that they deserve for the work that they have done for this nation. To scaremonger, fearmonger and create angst among senior Australians is not appropriate. I have people who have now said that they are not going into aged care because of the politicking that is occurring. Start to consider the needs of those who have the pathway into support services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our budget measures are increasing. If you look at each year, we increase by approximately $1 billion per year, and over the last four years we've increased the budget by $1 billion to make up for the deficit that was there when we came into government after a Labor government. There is a need for us to focus on their needs and to ensure that they are given the opportunities. Our budget increases are into the forward years. They are real for this coming year. They are real for all elements of living.</span>

And of course he's part of 'team Queensland', the Liberal-Nationals team delivering outcomes for their state and their community. The member for Fisher, together with the member for Fairfax, recently had a huge win for his community, securing a $390 million commitment for the Beerburrum to Nambour rail project, just one of the many wins that have been secured by the LNP team Queensland: $800 million for the Bruce Highway, Cooroy to Curra, section D—the member for Wide Bay—a huge win. And there is $500 million for Eight Mile Plains to Daisy Hill—the member for Forde and the member for Bonner—huge wins. Then there is $500 million for Varsity Lakes to Tugun—the member for McPherson—a huge win, supported by other members of the Gold Coast team LNP, the member for Moncrieff and the member for Fadden. There is $497.3 million for the Mackay Ring Road—the member for Dawson. There is the Bruce Highway at Murrumba Downs and Griffith—the member for Dickson and the member for Petrie. There was $390 million for Beerburrum to Nambour—an extremely important achievement for the members for Fisher and Fairfax.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, so important is it that it was recently described in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Caboolture Shire Herald</span> as both 'welcome' and 'important'. Now, the person who gave that quote was a little bit forgetful: she forgot to mention that so far Queensland Labor has not yet put any money on the table for Beerburrum to Nambour. We certainly hope they do so soon. But it's not surprising that she was a bit forgetful about that, because we know that she's forgetful about a few other things as well—she forgot she was a British citizen! So now the person who gave that quote is the ex-member for Longman. But it was good of her to recognise the extraordinary achievement of the member for Fisher and the member for Fairfax. The fact is that if you want infrastructure delivered in Queensland you need to go to team LNP. So I say to the people of Longman, you've got a great opportunity now. You can put somebody else into the LNP team Queensland and deliver even more infrastructure for Queensland, just as team LNP is doing such a terrific job of.</span>

It's great to talk about the needs of older Australians. It is important that we talk about the way in which governments provide services, and it's important that we use the resources effectively to provide choice within the mix of the total budget that we allocate. Our allocation of budget goes to very critical programs. In response to your question, we pay in residential care for beds occupied. We provide opportunities for home care packages that allow people to have choices to live at home. When you combine the efforts of the government, we are at least providing real choice that allows Australians to either live at home or make the choice to live in residential care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In doing that, what we considered was the forward years in terms of the number of places required in both. The number of residential beds required will continue to increase substantially. The number of home care packages will also increase in those out years. Our commitment is to make sure that across this nation, regionally and in capital cities, we give absolute choices to people. I want to identify resources that are best placed to give people that choice of home care or residential care.

He, like the member for Capricornia, the member for Dawson and the member for Flynn, is a great advocate on this side of the parliament for the Great Barrier Reef, a resilient reef which creates thousands of jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Great Barrier Reef is a natural wonder of the world, and it first went on the World Heritage List during the term of a coalition government—the Fraser government. It supports some 64,000 jobs; two million visitors go to the reef each year; and it contributes more than $6 billion a year to the Australian economy. The Turnbull government has announced the single largest investment in reef restoration and conservation in Australia's history, and I had the privilege, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of announcing this half-a-billion-dollar commitment. This half-a-billion-dollar commitment to the Barrier Reef was possible only because of the good economic management of the coalition. The money will go towards working with farmers so that we can reduce the pesticide, sediment and nitrogen run-off into the reef. It will go towards tackling the crown-of-thorns starfish, which has an insidious impact on the reef and has done enormous damage over the last three decades. We will work with the scientists to ensure that our coral can be heat resistant and light resistant to withstand some of the challenges it faces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our announcement has been welcomed by the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, and their CEO said, 'It underpins regional Queensland jobs and the economy.' The Great Barrier Reef Foundation said that this was 'an unequalled opportunity'. The Mayor of Gladstone Regional Council said this was a 'fantastic announcement'. The Chief Scientist of Australia said of the coalition's announcement that it was 'an extraordinary day for science'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while the Labor Party left the coalition five dredging and disposal projects that were planned for the marine park, we cancelled them all; and, while, under the Labor Party, the reef went on the endangered watchlist, we in turn have put in place a Reef 2050 plan with a $2 billion investment, and we have now made the single largest investment in Australia's history in reef conservation and protection. Protecting the environment is a coalition legacy, and only under the coalition will the reef continue to create the jobs that it does now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Australian Task Force commander called those battles some of the heaviest fighting that the Task Force ever undertook.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty-six Australians made the supreme sacrifice in 3½ weeks at Coral and Balmoral. A hundred Australians were wounded. Five New Zealanders and five American soldiers were also wounded. At least 270 of the Vietnamese forces were killed, although we'll never know, of course, the true figure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral are not widely known in Australia, yet they are among the most important of our country's long commitment to the war in Vietnam. We remember all of those who served in those battles of Coral and Balmoral. We remember all of the Australians who served in Vietnam. We honour all of the Australians who have served, to fight and die to secure the freedoms we enjoy in this parliament. It is no accident that we look across the lake at the Australian War Memorial that honours the sacrifice of those men and women. Over 100,000 through all the generations have made the supreme sacrifice to keep us free, and their descendants are doing so today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday there will be a memorial service at the Vietnam Forces National Memorial to honour the veterans of the battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral. At that service I know that all will remember that the best way to honour the veterans, whether of the Vietnam War or of a century ago in the trenches of Flanders—the best way to honour those men and women who fought, served and died—is to support the service men and women, the veterans and their families of today.</span>

In welcoming you we pay tribute to your 26 brothers who never returned home and the 100 who were wounded over this 3½-week battle. Indeed, we also pay tribute to the 60,000 Australians who served in the Vietnam conflict. Many of the nashos were barely 20 and the regulars often enlisted at 19. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also acknowledge that all too often in those weeks and months after young Australians had fought for their lives many found themselves back here in Australia. The conflict you fought in was hard to imagine, but it's hard to imagine also coming back here, being demobilised, handing back your rifle and your pay book, and being plunged straight back into civilian life, with no counselling, no rehabilitation and no attempt to reconcile what you had endured in the realities of war with the realities of civilian life. It is the hard truth as we approach the memorial this weekend that too many Australians were sent into jungle dark and they were shunned on their return.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These words of a serviceman are inscribed on the Vietnam memorial, not very far from where we are here now: 'I don't seem to have many friends since I came home. If you weren't there—you can't understand.' You remind us today, gentlemen, that not only did we fail to understand then but, with a few noble exceptions, we failed to try. You remind us, gentlemen, that for too long Australia closed its eyes and its heart to our Vietnam veterans. Thank you, Bill, Harry and all those who served in that conflict. We renew our most sacred promise: lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  I have a short statement about some housekeeping matters for this evening with respect to the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply speech. As I outlined on Tuesday, the usual courtesies of course apply to the Leader of the Opposition's speech, as they did with the Treasurer's. As with last year, I think the House conducted itself well on Tuesday evening. Again, with respect to this evening, as with all proceedings, the Leader of the Opposition will have the call and is entitled to speak without interruption. Again, if I'm required to make use of standing order 94(a), it will be in accordance with the same arrangements, where it will be by written note and the required member will need to leave the chamber immediately.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have just one other matter. This is some experience that I've had over the last few budget speeches. Both the Clerk and I sometimes get notes or queries right near the end of the speech where the time on the clock has expired. I want to address this in advance for members. Standing order 1 provides that there is no time limit at all for the Treasurer's speech or the Leader of the Opposition's speech. In fact, they are the only speeches where there is no time limit. The clock is there merely for guidance for each of the speakers. I just want to point that out in the nicest possible way, because in the last few years I've had a few queries and I wouldn't want to point it out on budget night or during the Leader of the Opposition's speech. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  I have this little quote up on the wall of my office, and I printed it off for a few of my staff as well. It's a quote from John Dewey, and he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've loved that quote for many years because I think it really does tell us what our responsibility as members of parliament is when we're planning for, investing in and making decisions about what kind of society we want, what our budget priorities should be and what our education system should look like. I think about what my parents wanted for me. My parents both left school very early. Their education was disrupted by the Second World War. They were intelligent people who never had the opportunity that I and my brothers had to go to university. We were the first of our family—the first generation—to go to university. I also think about the parents that I meet in my travels around the country. Every single one of them will tell you what they want for their kids is that they get a great education so that they can have secure work in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are proud of our investment in universities and the big changes we made with the demand-driven system—unravelled by those opposite—but we have always seen a TAFE education as equally important, equally valuable and equally valid. We know that, in the next few years, nine out of 10 jobs created in our economy will need either a university education or a TAFE education, and we want our university system and our TAFE system to be strong, equal partners in educating not only young Australians but also those Australians who are going back to study after time out of the workforce or because the jobs that they trained for 10, 20 and 30 years ago don't exist anymore. There are new and different jobs that will require new and different skills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see a strong TAFE system, but is that what we've seen from those opposite? Absolutely not. We've now seen more than $3 billion cut from TAFE and training in this country. We've seen programs like the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program cut; the Productive Ageing through Community Education program cut; the Apprentice to Business Owner Program cut; the Workplace English Language and Literacy program—you'd think that would be pretty important—cut; and the National Partnership Agreement on Training Places for Single and Teenage Parents cut. How can we build the workforce of the future when we're cutting billions from our training programs? This year, you'd think they'd have taken the opportunity in this election-focused budget to actually do something to reverse some of these cuts. No, they've cut another $270 million from our TAFE system. The Skilling Australians Fund that was announced in last year's budget was set to cost $1.47 billion over four years. Guess what it shows up as in this year's budget? $1.2 billion. If anyone opposite can explain to me why there is $270 million less for TAFE and apprenticeships and training in this fund alone then I'd love to hear it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this fund is likely to see its funding fall even further in coming years. And, as I said, that comes on top of years of cuts from those opposite. We actually have 140,000 fewer apprentices today than when those opposite came to power. They talk about skills shortages and about why they have to have temporary skilled migration. After five years, we've got 140,000 fewer apprentices, and right across the country we've seen Liberal state governments closing TAFE campuses. TAFE campuses closed in Dapto, Petersham West and Crows Nest due to the New South Wales Liberals, in Ithaca in Queensland, in Newport in Victoria—the list is very long. Courses have been scaled back and fees have increased, and I tell you what: employers are noticing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you ask employers what's happening with TAFE and training in Australia today, they will tell you that they are finding it harder to place their workers in appropriate courses. They are dissatisfied, particularly in regional and rural areas, with the level of support and the range of training that are available for their staff. Investment in infrastructure, so important in vocational education, has also declined. You can't learn a vocation on the equipment that people were using a generation ago or two generations ago. We have to keep our facilities in TAFE up to date so that people are learning on the same equipment that the industry is using in the workplace. The hours of training delivered by TAFE have fallen by over 30 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at some of the occupations that have been on the skills shortage list for years: bricklayer, carpenter, cook, hairdresser. They've been on that National Skills Needs List for the entire time that those opposite have been in government. How can that be okay? It doesn't take that long to train a cook, to train a hairdresser or to train a bricklayer. If those opposite had started training cooks and bricklayers and hairdressers when they came to government, those occupations wouldn't be on the skills shortage list today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a different approach. We say that $2 out of every $3 spent on vocational education by the Commonwealth should go to TAFE because it is TAFE, public TAFE, that should be at the centre of our training system to make sure that we have the quality and that we can deliver to the places that need them most and the people who need them most. We've said that we will provide 10,000 pre-apprentice programs for young people who want to learn a trade and 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who need to retrain. We've said that we'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. We committed last year to reversing the government's cuts. We've said, very importantly, that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects will be filled by Australian apprentices and trainees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are prepared to invest in productivity-enhancing infrastructure around the country—the new roads, the new railway lines, the new port facilities, airport upgrades—all of those things that we have committed to in the past; we know that Commonwealth dollars will go to them. Let's make sure that we are seeing apprentices and trainees employed on those projects. I can tell you—I know you know this, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan—it is frustrating that many of the big employers of apprentices in the past just don't do it anymore. You will remember that big companies and big Commonwealth entities—the old Postmaster-General and so on—used to employ hundreds of apprentices, thousands. They don't anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of investing in TAFE, in apprentices, in traineeships and in training the next generation of young Australians and retraining Australians in the workforce today for the jobs of tomorrow, in this budget the government have locked in their previous cuts and they have added to them—a further $270 million cut. It tells you all you need to know about the priorities of those opposite that they can find $80 billion to give to big business—overseas shareholders—but they can't find the money to properly fund TAFE and trainees and apprentices. It tells you all you need to know about those opposite that they can find $17 billion to give to the big banks but they can't find the money to properly fund education and training for young Australians. I am proud to stand up in front of the roomfuls of people I meet when I'm out in our electorates—and in your electorates too, I'll tell you what—and tell them that we will invest in TAFE, in public TAFE, in training and in apprentices, because we know that Australia's economic security depends on it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230886" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  If Labor is ever returned to government in this country, God help vocational education. They have the most appalling record in vocational education. I am very happy to stand here today and take you through, in detail, what they have done to bring this sector to its knees. Labor's record in vocational education, when in government, was appalling. Between 2011 and 2013, Labor ripped $1.2 billion out of vocational education—$1.2 billion over a two-year period. Nine times between 2011 and 2013 they cut employer incentives to take on an apprentice—$1.2 billion and nine successive cuts over a two-year period. During that time, 2011 to 2013, 190,000 apprentices were lost to industry. During Labor's last year in government alone, they oversaw the single biggest decline in apprenticeship numbers. We lost over 100,000 apprentices-in-training to industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the previous speech I heard it said that some of those apprentices lost to the system would have been trained by now, and that's right—100,000 of those who came out of that system in 2012-13 would have been qualified. They would have been out there in the workforce using their skills, but they had the opportunity ripped away from them—taken away, no chance, their dreams removed. Their opportunity for a worthwhile, fulfilling career in their choice of industry was ripped away by the Labor government, which took $1.2 billion from vocational education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's actually quite telling to look at who the responsible minister was during that time. From December 2011 to July 2013 the responsible minister was the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. There was a title change to Minister for Workplace Relations from 1 July 2013 to 18 September 2013. The minister responsible for such a significant number of apprentices coming out of the system was the member for Maribyrnong. I would be so embarrassed if I were a member of the Labor Party, sitting in here, understanding that $1.2 billion and the decimation of the vocational education sector in Australia occurred under that watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has an absolutely appalling track record in vocational education. In 2012, they negotiated a five-year National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. They negotiated it with the states and territories. It was a $1.75 billion, five-year partnership. Of that, $1.15 billion went to reforms in the sector. Those reforms introduced contestability into the market, so they provided for the competition between TAFE and private providers. They were introduced in the 2012 to 2017 five-year agreement between the Labor government and the states. The reforms that introduced contestability between TAFE and the private providers meant that the market share of TAFEs dropped over that period from 60 per cent to 49 per cent. So, under the five-year agreement negotiated by Labor, the market share of TAFE dropped by 11 per cent—an appalling track record. Of the $1.75 billion that they had in their five-year national partnership agreement with the states, $1.15 billion went to the reforms on contestability, which dropped the market share of TAFEs, and $600 million out of that $1.75 billion went to a direct training outcome. So it was only $600 million over five years, which is clearly not a lot of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have is the red team opposite contributing $600 million to training outcomes over five years and, over this side, we have the blue team contributing $1.5 billion over five years. Six hundred million dollars or $1.5 billion? I know where I want to be. I want to be supporting vocational education and injecting $1.5 billion into direct training outcomes. Three hundred million dollars of that is on the table this year. It's there to deal with projects and address the decline in apprentice numbers, which we know are there, because they were established back in 2012-13 when we had the biggest single drop in apprentice numbers. We're working with the states and the territories and, quite frankly, there are some states that are ahead of the pack. I can assure you that I am looking forward to continuing some very, very fruitful negotiations with a number of states. I will single out the new Liberal government in South Australia, which have been very quick to come and speak with me about the proposals that they took to the election—proposals that they developed earlier this year, and towards the end of last year, I believe, to address the significant shortfall that they have, as an incoming government, in the number of apprentices in training. I am very confident that we will be reaching agreement with South Australia in the very near future. The Commonwealth and South Australia will work together to make sure that we are addressing the skills needs in South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some states have been less interested in talking about how to address skills needs. If I look at what's happened in Victoria, particularly over the last few years, I can see that there has been a significant drop in the funding contribution from the Victorian state government to vocational education. Over a five-year period, their funding for vocational education has reduced by over 50 per cent. So the state government in Victoria dropped their funding. If we look at the last three years alone—effectively from 2014 to 2017—we can see that $250 million has been ripped out of Victoria in vocational education and training. So, in fact, we are injecting more federal money than the state governments, individually and collectively, have injected. Victoria has the most significant drop in spending over a five-year period of all of the states. My door continues to be open to every state and territory to make sure that we can work together to address the skills shortages that we have around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the minute that I have left to speak on this particular MPI today, I must say that it's very interesting that Labor has actually put up vocational education as an MPI, because since the last election this is the first time we have spoken about vocational education. However, at every opportunity I get I certainly speak about vocational education, so I have had the opportunity during MPIs to talk about VET. As a government, we have already done a range of things to address the problems we inherited from the Labor government. Getting rid of VET FEE-HELP is so important for the future of vocational education, and particularly for the reputation of the sector. We fixed that with VET student loans. We have introduced strategies to deal with the status of vocational education because we know we've got a lot of work to do to make sure vocational education takes its place as an opportunity for our young people to get the jobs that they need. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:40</span>):  That was a staggering contribution from the assistant minister. There were 10 minutes allotted to the government minister, and the only point at which they actually talked about their own reforms was in the last 30 seconds. The last 30 seconds was all we got.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HUSIC:</span>
                  </a>  No, because your time, Minister, was actually the bulk of the contribution that you should have made. What was in the bulk of the contribution? A throwback to years before. The coalition have been in government for nearly five years. They had the opportunity to say what they were doing, but all they could focus on was the past, as is often the case. Why? Because it is a complete distraction from their inability to get this right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In actual fact, what this government is doing on education, in terms of its failure to invest in skill, is intergenerationally reprehensible because it will deny the next generation of Australians what they require in terms of an investment in human capital. We know what's going to happen in work. We know what technology is going to do to profoundly change the way in which people work, and we know we need to invest in human capital right now. We need smarter Australians and more skilled Australians. We need them to have that level of support that requires that investment in human capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we get out of the coalition? In that environment where we need to invest, we get cuts to schools. In the environment where we need to lift skills, we get cuts to TAFE. In the environment where we need to prepare them for the future, we get cuts to universities. There have been cuts to schools, cuts to TAFE and cuts to uni by the government. We often hear when they talk about Gonski that it's about spending smarter, yet this is what they're doing: they are cutting the funding to education and then puncturing the budget with a massive hole, with an $80 billion handover of funds to corporate Australia through corporate tax cuts. Those are the very same businesses that are crying out for skills and wanting to see investments in people, yet this mob want to cut $80 billion out of the budget for corporate tax cuts. It gives you every sense of their priorities in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at what they are doing to schools, with $17 billion cut, or universities, with billions cut. In particular, during the course of this government, while the coalition have been in office, $3 billion has been cut out of TAFE. As was indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition earlier, when you know that nine out of 10 positions in the Australian workforce are going to need someone trained through either TAFE or university, how do you cut $3 billion out of TAFE during the course of a government? That's why the minister didn't talk about what they are doing—because their record is so shabby, shameful and scandalous. They cut $3 billion. In this budget, what are they going to do? They are prepared to cut another $300 million. It's not enough that they cut $3 billion out; they're ready to cut another $300 million over four years. It is absolutely a disgrace. There are 140,000 fewer apprentices in this country, and we are being told all the time that there are skills shortages. How do you get away with that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are jobs programs that are supposed to prepare young people for work. There used to be a time when you'd always hear about Work for the Dole or PaTH, the internship program, from those opposite. It would always be in the budget, but in this one there is no mention whatsoever—no mention of what funding or what support they are providing young people to get them in jobs. The only good thing that comes out of PaTH is plasticine statistics; they are always squeezing the stats. They're always shaping them up and massaging them one way or another. You can never find out how many interns actually got jobs. Eighty per cent per cent of people who go through Work for the Dole don't have a job three months after. All that young people got in this budget was roughly $1 million for a youth employment body. That was it. That's all that you got out of those opposite. They're not preparing young people for work; they're punishing them for being out of work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you look at what's happening in terms of the future of work itself: 3.5 million jobs in Australia will be affected by technological change. In a workforce of 12 million, that's big. We get nothing out of those opposite in terms of preparing people for what's going to happen. TAFE has a huge role, particularly in the middle of people's careers, in getting them new skills and preparing them for new jobs. This is why I say that what is happening on skills under those opposite is intergenerationally reprehensible. They are selling out young people and their futures, all for the sake of handing over an $80 billion corporate tax cut. It is a disgrace. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  Can I say from the outset, as one of the few people in this place that actually holds a trade certificate as an electrical fitter mechanic, as someone who completed an apprenticeship, who had that opportunity in their youth, that we are very keen to see that opportunity extended to the youth of this generation. I notice that it's all about blame shifting and all those other things, but I'd like to point out to the member for Chifley that the assistant minister made a very clear point: a national partnership agreement was signed for five years. It takes five years to expire. This is the ultimate reason why we continue to be affected by Labor's decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also congratulate the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills. She is doing outstanding work. She is not a mechanical fitter, but she is a mechanical engineer, which is close enough. She has certainly worked with engineering services and trades across a long, broad and very extensive round of experience in that field and many others. She is doing incredibly important work in this portfolio. As part of that role she came to my electorate of Hinkler in recent weeks. We were fortunate to visit a place called Superior Pak and one of their organisers, Mark Hamilton. Can I say how pleased I was to see how successful this business was. A place which used to manufacture harvesters—it was the home of Austoft for many years—is now the home of Superior Pak, where they produce many of the nation's recycling trucks and rubbish trucks. They employ a large number of apprentices. It was good to be back on the ground with oxycutters and grinders and all those things that you see inside those trade related engineering services, and it was good to have the assistant minister with us to demonstrate what we are doing locally. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's beyond ridiculous that those opposite want to lecture us about what's good and bad inside the VET sector, because the assistant minister was exactly right: Labor's record on vocational education and training is, quite simply, appalling. Because of what was called at the time their grand plan—I would say it was probably a rolled-gold grand plan, given today's theme—</span>

                  </a>  with the same sort of success, as I just heard from an interjection, they introduced private educators and competition into the sector. It's no surprise to me, as someone that comes from business, that that created a difficult position for TAFE. Their numbers went down and consequently their funding went down and there are now fewer of them. That is no surprise to me. The federal government does not directly fund TAFE. The coalition provides $1½ billion to states and territories to support their VET sectors. That grand plan of Labor's saw hundreds of millions of dollars cut from incentive programs. Apprentice numbers collapsed across the country, and this is now a real threat to our businesses, our industry and our economy. Through the hard work of my good friend and colleague, the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, we are taking steps. We have ended the rorts in the VET FEE-HELP system. We are looking to restore integrity and public confidence in VET, so that students and their families can be confident they are on the path to a rewarding job and career. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed the member for Chifley talking about the PaTH program. I was with one of the success stories in recent weeks. He is a young beau who works for the Bundaberg Motor Group. He, with two of his compatriots who were successful through the PaTH program, secured full-time employment. The best thing, he said, was he could buy a car. As a young man with a full-time job through the PaTH program, he could buy a car. He was excited about that. It is a great result. The $1½ billion Skilling Australians Fund will continue to do that. It will provide an extra 300,000 apprentices and trainees over four years. That is 300,000 new opportunities for Australians to gain those skilled jobs, for us to provide our youth with an opportunity that they need to continue to build their skills and experience across our sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some of the programs that we've introduced under the government that support VET and apprentices. Unfortunately, while the federal government has increased funding to the sector, most states are cutting theirs. We need everyone onboard. This is a critical issue for me, as a local member, as our numbers have clearly fallen for apprentices. We are providing those opportunities. I look forward to the skills fund being introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government does have a positive plan to raise the profile and the status of vocational education and training. Whilst I've earned a living with my hands and I've earned a living with my mind, not everyone needs to go to university. Not everyone needs a university education. There are very highly paid, well-paid, well-developed jobs with trades across the country, but, to get those positions, we need our youth to have an opportunity. This government is providing those opportunities—300,000 of them. I'm looking forward to seeing them being engaged, being employed in business, completing their apprenticeships and getting into the workforce and not only delivering for themselves and their families but also building our economy, paying their taxes as good citizens and being part of a great Australia in the future.</span>

He is one of tens of thousands of people of his generation who got access to an apprenticeship because, back then, the federal government used to fund apprenticeships. Back then, the federal government owned railway yards and built things. Back then, the federal government owned the Australian defence industries and employed apprentices. That is why Labor is committed to going some way to restoring that by guaranteeing that one in 10 of the employees on government projects will be an apprentice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know hundreds and hundreds of people of the same generation who started out at the old ordnance factory in Bendigo. They got their apprenticeship as a fitter and turner. They're proud of that. They've done well. Some have gone on to be local councillors. Some continued to work there and were acknowledged not that long ago for their 45 or 50 years of service at Bendigo Thales. Do you know what's heartbreaking? This government signed the new Hawkei contract out at Bendigo Thales, but guess what? It didn't lock in any apprentice ratios. So guess what happened—$1.6 billion for the Hawkei contract and not one new apprentice, because this government did a contract with a for-profit, private enterprise and didn't lock in a commitment to apprentices. That is the track record of this government. It has cut so much money from apprenticeships and TAFE that it is now hard to find a decent apprenticeship which is well funded and which people can do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also said that, somehow, Victoria is underfunding TAFE or not funding it. Maybe they should have read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> last week or actually seen the commitments that the state Labor government made for the people of Victoria. They actually announced free TAFE. Maybe that's why the government didn't understand it! It was because we had a state Labor government offer free TAFE. That is $172 million towards free TAFE because we have a state Labor government putting TAFE first. That's maybe what the government have a problem with. Labor invests in TAFE. Labor believes in TAFE and will always be the party that stands up for TAFE. There was $60 million also announced last week for a new TAFE campus in Bendigo. It's another chunk of money from a state Labor government in TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victorian Labor is not the only Labor state government that is doing that. We've seen significant investments in Queensland and in WA. Labor puts TAFE first, so you can imagine the anger on this side of the House when we learnt on budget night that the government have yet again taken the axe to TAFE. This time they've cut $270 million from TAFE, from the Skilling Australians Fund, in their budget. Last year they said that in the budget there'd be $1.47 billion over four years. In this budget, it is $1.2 billion. They're cutting funding. This fund is about seeing where we have skills gaps in this country, where we have 457 visa workers in this country, and charging the employers a fee—and that goes into training. If we're going to close the gap, if we want to reduce the number of temporary skilled migrants that we have coming into this country, then we have to invest in TAFE. We have to offer those apprenticeships, and we have to make sure that there are courses available. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really concerning that the government doesn't understand that connection. It's really concerning that they're not backing Labor's plan to guarantee that two-thirds of all vocational education funding will go into TAFE. It's really concerning that they're not backing our commitment to one-in-10 apprenticeship ratios in all government contracts, guaranteeing that we do have that next generation of skilled people going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've lost count of the number of employers in regional Australia that I've met who are struggling to find fitters and turners, who are struggling to find people with the traditional trades, whether they be mechanics or people involved in any form of automation or in our building trades. We are struggling as a country. This funding that the government has cut would have gone some way to bridging the gap. It wasn't the only thing, but it was helping. It says a lot about a government when they cut TAFE funding and say loudly and clearly to the rest of the economy, 'That's okay, just keep bringing in temporary skilled workers.' They have no commitment to giving young people a go. They've got no commitment to ensuring that our TAFEs stand up as the trusted, publicly funded way of delivering vocational education in this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  Politics is a funny thing. You know that some days will be better than others and some weeks will be better than others. I think everybody in this House, across the divide here, would agree that the Leader of the Opposition, this week, is having an absolute shocker. At the end of the day, we know that he's not a very well liked bloke—and I feel for him in that regard—nor is he trusted. But, as has been emphasised by others, we have been reminded today that he did make the rolled-gold commitment, that guarantee, that none of his team in the Labor Party would be engaged in the citizenship saga, and, of course, four have had to resign. Four cannot sit in this parliament. He's been caught out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think, at a time like this, his team would fall in behind him and give him a bit of support because the man is on his knees. Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has brought this MPI to the House for debate. She's put on the House's agenda a debate about vocational education and training. She knows, as the loyal deputy, that her leader failed disastrously as the minister for employment. In his last gig as a minister of a government, 110,000 apprentices were lost from the system. So, the loyal deputy comes in and says: 'Let's tell Australia about it. Let's again shine a light on the Leader of the Opposition's absolute incompetence.' That's why he should never be Prime Minister. And the Leader of the Opposition's deputy probably doesn't want him to be either, because she wants the gig. I think that's actually why we're here today; I think that's why we're debating this. Why else would the Labor Party put up an MPI about getting jobs, when we have a record job-making government right now? We have over 1,000 jobs being created every single day, and they want to talk about jobs! I think they're out for the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if they want to talk about history, let's talk about history. The Labor Party in government introduced two schemes, which we had to inherit because they were partnership agreements. One of those schemes was the National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. We recently replaced Labor's national partnership agreement with the Skilling Australians Fund. We also replaced Labor's VET FEE-HELP program with the VET Students Loans scheme. Let's take both of those schemes of the Labor Party. The national partnership agreement effectively disconnected the vocational education and training sector from the real market economy. A sector that provided the training was disconnected from the very industries that accepted the graduates. And Labor did this purposely, not by an accidental rule of the pencil or the pen. Labor reduced the incentives for employers nine times. A total of $1.2 billion of incentives for employers, encouraging them to take on people out of the VET system, was gone from the system, disconnecting the real economy from the suppliers of vocational education and training. What was the end result? The end result was young people in Australia being trained and having debt, but no job—no job, but debt. That is the result of their program, as well as the reduction in that final year alone of 110,000 apprentices. It's an absolute disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about VET FEE-HELP. That has already been covered a lot in this House over the last 12 months. Incentives were provided as a big blank cheque. The Labor Party crafted this framework, and it led to dodgy providers right across the country, bringing the very sector they're talking about today into disrepute. That is why you saw TAFE become the victim of the Labor Party's actions. That is why TAFE's market share dropped from 60 per cent to 49 per cent. It was simply because of Labor's actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response, are we fixing this? Yes, we are. We are fixing this now with positive action, by promoting trades. We are fixing this now with a $1.5 billion investment, as we saw in the budget. We are fixing this now with 300,000 new apprentices over the forward estimates. That's a government that cares. That's a government taking action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  There is nothing I like more than a debate on the history of vocational education with the government. The previous speaker said, 'Let's set the record straight.' All right, let's set the record straight. What actually happened when there was a change of government in this country was that the vocational education portfolio disappeared. That's how much priority they gave it. It disappeared. Then, much to the shock of former Minister Macfarlane, he discovered it was actually in his portfolio. That's how much focus and attention they gave to vocational education. Then the minister proceeded to criticise apprentices as wasting their money on tatts and mag wheels. That's where the history of the government started on vocational education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have an abysmal five-year record on vocational education and training in this country. They never want to talk about TAFE; they never want to talk about the public provider; and they most certainly do not want to make real commitments to vocational training and apprenticeships and trainees. The minister at the table does her best in trying to rewrite history. The reality is that the VET FEE-HELP program, which the previous member referenced, blew out on their watch, time and time again. On the opposition side, the teachers unions and members of the public were screaming out warnings about what was going on. Why did that happen? That happened because, when they came to government, they specifically said to the education sector: 'We don't want any red tape. We don't want any regulation. We don't want to tie anything to requirements of performance.' And, no surprise, the market took that message and the shonks and spivs emerged and started ripping off students across this country. You only have to look at the figures on the blowout of VET FEE-HELP to see exactly when that happened and why it happened. It was because the government took their eye off the ball on vocational education and sent the message to the market: 'We don't really care. We're not going to be watching.' Unsurprisingly, what the response to that would be was the response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite want to talk about the decrease in apprenticeship numbers under Labor. I will tell you what we did. We tightened up a system where a person was signed up to a traineeship as a 16-year-old when they went to work at McDonald's. That's what was going on. Yes, we tightened that up, as we should have done. But under their watch, even under those tighter rules, we've lost 140,000 apprentices in this country. Last year in the budget, we got this big announcement about the Skilling Australians Fund. It is failing. It is structurally flawed and it is failing. What we now see in this budget, just this week, is the reality of that, which is that the government have had to knock another $270 million off the funding. Where are the figures from the government in defending this, that indicate an increase in trainees and apprentices across the country? They can't do it, because they're failing. They're not achieving it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a situation where, across the nation, people are looking for skilled workers. Just try as an individual to get carpenters or plumbers to your house; there is such a shortage across the nation. Despite all the government's talk—and I've heard it from numerous ministers, who have kept rolling through—they've not had a single win on it. They don't get up and say, 'These are the numbers; this is the increase we've had, and this is where we've made a difference,' because they can't. All they want to do is attack us, as always—we see that in question time, time and time again. How about defending your own policy? How about providing the evidence that it's working? You can't do it, because it's not. And that is not changing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our public TAFE system is reeling in regional and rural Australia. Every member of the National Party—and, indeed, the country Libs—should be going to this government and saying, 'You have to do something about TAFE. It is the backbone of our regional communities. Our people rely on it. And it is dying on the vine. You should be in this space.' But they don't; they're silent on it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget, either, the growth areas of the future—childcare; disability care; aged care—looking for skilled workers. Where are they trained? At TAFE. So even the emerging, developing opportunities for employment are not being provided with the skilled workers that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Give me a debate in this place any time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put this up, 100 per cent backed by the Leader of the Opposition, because they get TAFE and they get apprentices. And we are going to get acting on it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245550" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FLINT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak on this matter today because the Turnbull government is doing a wonderful job when it comes to vocational education and training, and I am delighted that the minister responsible, the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, is here in the chamber. She is doing a wonderful job in this space. We are inspiring so many young Australians to take up a trade and go through skills based education and training. It's really exciting stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, first of all, I just want to reflect on the fact that, when we have a strong economy, we can support as many young people as possible to get into university or to get a trade based skill, to do an apprenticeship, because we can afford to support them—and, of course, we can get them a job at the end of their education. So, as we've heard over the past few days, we are cutting personal income tax and we are cutting business taxes because we want Australians to spend their money as they choose to spend it. We want that money in their pockets. Unlike the Labor Party, who want to take money out of people's pockets, we want to keep it in their pockets so that they can make decisions for themselves. We're guaranteeing essential services, we're keeping our nation safe and secure and we are making sure the government is living within its means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we have come into government, we've created around a million jobs. That is a huge achievement. We're supporting a variety of different pathways to employment, whether it is through university, where we've increased funding, or through vocational education and training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important that we recognise that not everyone wants to, needs to or should go to university. There has been far too much emphasis on young people in particular needing to go to uni. There are so many fantastic careers and employment pathways available to young people that do not involve needing to go to university. So, when I'm out and about in my electorate, speaking to school students at my 54 schools, I encourage them to think about doing a trade by going to TAFE, to think about acquiring skills through vocational education and training. And we have one of the best systems in the world, so why wouldn't they? The minister knows this. She's doing a fantastic job on a range of different programs and promoting the opportunities to young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are about 4.2 million students involved in VET, gaining the skills that they need to get a good job or upskilling within their current employment. So that's nearly one in four Australians aged between 15 and 69. We are committed to supporting a VET system that provides the skilled workforce that our industries need to ensure Australia's continued economic growth. This is why we're investing in a new $1.5 billion Skilling Australians Fund. This replaces the scheme that Labor introduced in 2012, which was their five-year national partnerships agreement, under which apprenticeship and trainee numbers collapsed. We, under our agreements with the states, will see an extra 300,000 apprenticeships, traineeships, pre-apprenticeships and higher apprenticeships provided over the next four years. So, Minister, congratulations on the incredible work that you've done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have axed Labor's failed VET FEE-HELP scheme, and we've replaced it with VET student loans, because we should be helping students and young people in particular who want to do vocational education and training with some money to get them through their studies. We've also introduced greater protections for students who are doing a course. I'm particularly excited about the Real Skills for Real Careers strategy, which tells fantastic stories about people who have pursued a trade or skills-based training and education. There are incredible careers that people can pursue, whether plumbing, hairdressing or whatever you might choose to do. There are great opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really hope, and I will be doing my very best to make sure, that those opposite never get back into office, because when they were in office they absolutely destroyed vocational education and training. In their last year in office, from June 2012 to 2013, when the Leader of the Opposition was employment minister, apprentice numbers collapsed by 110,000, or 22 per cent. This was the largest single annual decline on record. That is a disgrace. They gave us the VET FEE-HELP scheme that saw a lot of rorting and dodgy operators and damaged the sector. I'm delighted to speak on this, as to why the coalition government is doing such a great job in this area.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I think this is called the matter of public importance. It's a chance to talk about something that's important for Australia. I don't think it's called 'let's read out the coalition's speaking points'. We are supposed to talk about the future of Australia. Four speakers have had a chance to rebut what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put forward: the proposition that in the government's budget papers you've stripped $270 million from TAFE on top of the more than $1 billion that you had cut previously. We have not had a single debating speaker come back and refute that point. I see that the member for Brisbane is up next, so this is a great chance for him. He's not a member of Team Queensland; he wasn't listed as being a member of Team Queensland by the infrastructure minister. Maybe he will be the TAFE champion—he will get up and actually talk to us about how Brisbane is benefiting from that budget last night, which ripped $200-plus million out of TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not a tradie myself, but I do have two siblings that are butchers and one sibling that's an electrician. I've got a few nephews that are plumbers, carpenters and construction workers. I understand what tradies do. They're some of our unsung heroes in society, and not only when your water or electricity are cut off and they come on the weekend to help you out; we need our tradies to keep our economy growing, whether it be things like helping us out with the NBN—that disaster that's being rolled out by those opposite—swinging the hammers, laying the pipes or literally building the foundations of our nation's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Moreton we have a world-class training centre at Acacia Ridge called SkillsTech. It's a fantastic place. The member for Cunningham has been there with me, and I've been there with the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who was most excited to meet one of the plumbing trainers because the member for Sydney's dad was a plumber and so they were able to talk plumbing stories. They are training the future tradies and technicians, not just in a classroom but obviously with the facilities that come with creating all those jobs, like motor mechanics, sheetmetal workers, fitters, panelbeaters, vehicle painters, carpenters, joiners, plumbers, cabinet-makers, electricians, and air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics, to name but a few. You can't just train those people in a classroom; you actually have to invest in infrastructure. All of those specific trades that I mentioned are on the 2017 Queensland list of skill shortages, the list put out by the Commonwealth Department of Jobs and Small Business. All of those skills are actually taught at TAFEs like SkillsTech at Acacia Ridge, yet what do we see? We see a myopic, stumbling government that is cutting funds to the training facilities that are necessary to skill our workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Cunningham touched on, the other big cut and the other great need is aged care. The number of senior baby boomers is booming. We know that that population pyramid is going to work its way through. It is a sector for which the workforce will need to at least double by 2050—double its workforce! So, what are we doing? Are we investing in aged care training? No, we're making cuts to training facilities, when we need to provide extra training for workers in the aged-care sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, obviously, would be a much more practical and visionary government under Prime Minister Shorten. I will tell you what we would be doing. We would be doing things like guaranteeing that at least two out of every three Commonwealth dollars goes to TAFE, because we know that TAFE in the bush and in the city is the backbone of training. We know that TAFE will do the right thing. We'll provide 10,000 pre-apprenticeship programs for young people who want to learn a trade and provide 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who need to retrain. We will invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country because, sadly, some of them that were built in the seventies—and some that were even built in the late sixties—are starting to look a little bit old and tired. More importantly, we will ensure that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices and Australian trainees. We will make sure that the job needs of the future are being invested in by the Commonwealth government. We know that TAFE has the track record. It's not going to jump in like the spivs did under the watch of those opposite. We know that as they enter their fifth year of government they need to step up on investing in TAFE.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="61378" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr EVANS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I was so pleased that the member of Moreton asked me whether I am a member of 'team Queensland' and whether Brisbane is sharing in this infrastructure pipeline promised in the budget by this government. I was delighted on Tuesday night when the Treasurer announced $300 million towards the Brisbane Metro, to make that project a reality for the people of Brisbane. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the very good people of Brisbane, all of those locals who answered my calls and signed the petitions, who helped to prove how enthusiastic the grassroots support was in Brisbane for the Brisbane Metro project. People of Brisbane, your voice has been heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I almost laughed out loud when I heard that in today's debate Labor was going to try to raise education and skills funding. Labor's silly line about somehow making it harder for people to get a job has come straight after the biggest ever year for job creation in Australia's history—on average, 1,100 jobs created each and every day last year. The vast majority of those jobs were full-time jobs and the vast majority went to women. Women currently have the highest participation rate in the workforce that they've ever had in Australia's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor should be embarrassed to bring up the topic of education funding. Right now, education funding is higher than it ever was under any year that Labor was ever in office, and the funding is going up, not down. I can report that Brisbane's education sector is going from strength to strength. In fact, international education is currently Brisbane city's biggest export. One of the reasons is that Australia's vocational education and training system is internationally recognised as one of the very best in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a reason that Labor in particular should be so embarrassed to bring up their record on the funding of skills and apprenticeships when they were in government. For those playing along at home—everyone can look this up for themselves as I talk about it—you just have to Google 'NCVER apprenticeship numbers'. NCVER is the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. They publish these numbers and have done so for years—they graph them. If you do a Google image search on their numbers it will come up straight away on the front page and it will become abundantly clear within seconds to anyone who does so that apprenticeship numbers went off a cliff in 2012 when Labor were in charge, when they totally and fatally lost control of the government's budget and the nation's finances. They lost control of Australia's budget; they dropped apprenticeship funding; and the number of apprenticeships in our country went off a cliff. That is what happened. I was there. I was working with industry and with trainers in the retail sector at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, for Labor to bring up this topic in this way shows that they have absolutely no shame, and to bring it up in a week when the entire national conversation is about the federal budget and about how this country is trying to turn the corner after those horrible years when Labor did lose control of the budget, and all of the terrible consequences that had for education and training and every other area, shows that they have absolutely no idea. Labor have no shame and no idea. Rather than cuts, education funding is going up in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week's budget has been, I must say, a fantastic budget for the people of Brisbane. More than 75,000 people across the electorate of Brisbane will receive tax cuts in 50 days. Those hardworking people right across Brisbane will be keeping more of their own money, their own hard-earned money, as reward for their efforts, because this government's strong economic plan is starting to pay dividends for the country, just as it is in jobs and just as it is in the education and training spaces. A year ago, when I got up in this House to talk about last year's budget, I predicted why supporting Australia's small and medium businesses would pay these sorts of dividends, and now here we are seeing evidence of the key planks of the government's strong economic plan: tax relief for small and medium businesses, our innovation agenda, our education and training funding, the new free trade agreements and growing our defence industry. We see evidence of these policies working right across Brisbane and right across the country. Nationwide, these policies have combined to help Australia's small and medium businesses create new jobs, more jobs, faster than at any time in Australia's history.</span>

                    </a>  In terms of schedule 1, regarding toughening the multinational anti-avoidance law, the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that the multinational anti-avoidance law applies appropriately to artificial and contrived arrangements involving trusts and partnerships entered into by multinational entities to avoid the taxation of business profits in Australia. We note that the schedule implements a technical integrity measure underpinning the multinational anti-avoidance law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government has regularly made much of statements that Labor voted against the multinational anti-avoidance law, but this is simply not true. In this House, Labor supported that bill and, in the Senate, Labor voted against a government-Greens amendment. Yes, that's right: the government teamed up with the Greens to water down the tax transparency law and reporting requirements for large companies. The effect of that amendment—which was ultimately successful through the Greens and the coalition government—was to reduce the number of Australian companies who were required to report their tax arrangements each year. Some of those big companies were raking in revenue close to $16 billion but were paying no tax. The government wanted to reduce the number of those companies that were required to report every year, and guess what? The Greens teamed up with them and allowed that to occur. Labor ultimately facilitated the passage of the multinational anti-avoidance law in both houses, but we did that over protestations about reducing the exposure and the scrutiny that was allowed by that law by reducing the number of companies subject to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the Turnbull government have been a light touch and have had a hands-off approach when it comes to big business and those at the top end of town, and we've seen this over the past couple of years with their approach to the banking industry. The fact is that for 600 days they avoided and actively opposed a royal commission into the banking sector in Australia. Labor's been proven right, once again, in the evidence that's come out of that inquiry—there was systemic and substantial rorting by this industry, undermining Australians' finances, and it needed to be looked at, and that's what's occurring at the moment. We welcome the fact that the commissioner's doing a fantastic job, and we await the outcomes of his interim report in September and ultimately a final report in February next year. This is a reflection of this government's ideological emphasis: checks and balances on government power but no consideration given to the checks and balances on the power of big businesses and the wealthy to avoid their community obligations, particularly when it comes to paying their fair share of tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the Turnbull government, from the top down, including the extreme free-market fringe, are more concerned with so-called red tape and the banks' cost of doing business than with appropriately regulating them. They see tax and the collection of tax revenue as the biggest cost of doing business. They call it a tax grab. But we know, of course, that one in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax for at least the past three years. That's no taxation revenue that could have been used for funding important social resources like health, education and infrastructure. Over a series of decades what we've seen is a number of these corporations being very adept at using accounting practices to make loans to subsidiaries in other countries, to transfer funds to subsidiaries in other countries where there is a lower corporate tax rate, and to avoid paying their fair share of tax in Australia. It was only when Labor began to highlight this—and, indeed, when these practices were highlighted through international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the OECD—that we began to get action from this government. This is despite tax transparency laws that show just how much the people of Australia are losing through this light-touch approach to collecting their fair share of taxation. Yet the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have still given priority to big business over reining in some of that taxation revenue to ensure we have a fairer budget balance from the corporate sector. We all know that, in the budget that was released just a couple of days ago, there remains the $80 billion tax cut for the biggest businesses in this country. Don't worry about actually getting what's owed to the Australian people. This government, as part of the trickle-down economics philosophy, is more intent on providing a tax cut to the big end of town. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the past week some very interesting research has been released in the United States about the effect of the first round of corporate tax cuts in America, and—surprise, surprise!—what that research has uncovered is where that first round of corporate tax cuts went. Guess where the benefits of those corporate tax cuts went? Well, they didn't go into the pay packets of the workers of those corporations, I can tell you that; they went into profits and to the shareholders through increased dividends. It's clear, based on studies like that and a litany of others throughout the world, that this trickle-down approach to economics of cutting taxes for corporations in the wish and the hope that they will pass them on to their workers and employ more people is complete rubbish. It doesn't happen. These studies that have been released in the United States prove that. Cutting penalty rates for workers who work on weekends in the hospitality industry only makes things worse. These are the reasons why people's real incomes have not been increasing in Australia over the last decade, why families are feeling the pinch and why workers are feeling the pinch and feeling left behind by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of these matters involve deliberate tax evasion, often through the use of overseas tax havens or complex corporate structures to avoid detection and recovery. Tax havens have been estimated to hold $7.5 trillion of the world's financial wealth, costing the global economy $200 billion in lost taxes every year. The strategy of choice used by those deliberately evading their fair share of tax is a clear and present threat to Australia's taxation base. When tax revenue gets lost to tax havens, Australians ultimately have to pay higher taxes or suffer cuts to those vital services and shared social resources that I referred to earlier, particularly health, education and infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, Labor announced a comprehensive tax haven transparency package. The policy includes tax domicile disclosure for government procurement tenders, whistleblower protections and even rewards for reporting of tax haven exposure to shareholders, and public reporting of just how much tax is paid in jurisdictions where these firms operate. Yet this light-touch, hands-off government has been backtracking on a beneficial ownership registry—another Labor policy that we announced in 2017. This registry would help identify the ultimate owners that sit behind some of these shell companies. It's about improving the transparency that is there with regard to the operation of these companies and, ultimately, being able to hold someone accountable when they do use these tricky taxation and accounting measures to transfer profits overseas to avoid paying tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government also commissioned an unrelated secret Board of Taxation review on the 2016-17 budget measures and the OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of taxation information. Of course, we only know that because of Senate estimates. The report was released only days ago because Senators Ketter and McAllister were able to get that via the Senate estimates process. The government didn't even want to release this report and what was actually going on in terms of some of the taxation transparency measures in the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that the Treasurer doesn't want to close a lot of these loopholes. Of course, we heard absolutely nothing from him about cracking down on tax havens in this budget. We know that the introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor, could help stem the flow of missing money that should be flowing to the Australian people. Corporate profits are soaring and, while Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack in terms of competitiveness and the actual rate of taxation for corporations, the only policy that this government has had in this area is to cut corporate taxes and to give those companies a big advantage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows what needs to be done—and, if we're elected, we're willing to do it—to crack down on multinational tax avoidance. We have announced a plan to close those loopholes and attack the deliberate use of tax havens, first, by tightening debt deduction loopholes used by multinational companies to improve their budget by billions over the medium term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second element of our plan is introducing the public reporting of country-by-country reports. We need to see the high-level tax information about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third is providing protection for whistleblowers who report on those entities evading tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Where a whistleblower's information results in more tax being paid, we should allow them to collect a share of the tax penalty with a reward of up to $250,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth is introducing a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. This approach will allow the public to find out just who really owns companies and who is behind these corporate and accounting practices of setting up different shell companies to avoid the scrutiny of the public. It's clear that shareholders shouldn't be able to use complex structures and sham ownership arrangements to avoid complying with corporate transparency rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifth is introducing mandatory shareholder reporting of tax haven exposure. Companies must disclose to their shareholders, as a material tax risk, if the company is doing business in some of these tax havens. Unfortunately, that is not occurring at the moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixth is appointing a community sector representative to boards of taxation to ensure the community sector's voice is heard in tax design and review processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventh is introducing public reporting of Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, or AUSTRAC, data and requiring the annual public release of international cash flow data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighth is requiring government tenders to disclose their country of tax domicile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninth is developing guidelines for investment by superannuation funds. This should be done by the Australian Taxation Office in collaboration with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final element of our plan requires the Australian tax office's annual report to provide information on the number and size of tax settlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some comments in respect of schedule 2 of the bill, which goes to improving the integrity of small-business capital gains tax concessions. These changes include additional conditions that must be satisfied to apply the small-business CGT concessions to capital gains. The amendments implement the measure announced in the 2017-18 budget as 'Tax integrity package—improving small business capital gains tax concessions' and apply to CGT events that occur on or after 1 July 2017.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we note that the original 2017-18 budget proposal is vague in its details. Many tax professionals and stakeholders have said that it would not be until the release of the exposure draft legislation that those affected would become aware of just how they were going to be affected by this legislation. These stakeholders make the reasonable claim that, due to a lack of detail, taxpayers who have conducted their tax affairs in good faith could be caught by changes that go beyond what was flagged in the previous budget. They argue that, to help prevent adverse consequences for taxpayers who have been acting in good faith but couldn't reasonably be expected to foresee the detailed amendments finally unveiled in the exposure draft, the implementation date should be changed from 1 July 2017, as per the original budget announcement, to 8 February 2018. That's the exposure draft release date. In light of those stakeholder concerns, Labor supports the start date being 8 February 2018, as proposed by the tax professionals community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of schedule 3, which goes to fin-tech and venture capital amendments, these amendments in income tax law and the Venture Capital Act ensure that venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fin-tech businesses. This schedule partially implements a 2016-17 budget measure, the National Innovation and Science Agenda, as it expands the new arrangements for venture capital limited partnerships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor notes that the main observation following consultation with key stakeholders was the timing of the concessions proposed in this measure. They still leave some uncertainty about the long-term eligibility for concessions in the commercialisation process. This has led to some uncertainty about whether investment decisions will actually be improved. Labor, again, has requested that the minister instigate a look at the impact of investment on the venture capital concession provisions overall, including the measures in this bill, to ensure that they are operating as intended. To provide an added layer of certainty, the amendments should allow Innovation and Science Australia to make public and private findings on assessments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, once again, Labor support the tax integrity measures in this bill, but we are somewhat sceptical about and somewhat dismayed by this government's light-handed approach when it comes to tackling tax avoidance in Australia. This particular coalition government has been very sloppy in its approach to key stakeholders on important tax matters—namely, those that go to the notions of transparency and accountability by corporations when it comes to taxation, how much they're paying and where they're paying it. Labor have laid out a clear plan of improved measures that would bring greater transparency and accountability to this industry. We commend that approach to the government and we hope that it sincerely looks at adopting some of those amendments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. As I am Chair of the House Committee on Tax and Revenue, this bill is close to my heart. Yes, there is a beating heart at the core of all good tax legislation. This bill fulfils the Turnbull government's commitment to ensure Australians can have confidence in a fair and equitable tax system whereby everyone plays by the same set of rules and pays their fair share of tax. This government, more than any other government in the past, has legislated tough laws to crack down on tax avoidance across the entire tax system and across all sectors of the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes a number of key changes across four schedules that all work to make our tax system fairer, more cost-effective and efficient and to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules. Firstly, schedule 1, better known as MAAL, makes technical amendments to ensure that the government's multinational tax avoidance law operates as intended. As a result of this amendment, multinationals will no longer be able to use corporate structures with foreign trusts and partnerships to avoid the application of the MAAL. These changes were announced in last year's budget as part of the government's commitment to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The OECD has estimated that, globally, between US$100 billion and US$240 billion of corporate tax revenue is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies developed by tax lawyers in new tax jurisdictions, like Liechtenstein and the Bahamas. As part of the global effort to combat multinational tax avoidance, the OECD G20 base erosion and profit-shifting project has delivered a number of recommendations to strengthen countries' tax integrity rules and ensure that the international tax system works as intended. Since 2015, Australia has implemented a range of such actions. The government has also taken additional action on multinational tax avoidance beyond the OECD recommendations, including implementing the multinational anti-avoidance law and the diverted profits tax, both of which discourage large multinationals from artificially diverting profits offshore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The MAAL, which took effect from 1 January 2016, prevents multinationals from escaping Australian tax by using artificial or contrived arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence in Australia. The ATO has observed a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government. The ATO estimates that more than $7 billion in sales revenue annually is already being added to the Australian tax base as a result of the government's MAAL. Already we have seen 38 multinational entities changing, or they are in the process of changing, their tax affairs to bring their Australian sourced sales back onshore in compliance with the MAAL, including Google and Facebook. This is also competitively neutral, putting foreign multinationals on the same level as Australian owned and run businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, schedule 2 of the bill improves the integrity of the small business capital gains tax concessions, in line with the measures announced in the 2017-18 budget to improve integrity and ensure that small business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted. Currently, some taxpayers are able to access the small business CGT concessions for assets that are unrelated to their small businesses. The proposed amendment applies to CGT events that occur on or after 1 July 2017. This application is consistent with the 2017-18 budget announcements to ensure that small business CGT concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business—for instance, by arranging their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the test for determining eligibility of the concessions. The proposed amendments are needed to improve the integrity of the concessions and ensure that they are appropriately targeted for the benefit of genuine small businesses. The small business CGT concessions provide taxpayers with full or partial relief from taxation on capital gains on the disposal of assets related to their business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four existing small business CGT concessions. The first is retirement exemption—lifetime limit exempting $500,000 of capital gains from disposing of active assets on retirement. If the taxpayer is under 55 years of age, money from the disposal of the asset must be paid into a complying superannuation fund or a retirement savings account. There is a 50 per cent active asset reduction—a 50 per cent reduction in the capital gains made from the disposal of an asset used in a business. There is a 15-year exemption—a 100 per cent exemption for active assets owned for at least 15 years where the taxpayer is over the age of 55 and is retiring or permanently incapacitated. And there is the rollover deferral of all or part of a capital gain for two years or longer if the taxpayer requires a replacement asset or incurs expenditure on making capital improvements to an existing asset. These concessions help small businesses grow and reinvest their profits as well as contribute to their retirement savings through the sale of their business. This is about ensuring that these concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small business owners. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendment will mean that small business CGT concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in small business, or ownership interests in a small business. As a result of the consultation process, amendments to the exposure draft were made to streamline the operation of the integrity rules surrounding the use of cash and financial instruments as part of the business. The requirement for cash and financial instruments to be inherently connected with the business will continue to apply. An additional integrity rule is also being introduced to ensure that there is no incentive for taxpayers to enter into artificial arrangements for the purpose of meeting this test. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the purpose of testing the size of an enterprise or company or trust being disposed of, an entity is treated as controlling another entity if its interest in that entity is 20 per cent or more. This means that more entities will be considered to be connected with each other and will need to include their assets or turnover for the purpose of this test. The lowering of this threshold to 20 per cent is a necessary tightening to ensure the concessions can only be accessed in relation to genuine small businesses. Importantly, these tests apply on an entity-by-entity basis. The taxpayer at the top of a chain of companies or trusts may not qualify for the concession in respect of shares or interest it holds—for example, because that chain includes an indirect interest in a large business. However, another taxpayer in the same chain of companies or trusts may qualify for the concessions in respect of shares or interest it holds in a small business. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take a tradesman in my electorate as an example—say, John the plumber. He started his plumbing business at the age of 25 after receiving all of his qualifications, building his business over 30 years to be a modestly successful entity, employing apprentices and becoming a local household name—in the area, of course. John, now in his mid-50s, can no longer do the arduous work he previously did over the past 30 years. John decides to sell his business and retire. This is what the Liberal Party has given John, a person who has risked going out on his own to start a business, has put his home on the line, has put his hand in his own pocket, has employed apprentices and has contributed to our community and the wider economy: he can now retire without having to pay capital gains tax, rebalancing the risk-for-reward equation. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government is committed to supporting small businesses through tax relief and initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which was extended for a further 12 months in Tuesday night's budget as outlined by the Treasurer. These small business CGT concessions assist owners of small businesses by providing relief from CGT on the disposal of assets related to their business, helping them to reinvest and grow, as well as contributing to their retirement savings through the sale of the business—but, above all, by encouraging entrepreneurship. The concessions themselves are not changing and will continue to be available to genuine small businesses and taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets of less than $6 million. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key features of the new law include: limiting the size of the company or trust being disposed of, to ensure that it is a genuine small business; clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interests in the company or trust, to ensure that taxpayers do not benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote; and modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares in companies and interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities, which will prevent the concessions from being available where most of the value of the company or trust is unrelated to the small business activities.</span>

Unlike compensation, a reparation payment represents an acknowledgement by Defence that the abuse suffered by the complainant was wrong, that it can have a lasting and serious impact and also that in the past Defence was not positioned appropriately to respond to abuse in many cases. The recipient of a reparation payment should receive the full benefit of that payment and, as such, the payment should be exempt from income tax.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  This Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, which deals with tax integrity and the euphemistic 'other measures', actually covers the great areas of tax havens and multinational tax. When I talk to members of my community, the taxation issue that they raise with me most after WA's distribution of the GST is the lack of a crackdown on multinationals who don't pay their tax. That is the No. 2 taxation issue that members of my community raise with me on a regular basis. I think that's a very useful point to make. It's a useful point to make because it points to the priorities of ordinary Australians. The reason they raise the need for us to ensure that multinational corporations pay tax and don't offshore tax or minimise tax is that they understand that, in order to ensure their access to the essential services they need from government, we need to be able to properly fund our education system, our health system, defence and everything else that the Commonwealth government does—as well as not giving away masses of money to the big banks—and part of that is making sure that there's some integrity to our tax system so that the money that should be paid in taxation is actually paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax havens threaten Australia's tax base. When our tax revenue gets lost to tax havens, Australians ultimately have to pay higher taxes or, as many constituents in the electorate of Burt realise, suffer cuts to vital services. For example, the Cayman Islands has been criticised by the OECD and by the tax commissioner for its excessive secrecy. There are more companies in the Cayman Islands than people. A single building in the Caymans, Ugland House, is apparently home to over 18,000 companies. The tax commissioner has said in a speech to The Tax Institute:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of these matters involve deliberate tax evasion, often using overseas tax havens or complex corporate structures to avoid detection and recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shock waves from the Panama Papers and similar scandals involving corporations and high-net-worth individuals aggressively minimising their tax are felt around the world. Other governments have been jolted into action on transparency measures since the public outcry over the Panama Papers. The Turnbull government, however—wait for it—has done virtually nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With rising inequality and rising government debt, the time for acting on tax havens has not only come; it's almost gone. We need to get started on this. We need to make sure there's real action. Tax havens have been estimated to hold $7.5 trillion of the world's financial wealth, costing the global economy $200 billion in lost taxes every year. Labor announced, back in 2017, a comprehensive tax haven transparency package, including tax domicile disclosure for government procurement tenders; whistleblower protections and rewards; reporting of tax haven exposure to shareholders; and public reporting of how much tax is paid in jurisdictions that a firm operates in, along with related materials. Meanwhile, what has the government been doing? It has been backtracking on a beneficial ownership register and has commissioned an unreleased, secret Board of Taxation review into the 2016-17 budget measure on OECD proposals for mandatory disclosure of tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has it backtracked on these measures? One in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax in at least the last three years, but the priority of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is still to give over $80 billion in tax cuts to big business. We know that Australia is missing out on billions in tax revenue thanks to the loopholes that continue to exist in our taxation system and which the Turnbull government refuses to properly close, despite Labor saying that we will cooperate with them in this area. The introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor, could help stem the flow of this missing money. But the Treasurer doesn't want to close those loopholes. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy this government seems to have is a big company tax cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a different plan, and I've outlined some of the parts of Labor's plan. The point here is that, unlike the many criticisms that we, on all sides, receive in politics that government and opposition can't work together, this is an area of law where we could be working together better to create better law to make sure we have more integrity in our tax system, instead of doing what the government is doing: continuing to bring forward piecemeal pieces of legislation so that it can say it's working on tax integrity and on closing down multinational tax loopholes—which it does frequently say—while in actual fact leaving loopholes open and not doing the full work, even some of the work it said it would do, to close these loopholes. These are the things that need to happen, but the government refuses to do them, which is really quite disappointing. As I said, this is the second biggest tax issue that people in my community raise with me. They know that if we don't get this fixed it results in cuts to their services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other parts of what I referred to as the euphemistic use of 'other measures' in this bill. We see the improvement of tax integrity not only by looking at tax havens and other areas of multinational taxation but by looking at improving the integrity of the small-business CGT concessions. There are some amendments Labor thinks should be made in this area. One of the things that stuck out for me when I looked at this part of the bill was that, despite the fact that it was only on Tuesday—only two days ago—that the government handed down their 2018-19 budget, this is a measure from the 2017-18 budget. The government are really running the parliament well; we're still getting around to trying to deal with issues from the last budget measures, and they've just handed down the latest budget. Maybe we need to include other categories in the forward estimates: one saying, 'This is what we think we're going to do in the next financial year,' and another saying, 'These are the things we might get around to doing, but we don't really know if we'll include it, and hopefully we'll be able to work it through parliament.' These are the areas we actually want to agree with them on. These are areas we want to help them on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It brings to mind other areas of legislation that are in this space—things like working with the fin-tech sector, which is the other part of schedule 3. Again, this is a measure that is from the last budget that we are only just now getting around to dealing with in the chamber of the House of Representatives.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you. I refer to the member for Chifley's very eloquent point—this is from two budgets ago. I wasn't even in the parliament when they budgeted for this. I've had to come into the parliament—the people of Burt had to elect me—so we could get on with this. I thank the people of Burt for doing that. Imagine how far behind we'd be otherwise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bit like the NBN under this government. It almost goes backwards. It is amazing we have a fin-tech sector in this country, given the way the government goes around legislating for it. It's a bit like a sandbox it tried to create—despite the fact that we highlighted some of the issues that it would have with it—and realised that it doesn't actually work and now it has got to fix it again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a bit like when we tried to create a better way for start-ups to raise capital online. That is another piece of legislation they put into parliament about which we said: 'This is great and we're happy to move on this. By the way, there are a few things you'd better fix up because we think it's probably not going to work the way you think it's going to work.' Then, 12 months later, they said: 'You're right about that. We'd better fix it up; we'll bring in legislation'. We are nearly 12 months past that point, and they haven't even gotten it through the parliament yet—in fact, they haven't even brought it on for debate in the Senate yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This really comes back to the point on the concerns we have about this piece of legislation. This is good legislation in theory, but there are things in schedules 3 and 4 in particular that we say need to be improved or fixed up. We are a party that wants to work with the government on making sure that our tax laws have integrity, that we capture multinational tax loss and that we provide an effective system of taxation and an effective regulatory environment for our fin-tech sector and start-up sector. We want to make sure we get it right. I don't want to find myself back here in six months time debating more legislation to fix this legislation, when it's taken two years to get around debating it in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst overall we support this legislation and the intent of the legislation, as I said before, what it really highlights is that what we really need is Labor's plan to deal with multinational taxation to make sure we actually fix the issue of companies and high-net-wealth individuals being able to offshore their profits and their high incomes to avoid paying tax in Australia, which is where it's needed, so we can provide the services that ordinary Australians rely on. The Liberal government, when it comes to this area, are all light and mirrors. They make it look like they are doing something, and they say they are doing something, but in reality it's a half-baked approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a bit like their half-baked approach of looking at the financial sector and the big banks in this country. On one hand, they say, 'We're going to give you a big tax cut.' On the other hand, they say to the public—kicking and screaming, I might point out—'We'll hold a royal commission.' Then they look at some of the things that come out of that royal commission and say: 'Look at that bad behaviour! We'll throw the book at them. We'll make sure they get tough penalties. We'll make sure any criminal behaviour gets investigated and looked into.' Then, lo and behold, they hand down a budget, and when we go through the detail to see what's happening with ASIC, $20 million or $30 million is disappearing from ASIC, the agency that would be investigating and enforcing against the banks and our financial sector. Nearly $2 million was ripped out of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the agency that would be prosecuting them. What we see is a continuation of the protection rackets for the big banks and the financial sector in Australia. Here it is again. It's almost a protection racket. The government will say, 'We are fixing up multinational taxation,' but at the end of the day it's all smoke and mirrors.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I think you'd be aware, Deputy Speaker Goodenough, as many others would: in this place, you can't even scratch yourself without running into a 'parliamentary friends of' group. These groups are doing some really good work, but there are a lot of them that seem to pop up with a great degree of frequency. I have a recommendation for the coalition: given how much they talk about this sector, particularly the fin-tech sector, and their inability to get anything done, I think they need to create the 'faux friends of fin-tech'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition talk a lot about how close they are to the fin-tech community. They talk about all this legislation that they're putting forward. They're always there with the media release. They're always there with the announcement. They're always there to try to claim some credit and show that they've got a fin-tech community. The Treasurer brings together the fin-tech community in his little consultative group and says, 'We're going to be putting these things forward.' Then, when you match the words against reality, you find a massive gulf. This is definitely the case with elements in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will restrict my comments to the venture capital component, but I think that it is telling, particularly with this section, which should be relatively straightforward—but then you realise the enormous gestation period, the time it took to get to this point, which reflects that, while the coalition talk a big game on fin-tech, they don't deliver. This schedule would give the appearance of being fairly straightforward when someone reads the explanatory memorandum and understands what's going on. It allows for early stage venture capital limited partnerships and VCLP arrangements to change the way in which they can, where they've been prohibited before, back investments in the banking, finance and insurance areas—all straightforward. But what I have been finding out when talking with stakeholders about this is how long it took to get to this point—how long it took for this straightforward move to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">FinTech Australia—and I went and checked this out—put out a policy paper on this very issue in February 2016. The government, in its 2016-17 budget—May of 2016—said: 'Yes, we're going to do this. We'll move ahead on this.' And it was not until October 2017 that the government, through Treasury, started to consult on amendments to allow this to happen. So from February and May 2016 we get to October 2017. Again, they make the big announcements, claim the credit and, when the hard work needs to be done, are nowhere to be seen—they drag it out. The sector and people in the sector have raised with me that they're not entirely happy with what's been put forward in this bill. Again, it's a straightforward measure, but they still don't think that it's picked up their concerns. For example—and I had highlighted to me—in 3.26 of the explanatory memorandum it states that a fin-tech may be eligible for the tax concession when developing its technology. However—and this is what has been raised with me—it then goes on to say that when a business is commercialising the technology it would no longer be eligible. As has been raised with me: 'This hardly seems like a certain, longer term platform for a venture capital firm to make an investment in a fin-tech, given that the VC is only making the investment because it's hoping the fin-tech will be able to commercialise and profit from the technology.' This is what they're raising with me, and I'm sure they have raised it with Treasury.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's another bit of legislation after some of the other stuff that was being done in this space to reform the VCLP and ESVCLP arrangements that we've already—we haven't even debated the regulatory sandbox and the other measures that were contained in there as it pertains to venture capital. The government hasn't even bothered to bring that debate in here. We're still having those concerns, and that they're not being taken seriously, raised with us. We are going to be moving an amendment that this be reviewed so that we can see if it's actually successful, because here are some firms that simply, in the banking, finance and insurance space, if they develop their product, can provide a competitive alternative to existing arrangements. The banks are so fearful of things like opening up banking data not because of a new-found commitment to protecting certain consumers or a new-found love of privacy after some of the breaches we've seen in the last few weeks. What they're really scared witless of is the fact that the fin-tech community, particularly in Australia, will offer a very strong and competitive alternative to what people have had to cop from the banks and financial services sector in times past. We should be encouraging them. We back the government's commitment, but what we really back is concrete reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we have this legislation that we've already picked up stakeholder reticence about because it doesn't necessarily pick up all their concerns. They are concerned, for example, about going through with Innovation and Science Australia and expecting some of the rulings, even though admittedly this legislation is supposed to provide a bit more certainty through the public and private ruling mechanism. But there are people concerned that they can't get the green light from ISA to go ahead and then get the investment that's required. They are obviously going to be concerned in the longer term, when the broadening of the definition plays out, about how long it might take to see things happen there. So there are concerns with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not even debating the regulatory sandbox changes that need to happen. Again, the government said that this is really important, and it is important because they stuffed the first version. They had only four fin-techs go through their regulatory sandbox—less than half a dozen—and they need to fix that up now with a series of changes that still haven't been put to the parliament. The other thing that is just staggering for a government that says it is pro fin-tech—as I said, faux friends of fin-tech—how come they haven't had the wherewithal to bring in the final lot of changes through the Senate on equity crowdfunding?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, when they rammed through this place the changes that we said would be overly bureaucratic, would not deliver the benefits they said would happen, and would not allow smaller firms to access the level of capital raising required to help those firms grow, they still put them through. At the time, I labelled it 'ScoMo's dodo', because we knew it was heading for one thing and one thing only—extinction—because it had to have a whole new set of changes put to it. That's what they did in September. They brought another round of legislation in to fix up the fatally flawed legislation that they had in March. They introduced it in this place in September last year and then it didn't go in through the Senate at the end of the year. We then waited for February for it to come in, and they didn't debate it then. Then we got to March and it still didn't get debated, and then we had the long break before the budget. Now it's come in, in the first week in May, and they haven't put it through the Senate. Mind you, this is after the opposition has offered every assurance that we will work with them. We want to see the time frame for the introduction shortened. We've said to the government continually that we will work with them on this—just bring the framework in. And they couldn't get it into the Senate this week. What does that mean for the fin-tech community or others in the early-stage innovation space? You now will not see this legislation debated until three-quarters of the way through June. The government has baked in a delay of six months from royal assent before the new regime takes place, which means it would be December of this year, notionally, before it comes in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To their great credit, the government agreed with us to shorten that period of time. We wanted it even shorter. We wanted it introduced right from the start of the new financial year, but they still won't agree to it, because they're worried about ASIC, and ASIC is playing ping-pong, saying, 'It's up to the parliament to determine what happens.' They didn't even know at estimates that there was this six-month period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, again, ScoMo's dodo, now the 'go-slow by ScoMo', is going to create another dodo, because equity crowdfunding is now being overtaken by an alternative financing vehicle in the form of initial coin offerings, using cryptocurrency as a way to generate capital for early-stage innovators. So this is now just taking place on its own and it threatens to potentially outstrip what could be raised through equity crowdfunding anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bigger story in all this is that we've been debating this since May 2013. We made the reference to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee in May 2013 to set up the framework. The coalition government got the report in May 2014, but by 2018 we still don't have the actual framework in place. It has been five years—four under your coalition government, where you say that you're pro innovation, you say you're pro fin-tech sector, but you can't even get the reforms in. You drag it out so long that alternative vehicles for capital raisings emerge, which, I have to say, are less informative to investors and will require much more sophisticated investors to understand and interpret what's going on. It's been dragged out. You're either fair dinkum about encouraging fin-tech and the emergence of a stronger fin-tech sector in this country, or you're just fake friends of the sector, only wanting to be there for the click of the cameras and the writing of the stories. You're not there to actually put it through, and this is even when we're prepared to work with the coalition on this. It is a disgrace. This shouldn't happen. If you were pro business, if you were truly pro opening up alternative pathways for capital raising, you would have got it done, but you haven't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just the same as the concerns we have with what's contained within schedule 3 of this legislation. Based on what we're hearing out of the fin-tech sector and what stakeholders are raising with us, you still haven't cleared it up. If the Treasurer's too busy, he has an assistant minister. Assign him to make sure this happens. He has enough space to be able to make this happen. I'm sure he wants to cut his teeth on this legislation—he'll do the summing-up in a few minutes time. So why don't they take the steps, task up the proper people, make this happen, get the legislation through and prove that they are more than words, that they are action, as opposed to what we're seeing right now?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  In summing up the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, I will say that this further delivers on this government's agenda to address multinational tax avoidance, ensures that the small-business capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted, ensures that we have the policy settings in order to foster innovation and makes the taxation of Defence abuse repatriation payments fairer. Schedule 1 of this bill demonstrates again our ongoing commitment to tackling multinational tax avoidance by further preventing large multinationals from avoiding tax on their Australian business profits through artificially structuring their affairs, which ultimately amounts to taxable income not being captured in the Australian tax net. The amendments contained in schedule 1 ensure that the multilateral anti-tax-avoidance law, which targets these egregious practices, will continue to operate as intended and deliver on the government's commitment to improving the integrity of Australia's tax system, which ultimately benefits all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to improve the integrity of the tax system and ensure that the small-business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted. These amendments give effect to the government's 2017-18 budget announcement that, from 1 July 2017, the concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. The key feature of the amendments is to test the size of the business being disposed of, to prevent inappropriate access to the concessions for assets unrelated to a small business. This ensures that these important concessions continue to benefit those who need them most, which are hardworking small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global fin-tech hub. When I spoke at the fin-tech futures forum in Melbourne last week, the government were certainly congratulated on the work and support that we're providing fin-techs. Therefore, schedule 3 of this bill builds on our work to ensure that we have the policy settings best in place to foster this sort of innovation. Accordingly, schedule 3 amends the early stage venture capital limited partnership, venture capital limited partnership and tax incentives for early stage investor regimes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This clarifies that early stage venture capital limited partnerships and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses, removes ambiguity from the tax law, and provides certainty for venture capital investors. Again, we believe that this demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and risk taking in Australia and will help ensure innovative Australian businesses have access to the capital and, importantly, the expertise that they need to grow and succeed in this very competitive area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2017-18 budget the government announced it would expand the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to make recommendations for reparation payments. All complaints about abuse in the Defence Force made to the Defence Force Ombudsman will now include an assessment for a reparation payment. Similar reparation payments were previously administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. Reparation payments made by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were specifically exempt from income tax. Schedule 4 of this bill therefore ensures that the new reparation payments recommended by the Defence Force Ombudsman are exempt from income tax. Reparation payments are not intended to be compensation, and complainants will not be required to release the Commonwealth from any liability. Schedule 4 ensures the recipient of a reparation payment receives the full benefit of the payment and, importantly, is free from the obligation to pay income tax on it. Therefore, I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  I'm speaking tonight on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018. This bill reintroduces a controversial 2017-18 budget measure to establish a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 recipients of Newstart allowance and youth allowance (other) in three locations: Canterbury Bankstown in New South Wales, Logan in Queensland, and Mandurah in Western Australia. Here we are, a year later, debating this proposal from this government yet again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was scrutinised in a Senate inquiry that reported earlier this week. Of course, we all recall that the Turnbull government previously introduced this measure in a different bill in September last year. Labor opposed the drug-testing trials the first time they were introduced into the parliament, and we will oppose them again. The drug-testing trial measure was subsequently withdrawn from the welfare reform bill due to a lack of support in the Senate. The government continues to pursue this policy, which is completely devoid of support in the medical, health and community sectors. There is no evidence, none at all, that this approach will help anyone with a drug addiction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor spent a considerable period of time listening to expert advice from health professionals before we ultimately came to our position to oppose this trial. It is very rare that the medical and community sectors speak in unison on an issue, but they have spoken out strongly against this drug-testing trial. There is a clear consensus that this trial will not work. It is not based on evidence and, in fact, this trial could make the situation worse for some very vulnerable people. We have listened to the experts; plainly, the government has not. We know the government didn't even consult its own drug and alcohol advisory group, because, of course, they didn't want to be told that it wouldn't work and that it was a waste of money. In fact, when asked, the government can't name one expert who thinks that this trial will work. It can't name a single person, a single expert, who supports it, despite the fact that this measure has been proposed now for 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, of course, do acknowledge that drug addiction is a very significant problem in many, many parts of Australia and that more needs to be done. But our response in this parliament has to be based on the evidence; it needs to be based on what works. Let's just be very clear about the complete lack of support that this policy proposal has from the experts, and I've got a very long list. The trial is opposed by the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Australasian Chapter of Addiction Medicine, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, St Vincent's Health Australia, the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, Harm Reduction Australia, the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, the Penington Institute, the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales, the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association, the Australian Council of Social Service, UnitingCare Australia, Homelessness Australia, St Vincent de Paul Society, the Wayside Chapel, Anglicare, Catholic Social Services Australia, the National Social Security Rights Network, Odyssey House, Jobs Australia, Community Mental Health Australia, the Public Health Association of Australia, and the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services. What an extraordinary list of experts, all of whom oppose this legislation. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was an open letter to the Prime Minister from 109 addiction specialists, 330 doctors and 208 registered nurses, calling on him to stop this drug-testing trial. The Australian Medical Association described this measure as 'mean and stigmatising'. It went on:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The AMA considers substance dependence to be a serious health problem, one that is associated with high rates of disability and mortality. The AMA firmly believes that those affected should be treated in the same way as other patients with serious health conditions, including access to treatment and supports to recovery.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">International experience shows when you push people to the brink, like removing their welfare payments, things just get worse …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be more crime, more family violence, more distress within society … Had [the government] spoken to the various bodies who work in this area and know about this work, we would have been able to advise them this is not the right way.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One article reported:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Pennington Institute chief executive John Ryan has called for the bill to be scrapped. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">'These are people who rely on these social security payments for the bare necessities and this plan risks pushing them into crime or homelessness,' he said.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Senate committee inquiry heard from a number of witnesses that there is no evidence to suggest that testing jobseekers for drugs will assist them to find work or encourage those who do live with drug dependence to access treatment. Professor Adrian Reynolds, an expert in addiction medicine, said that the drug-testing trial is 'unlikely to bring about any sustained changes in patients' drug use behaviours and may even be counterproductive'. Additionally, Professor Reynolds said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… this drug testing trial is clinically inappropriate and not designed in a way that will address the issues of substance dependence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A leading researcher in the area, Professor Lisa Maher, explained further:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the proposed measures are inconsistent with evidence based approaches to public policy … the Australian National Council on Drugs, concluded that there is no evidence that drug testing welfare beneficiaries will have any positive effects for those individuals or society and some evidence indicating that such a practice could have high social and economic costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there has been a resounding rejection of this trial by the medical and drug treatment experts. The government, of course, is totally ignoring each and every one of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk briefly about the current problem with current waiting times to access rehabilitation services. Right across Australia, it's estimated that there are approximately 1,500 publicly funded drug and alcohol rehabilitation beds, dealing with more than 32,000 requests. Often waiting lists become so long that applicants are no longer accepted onto the waiting lists. If this government were serious about addressing drug addiction in the community, it would do so much more to address this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how does the bill say that this trial would work? Newstart and youth allowance recipients in the three trial locations will be randomly selected and notified of a requirement to attend an appointment with the department. At this appointment, they'll be notified of a requirement to provide a sample of saliva, urine or hair for the purposes of a drug test. Addiction medicine specialists have raised serious concerns about the technical aspects of this part of the trial. With lower cost tests, there is a risk of false positives—for example, if a person is taking antidepressants, they could test positive for amphetamines. Reliable tests can be extremely costly and are likely to be unaffordable. For instance, according to the RACP, a best-practice urine test costs between $550 and $950 to administer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recipients who test positive to the initial drug test will be put on income management for a period of 24 months. Jobseekers will have the option to dispute the result of a positive test and to request a retest. If the retest is also positive, the jobseeker will have to repay the cost of the test. Jobseekers who return a positive test result will be subject to a second drug test within 25 working days. If the jobseeker tests positive to the second test, they will need to repay the cost of the test and will then get access to treatment services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Alison Ritter of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre gave a damning view of this policy. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the bill is not written like a research trial; it's written as policy by stealth … and if this is about introducing new policy, then … it misunderstands the nature of drug problems and drug dependence …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of people have also raised the concern that this testing process will likely encourage people to use less traceable drugs, such as synthetic cannabis, or move to using alcohol or cocaine, which are not being tested as part of the trial.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Drug testing of income support recipients has been tried in several countries and there is no evidence from those trials to suggest that it's effective. In New Zealand the government tried a drug-testing program among welfare recipients in 2015. The results? Out of the 8,001 participants tested, only 22 returned a positive result for illicit drug use. In Utah in the United States, 838 of the state's 9,552 social security applicants were screened, with just 29 returning a positive result. These were very costly experiments that showed that this approach is not worth pursuing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from the Department of Social Services that the estimated number of people that they expect to test positive on the second test is just 120. So the department estimates that just 120 of the 5,000 people tested will actually end up in treatment. But based on the experience in New Zealand, where only 22 people tested positive out of 8,001, you'd have to think that 120 second positive tests out of 5,000 people is a very optimistic estimate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just health and medical experts who oppose this controversial measure. One very prominent critic is former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police Mick Palmer. Mick Palmer was the man who headed John Howard's so-called war on drugs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, so he's not someone who can easily be dismissed as some sort of softie—far from it. Mick Palmer has raised very serious concerns that this trial could see an increase in crime in the trial communities. Mr Palmer said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It certainly hasn't got much chance of reducing crime. It does have the potential in some cases to aggravate it—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">and he means crime. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All of my experience tells me that this won't work. Really what it will do is create more damage, and most damage and most harm to those people who are most vulnerable and most in need of support and protection …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's pretty stark that this can only aggravate an already pretty serious problem and make more vulnerable people who already need more help than they're now getting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this trial could actually see an increase in crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These concerns are being raised by a former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. They should be taken seriously. I urge the Senate crossbench to listen to all of the experts and to listen to Mr Palmer's criticisms and oppose this bill. Labor shares the concerns expressed by Mr Palmer. We are very concerned that this policy will result in increased crime, increased poverty and increased homelessness. We are very concerned that people suffering from addiction will turn away from the social security system entirely, opting for crime as a way to get money to abuse drugs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also apparent from the Senate inquiry that local community support for the trials is not evident. The Mayor of Canterbury Bankstown, one of the trial sites, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... by using our city as the trial site, the government is further stigmatising and discriminating against our local community … </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cities of Logan and Mandurah also told the Senate inquiry that they believe they were being unfairly targeted by being named as a trial area. The Deputy Mayor of Logan said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately for Logan we tend to get targeted for all these sorts of things, and this was just another arrow in the bullseye ... and we seriously get a bit tired of being targeted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Mandurah explained to the committee: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">...we have some concerns that the rationale or justification behind Mandurah being chosen as a site doesn't clearly indicate that Mandurah exclusively has a greater problem than perhaps some of our other regional counterparts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of cost, this government still refuses to reveal the total cost of this trial. They do refer to a $1 million evaluation and to $10 million in treatment services, but they refuse to say how much the trial will actually cost taxpayers. So a year after this was first proposed, they still cannot, or perhaps do not, want to tell us, don't want people to know, how much this will actually cost taxpayers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's important to distinguish the difference between the screening test and the confirmatory test. The screening test, which might be of a salivary sample or for a urine-screening drug test, may be reasonably cheap...but, if you then return a positive test, that is required to be confirmed with a confirmatory test which might be a very expensive process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has said that this policy is based on love, but not one of the doctors who treat people with addiction every single day agree with him—not one of these doctors. This policy is not based on love. It is based on the continued demonisation of Australians who rely on our social security system. It is based on a very crude political calculation that there are votes in yet another crackdown on welfare recipients. It is not based on love at all. The experts say that the changes fail to recognise the complex nature of substance abuse as a health condition. It fails to recognise that this issue should be treated as a health issue, not a welfare issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, I've actually gone out and spoken with people in the drug rehabilitation centre, Odyssey House, in my electorate. They made it patently clear to me that taking away control over people's money won't trigger them to stop using drugs. I sat down and talked to people who are undergoing rehab at Odyssey House, and many of them told me that they abused drugs to mask terrible pain or trauma that happened in their lives, often abuse that they experienced as a child. The motivation to mask that pain and suffering means that they'll find a way to get drugs. In fact, the other thing they said to me was that the trigger that made them seek treatment for addiction was that they were worried about the effect their behaviour was having on their family and the people they love. We've listened to all of these people—the experts who know about how to treat people with addictions, the police, the people themselves affected by drug addiction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I want to particularly acknowledge the contributions that have been made in this debate over recent months by the member for Barton and the member for Bruce. Addiction has touched the lives of the people they love very deeply, and I know this debate has not been easy for them. But, equally, they understand that this is bad policy and something that must be opposed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by saying that Labor, of course, is always open to considering genuine attempts to help people into treatment—attempts that are designed by people who understand addiction and have their best interests at heart. But these proposed changes will hurt people with serious illness, pushing them further into serious financial hardship and crime, and we will not support it. We want to see a genuine attempt to address the very serious problem of drug addiction in our community. It must be based on the evidence and it must be done with the support of the medical, health and community sectors.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265991" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  I rise to support the government's reforms to social welfare. I listened carefully to the speech from the member for Jagajaga before me. It was quite interesting. She pinpointed some statistics, particularly around international trials of this nature, where many, many thousands of people on welfare have been drug tested. I think the numbers she came back with were that 29 in one country and 22 in another country were detected. All I can say is: what an amazing preventative measure this is. If it is stopping people from taking drugs—because they know there is a drug-testing regime—to the point where we are getting such low numbers returned, I see that as a great success and another reason why we should support the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Drug Testing Trial) Bill 2018 and make sure that it happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point the member for Jagajaga made was that, unlike her, people on the other side—I think those were her words—hadn't been to Odyssey House and spoken to those who are addicted. I must say that I haven't been to Odyssey House, but I did spend 17 years as a police officer dealing with drug-addicted people. I saw people in terrible situations addicted to drugs, and they were on welfare. They were some of the most horrible circumstances you can imagine. There were mothers prostituting themselves. I saw kids abused in the most disgraceful way. I saw the absolute lowest standards of living because of drug addiction, and these people were on welfare. And do you know what? They had slipped through the cracks. This bill is about finding those people and helping them. This is not about punishing them. To say that it's too expensive or too hard, as I heard before, is just a disgrace. We have to do everything to help these people. That's what this bill is about. This bill, through the drug-testing trial, will help people take control of their lives. It's aimed at identifying people who need help to break the cycle of addiction and welfare dependency so we can help them into work. This is targeted at Newstart and other welfare designed around employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the best form of welfare is a job. The best way to ensure that people receiving welfare make it into the workforce is, first, to ensure the economy has jobs for them to take and, second, to ensure that they're able to perform those jobs. This means helping those people to have the capacity and the desire to get into work. Australia's annual welfare budget is around $160 billion, accounting for about 35 per cent of the budget. There is no doubt that society needs a social security safety net, and we should be proud of the one that we have in Australia. It needs to be able to help and sustain people who, for whatever reason, need support to get a job, but there also needs to be a degree of mutual obligation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like any other major cohort in Australian society, people receiving welfare are, in the main, very decent, contributing citizens, genuinely trying to live a productive life. But, like in other areas of society, there are some who are caught in a vicious cycle of substance abuse—who spend their money on illicit substances which, in turn, prevent them from getting ahead. The cycle of abuse can destroy lives. We need to take action to stop the cycle and put services in place to help people get their lives back on track. It's a sad reality that drugs are a scourge within many of our communities. Illicit amphetamine use is reaching frightening levels in some places. Over the last decade, drug convictions have increased by some 330 per cent. Tragically, the number of Australians killed by methamphetamine use has doubled in the past six years, with nearly half of those deaths in regional Australia. Illegal drugs are tearing apart families and destroying our communities. What's more, in most cases, behind these victims of drug addiction are those seeking to profit through the production, supply and trafficking of drugs to these vulnerable people. The scum of society are predominantly members of organised crime or outlaw motorcycle gangs, which are really one and the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Substance abuse has many contributing factors. Welfare dependency is just one factor, but it is one that government is able to influence but has neglected for some time. In society, drug addiction can contribute to a cultural dependence which, when passed on from generation to generation, becomes a difficult cycle to break. There are around 100,000 people receiving welfare support who have breached their mutual obligation tasks. If drug dependency is the cause of this, we need to identify it and we need to help these people. There is considerable research which shows that substance abuse does prevent some people from working and contributing to society. The data shows that in 2017 there were over 4,850 occasions when jobseekers cited substance dependency as an excuse for not meeting their mutual obligation requirements. In September of last year, around 5,200 people were temporarily exempt from their mutual obligation because of drug and alcohol dependence and abuse, an 86 per cent increase since 2011. Is what has been identified the tip of the iceberg? That's what we need to know. How many more of these 100,000 people need our help desperately?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that the government has responded to these challenges by establishing the drug-testing trial for 5,000 new Newstart and other youth allowance recipients. They will be in three discrete locations: Canterbury Bankstown, Logan and Mandurah. These locations were selected on the basis of thorough research which examined crime and drug-use statistics. As part of the new package worth $10 million, jobseekers who test positive will be helped by being placed on income management and given essential support to deal with their substance abuse. For the first time, substance abuse treatment will be an approved activity within welfare recipients' job plans, giving them an incentive to get treatment, rehabilitate and find a job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If someone refuses to take the test, the government's response is very clear: they will not get the benefit. This is not about cutting the social security safety net. Jobseekers who return an initial positive test will continue to receive the same amount in welfare payments. It's about giving those who do test positive the tools to take control of their lives and once again be productive members of society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tests will be carried out by contracted drug tester providers, and jobseekers will have the right to dispute a positive return and request a retest. After the two-year trial, a thorough evaluation will be conducted with stakeholders and experts, and this will inform the government on the possibility of rolling out the testing more broadly in high-risk areas. I believe in evidence based policy. While I do not want to second-guess the outcome of this two-year trial, there's no reason not to give it a go. It's incumbent upon us to try and save vulnerable people, for their own sake and for their family's sake. As a policeman, I know too well the scourge of drugs in regional communities. If the trial gets even one young person off these destroying poisons then it's worth doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The trial comes in addition to a suite of reforms to social services payment agreements, including the introduction of a demerit point style system to target people that game the system. These measures will return welfare to the support system it was designed to be—for people looking for a hand up rather than a handout. This is all part of the coalition's comprehensive plan to reduce drug and alcohol abuse, providing $689 million since 2016, including almost $300 million over four years as part of the National Ice Action Strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's disappointing that our political opponents are more supportive of raiding superannuation accounts of pensioners and senior Australians than supporting a program that will help to prevent taxpayer funds being stripped from the addicted and going to criminal motorcycle gangs. The Labor and Greens approach encourages those addicted to drugs to avoid identification, keeping them in the cycle of unemployment, poverty and abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as I'm concerned, if you're being paid by the taxpayer to look for work or do a job, they have every right to know what's going on and whether you're fit to do that task. When I was a policeman there was, rightly, a drug and alcohol testing regime, and I didn't hear any civil libertarians jumping up and down about how unfair that was. As a member of parliament, I'd have no problems with or reservation about submitting myself to a drug and alcohol test at any time, and I wouldn't have any problem with seeing these tests extended to the judiciary as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Minister Tehan and the Attorney-General for spearheading these innovative reforms to the welfare system. I look forward to working with them in the future to reduce the impact of drugs in regional communities. The government knows that there is much more needed to reduce drug use and get unemployed Australians back to work. But the first step has to be an acknowledgement that people have to take responsibility for their own actions. This trial will help them do that and, together with adequate support, it will help them end their dependency and become productive members of society.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00ATG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SHORTEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maribyrnong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:31</span>):  My fellow Australians, as I listened to the government's fifth budget on Tuesday night, I knew immediately we can do better than this, the people of Australia deserve better than this and a Labor government will deliver better than this—better than 10 years of cuts to schools and hospitals in exchange for $10 a week. Ten dollars a week! That's all that the Liberals think it will take for you to forgive and forget. They think that for $10 you'll forget they tried to put up your taxes last year, that for $10 you won't care about the cuts to your child's school, that for $10 you'll forgive waiting for elective surgery at Australia's hospitals and that for $10 you won't mind if your Internet's no good or your local TAFE is closing or your daughter can't find a place at uni. They think that, if you get $10 a week, you won't notice that you're losing $70 in penalty rates from your Sunday pay. This Prime Minister is so out of touch. He thinks that, if you get $10 a week, you'll be fine with the banks getting a $17 billion giveaway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals desperately want you to believe that this budget is fair, but here's what the Prime Minister isn't telling you: his $715 million cut to hospitals is still in the budget; his $17 billion cut to schools is still in the budget; and his $80 billion handout to big business, banks and multinationals is most certainly still in the budget. This budget still cuts money from our universities, and it contains a sneaky new $270 million cut to TAFE. The Prime Minister's still cutting $14 from pensioners every fortnight. He's cutting dental care for veterans. He's cutting the ABC, yet again. He's keeping Medicare frozen for specialist visits. He's even keeping the GST on tampons. And he is still increasing the retirement age to 70. So tonight Australians should ask themselves: if your family relies on any of these services, what kind of future is this Prime Minister really offering you?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My fellow Australians, I'm here to outline Labor's plan to bring the fair go back into the heart of our nation, a plan to properly fund health and education, a plan to boost your wages and a plan for real tax cuts to help you with your family budget. It's a plan that we can afford, because we are not going to spend $80 billion of tax expenditure on big business and the big banks. It's a plan that will work, because Australia thrives when middle- and working-class Australians can get ahead. Tonight is about a fair go for everyone who wants the best for their kids and their future, a fair go for every part of our nation, from bush to coast, from growing cities and suburbs right throughout the country, a fair go for the real forgotten people: working families, pensioners, and Australians doing it tough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan begins with a better and fairer tax system. After years of flat wages, rising power bills and increasing health costs under the government, it is a time for a fair dinkum tax cut for middle-class and working-class Australians. I've already said that Labor will support the government's modest tax cuts, starting on 1 July this year. But tonight I'm pleased to announce that a Labor government will go further and do better on tax cuts for working-class and middle-class Australians. Tonight, I'm pleased to advise that in our first budget we will deliver a bigger, better and fairer tax cut for 10 million working Australians—almost double, in fact, what the government offered on Tuesday. This is our pledge to 10 million working Australians: under Labor you will pay less income tax because I think that you are more important than multinationals, big banks and big business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our first term of government, a teacher earning $65,000 will be $2,780 better off under Labor, an extra $928 each year. A married couple, one serving in our defence forces earning $90,000 and the other working in aged care on $50,000, will be $5,565 better off under Labor, a combined $1,855 extra each year under Labor. We can afford to do more to help these 10 million Australians because we are not giving $80 billion to big business and the big four banks and because we have already made hard choices for budget repair: creating a level playing field for first home buyers by reforming negative gearing and capital gains; cracking down on tax minimisation by eliminating income splitting in discretionary trusts, without affecting our farmers; and ending unsustainable tax refunds for people who currently pay no income tax, while protecting pensioners and charities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the next election there will be a very clear choice on tax: 10 million Australians will pay less income tax under Labor, and we can afford to cut the taxes of 10 million Australians without cutting services, because unlike the Liberals we are not wasting $80 billion on a discredited corporate tax giveaway to the top end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's plans mean that we can deliver a winning trifecta in government: a genuine tax cut for middle-class and working-class Australians; proper funding for hospitals, schools and the safety net; and paying back more of Australia's national debt faster. There was a time, I remember, when the Liberals ran around saying that a national debt of $227 billion was a budget emergency. There was a time, I remember, when they were first elected, that they said that every man, woman and child owed $9,000. But on Tuesday night I do not remember hearing the Treasurer admit that national debt has more than doubled under the Liberals. I do not remember him admitting that it's now $21,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. I do not remember him admitting that next year total interest payments on national debt will pass $18 billion—$18 billion every year, Treasurer; that's what you've achieved. It is more than the Commonwealth spends on the NDIS, or aged care, or child care. It's about twice as much as Australia spends on our public schools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Liberals' only strategy is to cross their fingers and hope. This is not good enough in a time of trade conflict between America and China, in an age of soaring global debt and rising US bond markets. No Australian government can prevent global bad news, but good governments prepare for it. It may not be politically fashionable but it is time to be responsible. Labor's economic reforms put us in a much stronger position to cope with international uncertainty over the coming decade. We can pay down national debt faster because we're not giving $80 billion away to multinationals and because we have made the tough decisions to reform our taxation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Tuesday night we discovered that the Liberals are planning to radically rewrite the tax rules of the nation, and the more that Australians learn about this latest scheme, the less they like it. How on earth can it be fair for a nurse on $40,000 to pay the same tax rate as a doctor on $200,000 or for a cleaner to pay the same tax rate as a CEO? How can it be fair that, under this tax experiment, the doctor earns five times as much as the nurse but his tax cut is 16 times bigger? Today, new research has revealed that, under this plan, $6 in every $10 will go to the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians. Very quickly, this is looking like another mates rates tax plan from the Liberal Party. At a time of flat wages, growing inequality and a greater sense of unfairness in this community, when too many jobseekers are stuck in poverty, when children go to school hungry, when women fleeing family violence cannot find safe accommodation, people are worried that this plan is neither fair nor affordable. Frankly, Australians are entitled to be pretty sceptical of the whole thing and to wonder if this 'come and talk to me after two elections' plan, this promise on the never-never, will ever happen. My team and I are ready to vote for tax cuts for working families. We will not allow the Prime Minister to threaten to block tax cuts for 10 million Aussies unless the parliament writes a cheque for high-income earners seven years hence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian understands that wages have grown by just two per cent in the past year, slower than the price of things you need to buy, way less than your bills. Yet this government in its budget is pretending that wages will increase by over 13 per cent in the next four years. We know that the Liberals haven't the slightest idea of how this will be achieved. And, when the current wages system is demonstrably not delivering for workers, they are dreaming if they think that same system will magically deliver much better outcomes. Tonight, Labor have shown that we are a party of lower taxes for working and middle-class families, and for more than 120 years we have been the party of higher wages for workers. We have a real wages policy. Our wages policy will restore Sunday penalty rates. We will crack down on wages theft, the abuse of labour hire where companies shift their permanent jobs onto labour hire jobs just to cut their pay. We will get enterprise bargaining off life support and employees and employers back to the negotiating table for more productive workplaces, more profitable enterprises and higher wages. We will lead a new push to deliver genuine pay equity for Australia's working women. Labor's wages policy is better for workers; our income tax policy is better for households; and both are better for the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also got real plans for job creation. We are committed to a tax cut for every Australian small business, for 93 per cent of all Australian businesses. We will provide tax incentives for companies who invest here in their own productivity, in new plant and equipment—new utes for tradies, new software, new technology—and our advanced manufacturing future fund will ensure that auto firms abandoned by the current governments in South Australia and Victoria can adapt and modernise. Our commitments to defence, manufacturing and local procurement, to agriculture, science and research, to tourism and renewable energy and to a better NBN are all about creating the jobs and industries for Australia's future. We can afford to invest in small business, productivity and growth because we choose Australian small businesses and Australian jobs over tax giveaways for multinationals, big banks and big business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past couple of days, we've heard the government boast about record funding for hospitals. Let us take a closer look at this record. The cost of seeing a doctor is the highest on record. The average wait time for elective surgery is the longest on record. The number of hospital beds available for elderly Australians is the lowest on record. The number of people presenting in emergency departments is the highest on record—and yet one in three patients considered urgent don't get seen on time. But, in this budget, the government locked in a further cut of $2.1 billion to hospitals across every part of the nation. The health of Australians should never take a back seat to a hand-out for big business. Tonight, I'm pleased to announce Labor will reverse the Prime Minister's cuts to hospitals and create a $2.8 billion better hospitals fund. We'll put more beds in emergency departments and on the wards so we can reduce the wait for people sitting in emergency rooms, worrying about a child or a loved one who's hurt or unwell. Our fund will launch a blitz on waiting lists for elective surgery so people can get that knee replacement to walk without pain, or have their cataracts removed so they can watch their grandchildren grow up. We'll start in Tasmania, which has the worst waiting times in the nation—a year waiting for cataracts and up to 435 days for a knee replacement. And our fund will upgrade emergency department facilities in the suburbs and the regions, including better security measures for staff and patients to handle the scourge of ice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If someone you love has cancer, it consumes your whole world. It is a terrible disease. Chloe and I have been through it with dear friends. My own mum battled breast cancer for many years. As everyone who has been part of the fight knows, there are endless scans and tests involved. For too many people outside our big cities, either their hospital does not have an MRI machine or it's not covered by Medicare. If you live in Emerald, you have to drive three hours to Rockhampton, or you have to pay hundreds of dollars out of your own pocket each time. Cancer does not care where you live or who it strikes, and you should never have to worry about where to go to get the treatment that you can afford. Health care should just be there for you when you need it. That's what Medicare's all about. Tonight I'm pleased to announce that Labor will provide new MRIs to 20 hospitals and imaging centres in the regions and outer suburbs so Australians have a better level of care, and we will make sure that every one of these machines is covered by Medicare. And we can properly fund our hospitals, reverse the cuts of the government and invest new money in Medicare because we've made hard choices on tax reform and because we're not wasting billions on big business and big banks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also believe every government has a responsibility to leave the nation better than we find it. That is why we will create a national integrity commission, a federal ICAC, to improve accountability of politics and public life. And we will do the right thing by people who've been let down by social institutions—national redress for the courageous survivors of child sex abuse, and new healing initiatives for the stolen generations and to reduce the shocking number of Aboriginal kids growing up away from country and culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will ensure justice for people who have been ripped off by the banks. The banking royal commission has lifted the lid, at long last, on a pathology of exploitation. After years of trying to stop the royal commission, in this budget the Prime Minister is giving the big four banks $17 billion of taxpayer money, but it's cutting money from ASIC, its tough cop on the beat. This is a disgrace, it is immoral and Labor will have no part of your actions. The government tried talking tough on this, but wagging your finger in the banks' faces means little when you're giving them a tax cut with your other hand, and upping penalties will do nothing if corporate criminals with deep pockets and big legal teams know they can outspend the government. That is why tonight I announce that Labor will create a special task force inside the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to see justice done. We will deliver $25 million in funding to make sure that public prosecutors have the resources to follow through on the work of the royal commission. In this fight, as always, we stand on the side of ordinary Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every budget should strive to deliver Australians a better deal today, but I understand that so many of the sacrifices people make are about tomorrow, about passing on a better set of opportunities for their children. But this budget does nothing for the next generation; it betrays them. Young Australians always get a dud deal from a conservative government. Young people volunteer, give back to our community, work to support their studies, pay their GST, are funding Medicare and contribute to super from their first day on the job. In return, the Liberals are cutting school funding, closing off university opportunities, taking us backwards on climate change, locking first home buyers out of the market and making it harder to get an apprenticeship or go to TAFE. Young Australians deserve better, so tonight I promise young Australians: Labor will create a level playing field for first home buyers, because I don't want us to live in a country where your only chance of owning a home is to inherit one. We're serious too about tackling climate change and helping the environment: 50 per cent renewables by 2030, a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 and zero net emissions by 2050. I promise young Australians: we will not leave you a ruined reef and rivers and oceans choked with waste, and we will always invest in your education—schools, TAFE and uni—because we know that when you get opportunities Australia gets opportunities. When you succeed, Australia succeeds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My twin brother, Robert, is here tonight, so happy birthday for Saturday. He knows that our mother sacrificed everything for our education, and it changed our lives. If I'm elected Prime Minister, I'll make it my mission to ensure that every Australian child gets the life-changing opportunity of a properly funded, quality education: reading and writing, maths and coding, science and languages, individual attention in the classroom and protection from bullying, be it online or in the schoolyard. I want children to discover and fall in love with what they're good at, and I want every public school to be able to offer music, drama, sport and camps. This government can announce as many education reviews as it wants; everyone knows that cutting school funding does not deliver better results. That is why Labor will put back every dollar the Liberals have cut from schools. The government's cuts have hit public schools and their 2½ million students the hardest. It's public schools that will benefit the most when we invest and restore the extra $17 billion over the next 10 years. It's our public system teaching 82 per cent of Australia's poorest kids, 84 per cent of Indigenous kids and 74 per cent of children with disabilities. We want the same when it comes to schools, the very best. So, when it comes to schools at the next election, the choice is simple: Labor will put $17 billion back into the schools and the Prime Minister will put $17 billion back into banks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nine out of 10 new jobs created in the next four years will need either a university degree or a TAFE qualification. It's why Labor believes in quality universities and strong public TAFEs, working side by side, equal partners in our nation's future. Yet, in this budget, the Liberals are cutting more money from university and TAFE. In government, Labor uncapped degree places and opened the doors of university to a new generation. Tens of thousands of students became the first person in their family to go to university. That's the fair go in action. But the Liberal freeze on university funding means 10,000 fewer places are available next year. By 2032, over 200,000 people will miss out. Millions of families in our regions want their child to go to an Australian university. They understand what it means to hold a degree from our country. The government's freeze won't affect them. No, it will simply lock out working-class kids and students from regional Australia. So tonight I am pleased to announce that Labor will restore funding certainty to our universities and we will uncap places, providing our nation with more than 200,000 university graduates. Under Labor, a university education is not a privilege you inherit; it's an opportunity you earn. We will always choose better university opportunities over better tax breaks for the big end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's plan for training is crystal clear. We will stop the slide to dodgy private providers and back public TAFE all the way. We'll renovate the campuses and rebuild the workshops. We'll ensure that, as a minimum, two out of three of our training dollars go to public TAFE. We will invest in programs to help older workers retrain in later life. We already know the expertise our nation will need in the next decade: more workers for the NDIS and in aged care; more construction workers for national infrastructure and housing; and more programmers and technicians for the digital age. I don't want Australia to meet these needs with skills visas; I want to train our people for these jobs. There is no excuse for a skills vacancy to last one day longer than it takes to train an Australian to do that job. So tonight I am pleased to announce that a Labor government will cover all up-front fees of 100,000 TAFE places in our first term in high-priority sectors from ag and engineering to disability and plumbing. We would expect at least half of these opportunities to go to the women of Australia. We'll get jobs like carpenters, cooks and bricklayers off the national skills shortage list and we will keep them off it. Instead of looking overseas or relying on temporary visas, employers will have a skilled local workforce ready to go. And we can make this happen because we put 100,000 TAFE places ahead of $80 billion of corporate tax giveaway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget falls hardest on the young and the old. The Prime Minister is still cutting $14 a fortnight from pensioners, still telling Australians to work until they're 70, with no idea what it means to people who've spent their lives doing jobs that are hard on their bodies and tough on their backs. But I actually think that one of the sneakiest tricks in this year's budget is the fraud perpetrated on Australians in need of aged care. Around 105,000 older Australians are waiting for homecare packages. Despite all the hype, the government is offering only 14,000 places over the next four years. That's 14,000 places in four years, when 20,000 people joined the waiting list in the last six months alone. Worse still, in question time today we learned that there is no new funding here. They're simply taking the money away from residential care places and putting it into homecare places—nothing new. The people who raised us, cared for us and loved us deserve so much better than this money-go-round in aged care, cuts to their energy supplement and the world's oldest retirement age. If I'm Prime Minister, tackling dementia and delivering better aged care will be a national priority backed by real resources, because we know that giving older Australians the security and dignity they deserve matters more than an $80 billion corporate tax cut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The same Liberal accounting trickery is at work in infrastructure. Across the four years of this budget, Commonwealth investment in infrastructure projects actually falls from $8 billion to $4½ billion. For the Western Sydney rail link, there's only money for a study—a report. The same goes for the train to Tullamarine—not a single dollar for construction. Apparently, this government can do it for free! Only Labor believes in nation building and in good public transport projects, like Cross River Rail, in Brisbane, or the Western Sydney rail line. When we invest in tourism infrastructure in northern Australia and Tasmania, when we improve the Bass Highway in Tassie, when we expand the Mitchell Freeway to cut congestion in WA and when we deliver long-overdue upgrades to the Bruce Highway, in Queensland—when we fund and build these projects—we'll prioritise Australian-made steel, we'll prioritise local workers and we'll require that one in every 10 people employed is an Australian apprentice. Labor can put real dollars into Australian infrastructure because we are not going to give $80 billion to multinationals and big corporations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in conclusion, my fellow Australians, here is what the fair go means under a Labor government: rescuing hospitals and reinvesting in Medicare; proper funding for schools, TAFE and university; and a bigger, better income tax cut for 10 million working Australians. This is our plan, and this is my challenge to the Prime Minister: if you think that your budget is fair, if you think that your sneaky cuts can survive scrutiny, put it to the test. Put it to the test in Caboolture. Put it to the test in Burnie. Put it to the test in Fremantle and in Perth. I will put my better, fairer, bigger income tax cut against yours. I'll put my plans to rescue hospitals and fund Medicare against your cuts. I'll put my plans to properly fund schools against your cuts. I'll put my plan to boost wages against your plan to cut penalty rates. I'll put my plans for 100,000 TAFE places against your cuts to apprenticeships and training. I'll fight for the ABC against your cuts. House by house, street by street and suburb by suburb, my team and I will make this a referendum on your $80 billion corporate tax giveaway to multinationals, big business and the big banks. This nation needs a leader that gets it; it needs a party with a plan for the future; and it needs a government that will deliver a fair go for all Australians. That is what we deliver. That is our promise.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  I've been visiting childcare centres in my electorate, from Blaxland to Blackheath and across the Hawkesbury, including Pitt Town preschool; Richmond preschool, which had its 41st birthday last month; and Greenhills in South Windsor. I've met with Euroka preschool in Blaxland, where parents have petitioned to see an increase in wages for their children's early educators. Early childhood educators are some of the lowest paid professionals in the country, receiving as low as $21 an hour. Parents know that the people they entrust their kids to deserve more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the many things missing from the budget was funding for early childhood education. There was no new funding for universal access to early childhood education in this budget. The changes to the childcare subsidy that start in July are also causing serious concern, with one in four families worse off. One of the consequences being raised with me by parents is that two-parent families where one parent works and the other stays at home have been overlooked by the government's changes to child care. These are families whose combined family income falls between the $66,000 and $171,000 bracket. The new activity test means that a stay-at-home parent with a child younger than four will have to work or study a minimum of eight hours each week to access any subsidised hours. If you don't meet those requirements, your care isn't subsidised. When you're a mum or a dad who's the primary carer for a couple of small children, you may not also be working outside the home. In fact, I seem to remember not being able to manage to make it out of pyjamas some days when I was looking after two small children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Long day care centres tell me the loss of subsidy is already leading to parents indicating they'll have to reduce or cut entirely their child's days of care, when we know the educational benefits good-quality child care provides. Parents and centres tell me they're confused and anxious about how they're going to be affected. Childcare centres will now be required to log the exact hours of when children enter and leave care—a deluge of paperwork. Parents will need to report changes to their work—a nightmare for casual workers. Parents and directors tell me information that clearly outlines the changes and the impacts on families hasn't reached those who need it most. The myGov site is difficult for many families to navigate, and parents report that Centrelink can't provide answers until after 2 July. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care is not simply, as this government believes, about babysitting so that parents can work. Everything we know about child development tells us the early education we do with children under the age of five, before they go to school, is vital; it's an investment in their future education and prospects. If children miss out on a preschool education because of this package, that is a fail for our newest generation and a fail for this government.</span>

                  <a href="00AN0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CIOBO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I rise to speak about the recently completed and I must say very successful Commonwealth Games that took place on the Gold Coast. This was an opportunity to showcase not just the Gold Coast but the south-east corner of Queensland to the world. I want to pay credit to the volunteers, who we call the Games Shapers. There were 15,000 or so, drawn from all parts of Queensland and, indeed, from New South Wales, many of them from my own electorate. They came to do their bit to showcase a very warm welcome, some local knowledge and a bit of good humour about the Commonwealth Games. We had athletes come from around the world, and the Australian team in particular did exceptionally well, scoring something like 198 medals across events. They were a true credit to our country, and it really reflects so positively on them, and indeed on all proud Gold Coasters, that this was, I think it's fair to say, the best Commonwealth Games that have been hosted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly acknowledge the fact that so many local members of the community and businesses also did their part. Although they may not have been officially involved, the community really rallied behind these Commonwealth Games. The spirit in the city was strong. And I've got to say, as the local federal member, with Metricon Stadium in my actual electorate, that it was so exciting to be able to participate in many of the games's activities. Truly, you got a buzz from just walking around, being and mixing with locals on the streets and the many thousands of tourists who came, as well as the athletes, their support staff and their loving family members—all of them just revelling in what was a very successful Commonwealth Games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also showcased the close cooperation between the federal, state and local governments. All three tiers worked alongside each other to make sure that the delivery of the Commonwealth Games was very successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some aspects—and I want to acknowledge them—where local businesses felt that crowd numbers were down because of some of the preliminary campaign in relation to the amount of traffic that people were expecting on the Gold Coast. Whilst acknowledging that that was disappointing for many local traders, in no way, shape or form should it overshadow the overall success of the games.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I had the chance to host my local sporting champions. At that event I spoke to local schoolkids who are participating, often at elite levels, in local sports, and you could see that they were beaming with pride as they thought that, one day, they too might be Commonwealth or Olympic athletes for their country. So the example that was set by our Commonwealth Games team really is an inspiration for them, as is the superb work of the 15,000 volunteers, and I simply cannot express enough my gratitude for the way in which they held our country up.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  This week's federal budget was a congestion-busting one for the Sunshine Coast that will let people keep more of their own money, strengthen our local economy and give older Australians more choice in their retirement. My No. 1 priority is delivering the Bruce Highway upgrades that we need. This year's budget allocated an extra $880 million towards three-laning the remaining sections of the highway from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane. That's on top of another $800 million for the Cooroy to Curra section, section D, just north of my electorate of Fisher. In less than two years, we've invested more than $3.4 billion in the Bruce Highway, just in our region alone. That's going to get local commuters home to their families sooner and more safely and ensure that tourists' abiding memory of our region is of the scenery of their dreams, not a congestion nightmare. However, we need more than just a better highway to solve our transport woes. This year's budget delivers there too, with a commitment of $390 million to duplicate the north coast railway line between Beerburrum and Landsborough. This will allow us to deliver more reliable and frequent rail services and get more heavy trucks off the Bruce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this government's job-creating policies, times are good on the coast, with low unemployment and hundreds moving from welfare to work. But cost-of-living pressures remain high. This budget delivers lower taxes to more than 60,000 Sunshine Coast residents, which will let them keep up to $530 more of their pay every year. Over time, this budget will ensure that 94 per cent of Sunshine Coast taxpayers and, in fact, all Australian taxpayers, never have to pay more than 32½c in the dollar and ensure that it will always pay to work that extra hour or get that second job. For older Sunshine Coasters, this budget will let them earn up to $300 a fortnight from part-time work or owning a business without it affecting their pension. My Fisher Seniors Council and many other older residents have asked me about this important reform, to give them more choice and a more comfortable retirement, and this budget has delivered for them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased to see that our hardworking chaplains, like Chappy Kelly Davis at Meridan State College and Chappy Mike Turner at Beerwah High, will continue to be supported, with a further $247 million for the National School Chaplaincy Program. I joined colleagues on our side of the House in advocating for this outcome and am particularly pleased to see that our chappies are receiving additional funding. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SWAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  Senior Australians who have worked hard all their lives to make our country great are being neglected by the Turnbull government. The government are holding older Australians in a vice grip. On one side, they've slashed funding for aged-care facilities, ripping out $1.2 billion in the 2016 budget. On the other side, they've fallen pathetically short in funding in-home care. While more than 100,000 older Australians languish in the queue for in-home care packages, this government only found funds for a pitiful 3,500 packages in the budget. Just last Sunday, the Minister for Health and Aged Care said: 'It's going to be a very good budget for health and for aged care in particular.' If the government consider their budget a very good one for aged care, I'd really hate to see a bad one. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, this is a bad budget for aged care and older Australians. It does nothing to address the crisis in aged care which we are seeing playing out in aged-care facilities across the country, and these matters will be revisited before the next budget, because the crisis is acute. Basic elements of care, including showering, brushing teeth and providing food and water to senior Australians, are being neglected and missed more and more frequently. Aged-care providers have cut staff numbers so deeply that it's not uncommon for one registered nurse to be allocated to up to 200 elderly residents. Understaffing means that rather than receiving four or more hours of nursing a day our most vulnerable older Australians are losing one-third of this crucial time needed for showering, toileting and being medicated, dressed, fed and more. Vital care has been missed, which has real and sometimes fatal consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that moving into an aged-care facility can be an emotional and stressful time. That's why it's vital that we as legislators work to make aged care decent and comfortable for older Australians. This begins with legislating minimum staffing requirements and adequate skill mixes in aged-care facilities, and for in-home care it means providing enough aged-care packages to meet the demand of older Australians—not the pathetic package that this government has put forward in this pathetic budget. We must loosen the vice grip that the government has tightened around older Australians. They deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, on indulgence, I note that today is 25 years since my first speech in this building. In this constituency statement I would like to thank each and every one of my electors, who have supported me for a long period of time. Twenty-five years ago I promised to work hard, to listen to their views and to strongly represent their interests in this place. I hope I've gone some way towards honouring that promise for the people of Lilley, and I thank them for their trust and for their support.</span>

We're making income tax lower, fairer and simpler. Our plan is affordable and will be implemented over seven years in three steps. It'll provide tax relief now for lower- and middle-income earners. In the next financial year, four million Australians will get tax relief of $530 annually, and over 10 million taxpayers overall will get tax relief. We are lifting tax brackets to protect Australians from the impact of bracket creep, and we're simplifying taxes and ensuring that more people pay less tax. It is expected that about 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay 32.5 per cent tax or less, which is really good news for low- and medium-income earners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only the Turnbull government rewards hard work, and only our plan underpins a strong economy. The members on our side of the chamber understand how to create an economic environment where job creation is so important, and that's with the support of business, and it is supporting business. The opposition believes that 'business' is a dirty word, that businesses simply make profits. However, we understand that businesses, particularly small businesses, are the backbone of the economy and employ nearly half of all Australians. That's why there have been over 996,000 new jobs since the Turnbull government was elected, including 367,000 in the past 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to job creation and tax cuts, we're providing record funding for essential services—record funding for WA hospitals and schools. The government's spending an average of $4,427 per student in Forrest this year, a figure that will continue to rise. I'm particularly pleased to see in the budget funding for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, for spinal muscular atrophy and for endometriosis, to provide primary health professionals with more information to raise awareness and understanding of this disease, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients. It means better care for women, and health professionals will have a better understanding of treatment pathways, all in addition to the first-ever national endometriosis plan. And I'm very pleased that this budget has delivered funding for the completion of a project for which I've fought for over a decade: the Bunbury Outer Ring Road.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  On many occasions I've raised in the House the dearth of infrastructure in my electorate of Werriwa in the south-west of Sydney: substandard NBN, the need for road and rail upgrades to cope with the construction of the airport, and the lack of parking at railway stations like Glenfield, Macquarie Fields and Edmondson Park. Since my election I've had a constant stream of complaints about the lack of parking at Edmondson Park. Constituents can't find a park in the woefully inadequate car park after 7 am. This is a station that was opened just three years ago, which serves a catchment with a population of more than 40,000 people and is set to grow significantly in the next few years. That's why I commend the commitment by Luke Foley and New South Wales Labor to build a multistorey car park at Edmondson Park if he's elected Premier of New South Wales at the election next year. Commuters have been at their wits' end because of the lack of parking at Edmondson Park. Now there's a firm commitment for the hundreds of people who are simply trying to get to and from work each day. I want to thank the many community members who have been in touch with me about this issue. Your support has helped my colleagues, state member for Macquarie Fields Anoulack Chanthivong and Liverpool councillor Charishma Kaliyanda, and me to successfully advocate this upgrade. I will continue to advocate the overdue access upgrade at Macquarie Fields station.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone in this place knows how hot and dry the last few months have been, particularly in the south-west of Sydney. On 14 April a fire started in bushland in Casula, which is in my electorate, crossed the Georges River and went on to threaten homes in Holsworthy, Wattle Grove and through the Sutherland Shire. Through the expertise and professionalism of emergency services, especially the firefighters, no-one was hurt or injured and the only property lost was a cubbyhouse. This is an incredible achievement. I attended Liverpool Council's thank you event last weekend, where emergency services and volunteers were treated to a barbecue. This was one of the structures originally under threat. I joined with Mayor Wendy Waller of Liverpool Council in recognising the professionalism and bravery of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, the fire brigade, police, St Johns Ambulance, Holsworthy Barracks personnel and the SES.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 April Liverpool and Werriwa lost a special citizen. Uncle Steve Williams died after a battle with cancer. He was a proud Wiradjuri man and an Aboriginal elder in our community. As an accomplished artist, Uncle Steve completed beautiful murals in local schools and community buildings. He was sought after to perform smoking ceremonies and share his cultural knowledge with the wider community. He was an advocate and a voice for the Aboriginal community both in my electorate and further afield. His efforts were recognised when he was named Liverpool Council Citizen of the Year in 2014. His funeral was held in an overflowing chapel. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I rise this morning with a particular eye on a very important part of my electorate. Tomorrow and Saturday, at the Griffith showgrounds, it will be my great pleasure to be back at the Riverina Field Days—the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area's annual showcase of the best agricultural machinery and products available. The Riverina Field Day, like many other agricultural fairs held through the length and breadth of regional Australia, attracts thousands of local people. Like all such days, the two big topics in my region when I get there tomorrow will be the weather and the water. On water, at least the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, I can take back some good news. This week, the Senate was finally able to give some certainty to our local irrigators by securing an agreement to get this plan back on track. The vote to uphold the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism succeeded when Labor joined with us to defeat the Greens' attempt to crush my irrigation communities from Griffith to Gol Gol. This means that work can continue on recovering an additional 450 gigalitres for environment projects, as required by the plan, but with an overriding protection that recovery of this water must be with neutral or improved socioeconomic outcomes. I can assure every single constituent in my electorate that I will be watching this 450 gigalitre recovery process. It's only up to 450 and it's only with improved socioeconomic outcomes; in other words, no change from the existing legislation. I will be watching it very, very closely. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Greens and Labor don't get, unless it suits them politically, is that regional Australia doesn't want to play nasty political games; it just wants to get on with the job of delivering Australia's fastest growing and most important export industry—agriculture. Regional Australia and the ag sector should be pretty happy with this week's budget, with an extra $50 million a year for things such as improved biosecurity, better access to chemicals, and pest and weed prevention. It also includes $4.7 million over four years to better understand seasonal labour demand and supply—an area which is critical to the local workforce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Unfortunately, drought is starting to be spoken about more often. When the Basin Plan was formalised, we were in the middle of the millennium drought. The last thing we need now, as we get towards completion of the plan, is another drought. But, if it is to be, then the government stand ready to assist. Since 2013, we've provided more than $1 billion in assistance measures to help farmers and communities in drought. This includes business concessional loans, household allowance, managing risk and rural financial counselling. If the weather stays, we have a special assistance hotline, meaning farmers can receive the best possible advice to support them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  Two days ago, we saw the delivery of a budget which is very underwhelming and has quite dramatic impacts on the people of the Northern Territory. There are a couple of positive elements, which I'm prepared to acknowledge and actually support. One of which was the announcement of money allocated to the budget for Western Desert Dialysis—that is the Western Desert Nganampa Walytja Palyantjaku Tjutaku Aboriginal Corporation, which delivers dialysis treatment in remote communities in the Northern Territory. As a result of the introduction of a dedicated Medicare item number providing $590 per dialysis treatment will be provided, Aboriginal people who require dialysis will, in the future, be able to have dialysis in their home communities, obviating the need for them to travel to Alice Springs, Katherine, Tennant Creek, Darwin and other places across Australia for that treatment. That will be a very, very good thing. I also absolutely support the $4.8 million for crusted scabies treatment. That's a very important element of dealing with rheumatic heart disease and other illnesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on the whole, the budget is a shocker. We have seen with much fanfare the government talk about announcements of infrastructure, including $100 million for the Buchanan Highway and $180 million for the Central Arnhem Highway. The fact of the matter is: none of this money hits the deck, in reality, for five years or more—beyond the forward estimates period. We're not going to see any real improvements in those roads as a result of this investment for over four years. That's a con, and everyone in their right mind knows it's a con. Just as it's a con, if we read the detail of the budget, that there have been significant cuts in other areas for the Northern Territory, including in cancer care and in remote Aboriginal expenditure to improve school attendance, improve school results, for workforce development, for teacher housing, for community safety, for child safety, to reduce alcohol harm, for housing works, for removing asbestos from uni buildings, and on the Aboriginal Interpreter Service. Why would you be reducing expenditure in those areas? Only the government would know. Black spots improvement funding has been reduced, Roads to Recovery has been reduced, tourism infrastructure has been reduced and there are cuts to legal aid services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, you will recall the government's support for the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory. There's not one dollar—not one!—in this budget for addressing the recommendations in that royal commission report, which this government was a co-author of! Why would you not fund those services? Why would you not? The people of the Northern Territory have wised up to this crowd.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  The iconic Black Rock Life Saving Club has faithfully served the Goldstein community for 89 years. After a lengthy fundraising effort, I would like to congratulate the club on securing the resources for a much needed infrastructure upgrade. This is a huge win for our beach-loving Goldstein community. A year and a half ago, I stood up in parliament and highlighted the decaying state of the Black Rock clubhouse. It was listed as one of the eight clubs, statewide, most in need of urgent renewal by Life Saving Victoria in their audit of 2011. The building regularly flooded, rendering it unfit for purpose. Precious funds were being wasted on constant repairs. Club volunteers were left without basic first aid resources. Local advocates stood up but were consistently frustrated by the opaque allocation of resources for club upgrades across Victoria. It was far from needs based. It was not good enough. But together we called on the state government to finally take a good hard look at their priorities, and it seems that they have finally listened. This is because of the hard work of Black Rock Life Saving Club's advocates, including current president Rebecca Moncrieff, former president Simon Tucker, treasurer Brendan McConnell, vice-president Graeme Eddiehausen, secretary Dave Laws and the ever-irrepressible Emma Olivier. Details of the redevelopment are scarce but, with this new allocation, Life Saving Victoria, with Black Rock, can finally serve our community with the facility they need. A huge thanks also to Murray Thompson, the state member for Sandringham, and the aspirational new representative, Brad Rowswell, for their incredible support. This is a real community constant victory.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Goldstein's success is built on a collective spirit of community-mindedness. Last week we saw that spirit acknowledged when Community Clubs Victoria at their annual awards night, which gives Victoria a chance to celebrate over 1,500 community clubs, officially awarded to the Sandringham Yacht Club the prestigious honour of Club of the Year for 2017. The award is an incredible tribute to the work of people like the CEO, Richard Hewett; the executive team, Helen Tetlow and Paul Corlfield; the functions and events team, Ashlee Patten, Melissa Villella, Paola Barraza, Kristine Fisher and Naomi Smith; the training and development manager, Michah Shuwalow; the boating department, James Sly and Maddie Commins; the accounts department, Paula Robinson-Cooke, Marlize Strydom, Rachael Giannakis and Sharon Tilbrook; the waterfront services team, Paul Gascoigne, Sean Byrne and Karen Crowley; and all the members of and contributors to the Sandringham Yacht Club.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I rise in complete exasperation on behalf of Mr Johnson, who lives with his wife in Noble Park in my electorate, and the tens of thousands of Australians stuck in similar situations. Mr Johnson is a 68-year-old man suffering from diabetes and other serious health problems, and this month marks the one-year anniversary of Mr Johnson's application for the age pension and a pensioner concession card in May 2017. He has had no income for a year, relying on his limited savings while waiting for his pension claim to be processed. He put up with six months of going around in circles with Centrelink before he approached me in December. He waited on the phone, he answered the same questions and he provided the same stuff over and over again. He was advised in person that all the relevant information had been submitted, yet still today his claim has not been finalised. My office tried to resolve it. We're usually pretty good at these things, yet astoundingly Centrelink called him in March to say that his claim had been rejected in December and that a further review was being instigated. Only then did Centrelink think to mention that, as his wife is still working but is over retirement age, she'd be eligible for a work bonus, and asked why she didn't apply in May 2017. Even more bizarrely, Centrelink then suggested he make a fresh application and begin the process again along with his wife. In April I wrote to the minister, yet I still have no reply, not even an acknowledgement. At this point I honestly have no idea what to do to get his claim processed. Perhaps speaking out in parliament will get some action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue for all Australians is that Mr Johnson's experience of waiting for his age pension claim to be processed is now common. We all see it. Because of massive ongoing cuts to Centrelink and Human Services by your mob over there, there are simply not enough skilled, trained staff left to process work and particularly to sort out the more complex cases. Since being elected, this uncaring government has cut 6,000 staff from DHS. You cut another 1,280 in Tuesday's budget. Last year in a speech I made on the budget I said that the privatisation of Centrelink had started, and you all yelled at me and said, 'You're being silly, exaggerating, making it up!' It turns out I was a prophet. The Liberal government—at least they've finally told the truth and stopped lying—are privatising thousands of jobs through corporations such as Serco and labour hire firms. The numbers are in your budget papers. But it's not just about the loss of skilled workers or the waste of taxpayer money on overheads to labour hire workers, which we've proven; people like Mr Johnson, who have worked hard all their lives, should be treated with some respect and deserve to have their pension claims processed. Unfortunately, under the Liberals it's only going to get worse, because they're hell-bent on taking the human out of Human Services and privatising Centrelink—the P word. In the meantime, while all this goes on, what on earth is it going to take for Mr Johnson to get his pension claim processed? Will Centrelink pay him arrears? Will they compensate him for the excess medical bills that he has incurred for a year while waiting?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I'm excited today to talk about what this budget means for the electorate of Dunkley. Firstly, we have budgeted $225 million to see the electrification and duplication of the Frankston rail line to Baxter become a reality. This is a project I've advocated since 2016. It means job creation and connectivity to jobs, education and community. I said in my maiden speech that we shouldn't be disadvantaged by where we live, and with this commitment we are delivering. It means the potential for stations servicing Frankston Hospital, Monash uni, Karingal, Langwarrin and Baxter. It means 'park and ride' closer to people's homes. It means the opportunity for Baxter stabling instead of Seaford stabling, to stop 200 jobs being taken if the state government chooses to go with our project. It means freeing up parking around Frankston, Kananook and Seaford stations as well as Frankston Hospital and the uni. We already have on the table $3 million of federal funding for the business plan that the state government recently commenced. We are calling for the state to now co-contribute $225 million in matching funds. They have put in zero dollars so far. We're also calling for them to complete the business plan by November and work together on topping up funding, depending on the overall cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to talk about what this budget means for many families, particularly those who are struggling with cost-of-living pressures, paying for things for their kids and so forth. Most workers in Dunkley will each receive tax relief of $530 per year, which means an extra $1,060 for a working couple. We'll be eliminating bracket creep so that most workers will now be on the top bracket of 32½ per cent. This means school books, fuel, food and more for families. It also means reduced childcare costs for 6,500 local families, with a subsidy of up to 85 per cent, depending on income, and an elimination of caps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the 27,800 people who are aged over 65 and their families who live in Dunkley, we have policies to help retirees and those in aged care. We have 14,000 more home-care packages so that people can stay at home longer. There are 27,819 people aged over 65 who will benefit. We won't be taking the retirees' franking credits and savings, as Labor intends to do. The pension work bonus will be increased so that age pensioners can earn an extra $50 per fortnight up to $300 per fortnight. And the pension loan scheme will be expanded to give Australians on age pensions the option to boost their income by up to $17,700 for a couple. We're also recognising our growing community by extending the Stronger Communities Program and recognising volunteers and small businesses with our tax cuts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  The budget has been delivered. They've had five years to get it right, and again we see that they have got it wrong—again and again and again. We've seen $80 billion going to big business and corporations. Actually, we don't even know whether it's $80 billion, because yesterday during question time we asked the Prime Minister a number of times how much money this was actually going to cost, how much money was going to go to the big end of town, and the Prime Minister simply shrugged his shoulders and said he had no idea. He was asked that question, and the Treasurer was asked, and not once were we given a definitive answer. He's asking us to vote for a tax cut that he doesn't even know the cost of. Well, I've got to tell you: the Australian community are not mugs. They are not going to be fooled or tricked into taking $10 a week—which, for those of you who don't know or who don't live in the real world, for a single person is not really going to cover the apple bill, the bread bill or the weekly milk bill in a family home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked my community yesterday what they would like the government to do with their $10—because there's this thing called the general public, who have a better idea of what this government could be doing to support families a little bit better. Effie Thiveos said, 'Keep my $10 and fund the NDIS accordingly, and help people like me who are raising a special needs child.' Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, I know that you and I have done great work on the NDIS, and we have a huge issue around the NDIS. Scottey Hickson said, 'You can keep my $10 and give workers back their penalty rates.' Anybody who was earning penalty rates has had $77 ripped away, and now they're getting $10 back. He said: 'Give schools and hospitals back the money that they were promised. And even though I earn too much to get your stupid $10, what do you think a family is actually going to spend it on? My tolls cost me 17 times more than the $10 tax break that they are being offered.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mandy said that you should do something to assist in the aged-care space and pay workers more than $22 an hour. Allison Major suggested that housing affordability could be something that her $10 might be better spent on. Tim Haynes said that he actually couldn't say what he thought the government should do with his $10, because he might be banned from Facebook if he told Scott Morrison what he though of this $10. Oliver Pocock said that he'd spend it on active and engaging policy with young Australians—who I note are sitting in the gallery here today. Another good suggestion was to fund public service, and I note that the member who spoke before me was talking about the cuts to Centrelink and the privatisation of public services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there are a couple of great suggestions from the good people of Lindsay, the community that I'm incredibly proud to represent. I have just one suggestion—maybe I could have back the $98 million that this government has ripped out of my university, the $5 million that it's taken out of my hospital and the $21 million it has taken from my public schools.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  This week's budget has been a great budget for Brisbane. More than 75,000 people in the electorate of Brisbane will receive tax relief in 50 days time. Hardworking people around Brisbane will be keeping more of their own money, their own hard-earned money, as reward for their efforts, because this government's strong economic plan is starting to pay dividends for Australia. A year ago, speaking here on last year's budget, I predicted why supporting Australia's small and medium businesses would pay these dividends. Now we see the evidence that the key planks of this government's strong economic plan are working—the tax relief for small and medium businesses, our innovation agenda, the new free trade agreements and the growth of our defence industry. We can see evidence of these policies working right across Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nationwide, these policies combined to help Australia's small and medium businesses create new jobs last year faster than jobs have ever been created before in Australia's history—a record 1,100 jobs a day in 2017. It means more Australians are being productive and paying taxes, and fewer Australians are relying on welfare. That's a powerful outcome, economically and morally. And it's enabling this government to guarantee essential services, to provide this new record help for seniors, to make a record investment this year in our environment and the Great Barrier Reef, and finally, with certainty, to fully fund the NDIS out of consolidated revenue, all at the same time as being able to give tax relief to the Australians whose hard work and success have made this happen. That's the power of supporting Australia's small and medium businesses. That's the power of supporting hardworking Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A year ago, the Treasurer mentioned the Brisbane Metro in his budget speech, and this week I was delighted that the Treasurer announced $300 million in funding to make the Brisbane Metro project a reality. There's been a lot of hard work put in between those two budget speeches to make that decision happen, and full accolades have to go to the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Graham Quirk, and his deputy, Adrian Schrinner, who built the compelling business case for this project. Infrastructure Australia got it right last month when they assessed the Brisbane Metro as an investment-ready, high-priority infrastructure project with a strong business case. Thank you to all the locals around Brisbane who answered my calls and signed the petitions to help prove how enthusiastic the grassroots community support is for the Brisbane Metro. Your voice has been heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brisbane is becoming more prosperous as this budget builds on last year's budget, as we support our small and medium businesses and hardworking people right across Brisbane. And it's becoming better because of the support we're then able to provide in this budget for the environment, for seniors, for the NDIS and for so many other worthwhile projects. This is a great budget for Brisbane.</span>

                  <a href="DZP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BIRD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I'll take the opportunity in the speeches that follow the budget being handed down on Tuesday night to talk more broadly about the budget, but there's one aspect of it that has made me really angry, and I want to take this short opportunity to put it on the public record. In December last year, I went public in the local Illawarra media about the great frustration, indeed, distress, being caused to older people in my community and their families and also the service providers who work with them. The reason for that was that we'd hit 950 people on the aged-care home care package waiting list in our region—950 people who had been assessed as needing home care support who were trying to sustain themselves in their own homes and needed the support that is provided by these packages, which are important not only to them but also to their families. I have had people in tears on the phone talking about the struggles that families are having as they wait for up to a year—some for more than a year—to get the package that they have already been assessed as needing. I was very frustrated and, on behalf of those older people, their families and our service providers, I went public about that particular issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then in March we got a new, updated report on the state of the packages across the nation. In my area of the Illawarra we'd seen about a 10 per cent increase in that waiting list again. We'd gone from 950 to over 1,000 people. The table in the report makes it clear that this is only people who were not in or assigned an interim level package, so it hides the number of people who need, for example, a level 4 package who've been put on an interim level 2 package. That means the service providers are left having to say to people: 'We're not funded to provide you with the additional support you've been assessed as needing. We're only funded to provide this level.' Many of those providers, out of their own budgets and their own resources, are trying to provide additional support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, I was quite encouraged when I saw the speculation before the budget that the government was going to make a major investment in this space. That is not what we got on Tuesday night. What we got was 14,000 places over four years, when the national waiting list is over 100,000, and that's funded by taking funding out of residential aged care. This is a terrible con on people. It's cruel and unfair. Across my region, there are many families who want to see the government take real action on this crisis in aged care. It's appalling that they were encouraged to think that that was about to happen and it has not.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I am delighted to rise this morning to speak about the players, teams, coaches and volunteers involved in the sport of volleyball in my electorate of Robertson, on the Central Coast. Phil Boxsell, from Macmasters Beach, invited me to Central Coast Volleyball recently. Phil is encouraging people from right across our region to get involved. He said that volleyball is one of the world's most popular sports, with nearly every nation competing competitively on the world stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I'd like to recognise the amazing Central Coast Stingrays, who are the women's representative team, with over 40 women in the program playing both open and age or junior divisions. The teams are coached by Steve Hunter, Graeme Lowe and Chris Ostenfeld, and many will know Steve and his wife, Kelly, who are long-time players who have represented in the highest competition level, the Australian Volleyball League. The Stingrays play regularly in the state league, at state cups, and they have been successful in winning or placing in many of those events. Our Stingrays also compete in the winter season in the Sydney Volleyball League, in the division 1, division 2 and junior levels—again winning and placing in those divisions over the past three years. Phil also told me that five juniors—Kim Meyer, Zoe Boxsell, Ashleigh Meyer, Emelyn Ostenfeld and Eloise Warby—were selected for state programs, with three participating in the Australian Junior Volleyball Championships, the eastern and national university games and the combined high schools New South Wales team. Congratulations to these incredible young people and all of the hardworking and committed volunteers who help make their success a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We love to encourage Australians to be more active more often, which is why this week's budget has delivered a $230 million package of initiatives that I'd like to speak briefly about. This investment in participation at a local, grassroots level will have a significant positive impact on communities across the Central Coast, and I thank the Minister for Sport, whom I'm meeting with today to see how these initiatives may specifically benefit our area. Woy Woy Oval, McEvoy Oval at Umina Beach and Terrigal's Brendan Franklin Oval are just some of the local sportsgrounds we've already delivered funding to to help upgrade since the coalition first came to government, and I'll be fighting to see further improvements locally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering funding of over $50 million to help boost participation in physical activity across the nation, targeted at the less active across all ages and stages of life. There's increased funding to expand the important Local Sporting Champions program—a really popular program locally—to support a further 3,000 athletes, which is a 56 per cent increase. Applications for the next round of this grant program are open, with a closing date of 30 June. The Sporting Schools program will also be extended, to encourage schoolchildren to play sport and be active and to reduce the cost to parents, with up to 1.1 million primary and secondary school students taking part.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  You know, lots of people are standing up and having their few minutes' say on the budget, and I think it's going to continue, because the more and more we unpack of this shocker budget, the more and more we discover just how hopeless this government is. Can you believe that, in the middle of a banking royal commission where we are hearing of the most outrageous misbehaviour of the big four banks and of what's going on in our finance sector, this government has cut $26 million from ASIC, the corporate regulator? Can you believe it? At a time when we need to have our federal government acting on corporate misbehaviour, this government has cut $26 million from ASIC's ability to do its job. There are funding cuts to the AFP and to the Director of Public Prosecutions—the people who will help hold the banks accountable for their corrupt behaviour. No, no, no—on budget night, the government buried funding cuts to the people, their mates, in the banks who are doing the wrong thing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government also cut jobs from Centrelink. When we cannot get the phones answered, when the Centrelink team, the hardworking public servants who work in DHS, are struggling to meet the expectations of community, and when this government is piling work after work onto Centrelink, the government, in their budget, will cut almost 1,300 jobs. It's a disgrace!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have cut $80 million from the ABC. Central Victorians love their ABC. They love the news. They love the local stories. They love the opportunity that it creates for the creative industries, particularly in places like Castlemaine and Bendigo. Yet the government have cut the ABC back to the bone. And why? They don't like the investigative journalism of the ABC. They don't like being held accountable, so they say, 'Let's defund our public broadcaster, whose job it is to hold us accountable.' We know they don't like creatives. We know they don't like the arts sector, with funding cut after funding cut for the arts sector.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Murray</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  The electorate of Murray is home to some of the most diverse and productive agricultural regions of anywhere in Australia, and right at the heart of the Goulburn Valley is irrigation. The Goulburn Valley is often referred to as the food bowl of Australia. Twenty-five per cent of Australia's agriculture comes from the Goulburn Valley and the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District: 28 per cent of our apples, 86 per cent of our pears, over 70 per cent of our peaches and up to a quarter of our total dairy production—all happening in the Goulburn Valley and the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the minister there last week, and I congratulate him because of what he has been able to do with water policy. He's been able to bring the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which was on the brink of failure, back onto the table and now, all of a sudden, we have a plan that is still very much in progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern basin review</span> report was put forward to the parliament earlier this year and, unbelievably, Sarah Hanson-Young from the Greens moved a disallowance motion on the northern basin review. More unbelievable is the fact that the Labor Party then jumped ship, did an about-face and also supported a disallowance motion for a correction in the northern basin review. It was a 70-gigalitre correction. The Labor Party had been silent on this for about 12 months and then all of a sudden, at the last moment, jumped ship because they wanted to placate the interests of South Australia and the Batman by-election. It now seems that the Labor Party have changed back. It looks like they've done a deal and we are going to now have the northern basin review passed. It is very lucky for Victoria that the Victorian state government disagrees with Bill Shorten and Tony Burke. They disagree with the water policy of federal Labor. Thank goodness that state Labor have that difference of opinion with the people in the federal opposition with control of water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sitting at the kitchen tables we can see the uncertainty surrounding many of our agriculturalists. Certainly the 605 gigalitres, now that the SDLs are going to be approved, are going to be a real bonus. We'll be able to put concerns about water behind us. We still have an enormous fight on our hands with Labor and the Greens in relation to the 450 gigalitres upwater. This is a plan where effectively they want another 450 gigalitres of water taken out of active production, taken out of agriculture. They want to take this water for the environment without causing social and economic detriment. Anybody with any idea knows it cannot be done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  Over 80 per cent of Australians trust the ABC and over 84 per cent trust the ABC's news and current affairs. Three quarters of Australians have contact with the ABC every week. In my family, four generations have interactions with the ABC every day. We've been watching and listening to the ABC since it was launched by Prime Minister Joe Lyons in 1932. It's no secret that Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and Mitch Fifield hold the ABC in contempt. They have cut over $250 million from the ABC budget since 2014, and the 2018 budget has further cut ABC funding by $123 million from ongoing funding, including $43 million to support news and current affairs services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the modern world, what this government hates the most is the success the ABC is having with its digital platforms. This is a sign to the government that no matter how much they want to destroy the ABC, the general public has given them the answer. In this era famous for fake news our national broadcaster and its staff provide our country with a high-quality, trustworthy and independent service. I'm sure all members would agree that our nation and indeed our political processes are made all the better thanks to the ABC. Our national broadcaster, through its dedicated reporters—and names such as Andrew Olle, Bill Peach, Richard Carleton, Mike Carlton, Caroline Jones, Margaret Throsby and, more recently, Andrew Probyn, Laura Tingle and Chris Uhlman spring to mind—ensures that governments are held to account for their decisions. We, as politicians, are rightly scrutinised by the broadcaster, no matter how uncomfortably at times. Without this our political processes would lack integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's agenda is quite transparent to me, and it's a shameful disgrace. Despite ripping funding from our national broadcaster, Malcolm Turnbull can find millions of dollars to give to Fox Sports for no particular reason, provide billions to big business and allow big banks to rip money off consumers without scrutiny. There is no fat to cut at the ABC. What fat there was was cut years ago. They are now facing a government intent on death by a thousand cuts. This is a philosophical decision by the government. They hate the ABC and they'll do what they can to destroy it. This will suit the coalition's masters quite well and they're quite happy with it. It's an evolving tragedy. I call on all politicians of integrity to stand firm against this reactionary tide.</span>

I want to thank the club president, Scott Henderson, and everyone who was there on the night. Earlier in the year, the St George Touch Association had seven teams compete at the New South Wales Junior State Cup in Port Macquarie. It was really good to be able to acknowledge some of the players for their outstanding efforts last weekend. I'd like to congratulate Tara-Jade Ottman, Casey Cowgill, Alicia Langley, Orlando Garcia, Luke Tiberti, Brady Lauretti and Max Titley for all of their achievements. The St George Touch Association started in 2009. They have more than 450 participants across 50 teams at playing down at Peakhurst Park in my electorate. I really enjoyed attending the presentation night. Congratulations to everyone on a great season.</span>

There are currently over 100 active members in the group, being joeys, cubs, scouts, venturers and rovers. I'm very fortunate to have a very active Scouting community in the Banks electorate. We see the Scouts participating in so many community events—on Anzac Day, Clean Up Australia Day and so many other days—putting back into our community and providing an environment in which young kids can learn more about teamwork, their community and their innate abilities within themselves.

The Oatley Football Club is going exceptionally well, with around 700 members registered this year. It is one of the strongest clubs anywhere in the St George region. The Oatley Football Club's home ground is Renown Park. One of the issues down at Renown Park is that lighting could be better. Lighting needs to be improved. There is some lighting there at the moment, but it's not always adequate for games and for training. With so many players, it is important that the lighting is upgraded to meet Australian lux standards. I look forward to continuing to work with the club on that very important issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  Tuesday night's unfair budget confirmed where the government's priorities lie. The government will take an axe to Centrelink, while giving a cut of $80 billion to big business. The government will axe 1,280 staff from the Department of Human Services. Australians are finding it more and more difficult to contact and access Centrelink. Ask any Australian who has had to try to contact Centrelink to manage their payments or their applications for payment and they will tell you their personal nightmare. We have heard horror stories of people being forced to wait hours on the phone to speak to someone. We have heard stories about people who have waited weeks for their payments to be approved, sometimes even months. We have heard stories about thousands of people being issued with false or erroneous debt notices and being threatened with legal action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that Centrelink is understaffed and underresourced. Last year, the government cut 1,200 jobs from DHS, and unanswered calls to Centrelink doubled to 55 million and call wait times increased. The government then announced it would outsource 1,250 jobs to labour hire companies. The government is selling off Centrelink jobs to labour hire firms piece by piece. The government's announcement of $50 million to address the shocking call wait times is not new money. It is nothing more than a head fake of concern about call wait times. Centrelink need permanent staff. They need full-time staff who are properly equipped and trained to manage the complex issues facing income support recipients. The issues and circumstances confronting income support recipients are often complex, and Labor recognises this complexity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is only interested in demonising income support recipients. The goal is clear—to make it so difficult and so painful to access income support, people simply give up. At a time when we are hearing some horrendous examples of unethical behaviour within the government, and within the banks through the royal commission, on top of the 1,280 job cuts, the government will resume its pursuit of drug testing welfare participants, double down on robo-debt, begin police checks on income support recipients—I will speak more about that later today—and make it more difficult for Australians to contact Centrelink. Therefore, we are looking at a fundamentally unfair budget and a government that really is going to force people into homelessness and crime. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I rise to speak about our budget from Tuesday night and its effect on the people of my electorate of Hinkler. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may not know, but according to the Australian Local Government Association, the per capita income in the statistical area of Wide Bay is the lowest in the country, at just $34,000 per year. They and the people of my electorate—49,000 hardworking, taxpaying individuals—will receive tax relief up to the tune of $530 as a result of the budget on Tuesday night, and that is substantial to them. It will make a real difference to their lives and will be an economic boost for our local area. For those 36,000 individuals above the age of 65, our commitment to 20,000 additional packages for home care—6,000 from MYEFO and 14,000 on Tuesday night—will be a relief for them. For those who don't require that service yet but know they may in the future, for those who wish to stay in their own homes longer, this is very much needed support, and I'm very pleased it's being delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to those things already delivered in this term of government, we've had a discussion with the local mayor, Jack Dempsey, from Bundaberg Regional Council, whom I've known for some time. I'd say to the mayor that we have already delivered on our financial assistance grants promises—around $7 million per year on average. That is a cash and untied payment. There is $50 million to upgrade security at regional airports, which will include the Bundaberg Regional Council and Hervey Bay regional airports. There's a $250 million commitment for major projects business cases. We've had a lot of discussions about our local port, which is owned and operated by the Gladstone Ports Corporation, but expansions cost from $2 billion to $5 billion, and they can't be done on the back of a coaster. So this is a very important announcement to develop local business cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we delivered $2.9 million for the Burnett Heads town centre redevelopment; $6 million, in partnership with BRC and Pacific Tug, for an upgrade at the Bundaberg port; $5 million through BBRF for the multiplex expansion; $400,000 for Christsen Park; $1.4 million for Kay McDuff Drive; $3 million through Roads to Recovery for Eggmolesse Street upgrades; and $3.2 million for black spot safety upgrades. I say to the mayor, and to the councillors in particular, that when a cash grant arrives through the financial assistance grants, there is an opportunity to put some of that money back into our economy through a reduction in rates. If they could do that, that would be money for people who are in a very difficult position, whose average per capita income is just $34,000 a year. We've done our part—we've provided tax relief, which is much needed, with a very large injection into our local economy. I'd say to our regional councils that there is an opportunity here for you to reduce the cost of living. Use the cash grants to reduce the costs of rates to those individuals, who will be very much appreciative of it. I once again commend the budget. It's been a very good budget. I look forward to its implementation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  Shortly after I was first elected to parliament in September 2013, I stood in the House to speak about the deep concerns that I have about the live export industry. Since then, I've continued to speak out over further incidents of animal cruelty during live exports, of which there have been many in the five years that I've served in this parliament. I called on the industry to get its act together. I called on the minister for agriculture to do the same. But the animal cruelty has continued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The footage broadcast on <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> recently which showed the condition of sheep being transported on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> was shocking, and I think it's a turning point in this debate. To see sheep rotting in their own excrement, their bodies falling apart, and lambs being stuck in a bog, unable to get access to food and water and under clear and extreme distress, was like watching something out of a nightmare. We know that on that voyage more than 2,000 sheep died in transit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say that the voyage and the footage was shocking but, as many of my constituents have pointed out to me, was it really? We've known about the condition of sheep being transported to the Middle East for a long time. This debate has been going on since the 1980s, and it was in 2006 that former Prime Minister John Howard decided that he would suspend the trade because of these same animal welfare concerns. The breaches and the promises that things will be better have been constant. Yet in the five years I've been in parliament nothing much has changed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had enough, and my party has had enough. Live sheep exporters have been given every opportunity. They've been given every chance to fix their activities, and recent events have shown us the reality—that is, that it's not possible to fix it. The animal welfare issue at the heart of this trade is not one of regulation; it's the voyage itself. It's too far, it's too hot and it cannot be made humane for the animals being transported. So Labor is going to assist with the phasing out of this industry. We're going to do it in a planned and calm manner to ensure that people who depend on this industry have the opportunity to adjust. The live export industry has been given enough opportunities to stick to the rules but they have failed to stick to those rules so many times now. It's time to phase out this industry and shut it down, and that's what Labor will be doing when we're next in government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about the people who care about this issue, because I've heard people in this debate deride this issue as a concern of some kind of trendy leftie environmentalists, and that's absolutely not the case. I've had more than 1,000 of the people I represent email me about this issue. It matters to them a great deal. I have never been contacted by my constituents on any other matter with the form and volume of emails that have come to me on this question. I want to say to the people who wrote to me that this is your democracy at work. I've read your emails and I've heard your calls, and we've answered those calls by agreeing that we will phase out the industry, because animals cannot be protected through this voyage.</span>

We are very proud of our plan to deliver lower, fairer and simpler taxes to encourage and reward working Australians. For instance, a high school teacher in my electorate who is on $75,000 will have an extra $530 in his or her pocket from the budget year onwards, with an extra $3,740 in his or her pocket over the first seven years of the tax plan. We're backing business to invest and create jobs. We're guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely on. We're keeping Australians safe, and we're ensuring that government lives within its means.</span>

The total commitment for that is now $150 million, and we call desperately and urgently on the Labor government to match that funding, which is also a very important part of our city deal. We've provided $20 million for the construction of a new international terminal at Avalon Airport, Victoria's second international airport—such an exciting investment for our region and for the entire state. There's a new $45 million Tourism Infrastructure Fund, which presents some really significant opportunities for Corangamite and our Great Ocean Road region as part of the $200 million Building Better Regions Fund—again, great opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another round of the Stronger Communities Program will be provided—$3.5 billion over 10 years to deliver our roads of strategic importance, and that's a big focus on upgrading key freight corridors. There will be $1 billion for our urban congestion initiative over 10 years and, very importantly, a $250 million commitment to major project business cases, because we know that so often when it comes to developing new projects the feasibility work, the business planning work, needs to be done, and there is a funding gap, which has now been addressed in our budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also of course guaranteeing essential services on which Corangamite families rely by increasing total health and hospitals funding by 30 per cent, delivering a 50 per cent average increase per student in fair, real needs-based school funding over a decade and of course more childcare support to those families who really need it. I'm incredibly proud of the Turnbull government's 2018 budget, and I'm here to help my constituents in any way I can.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  One of the most rewarding parts of my job is spending time with young people in my electorate and talking with them about our democracy and the role that we can all play in creating change in our society. Unlike the popular stereotype, I usually find young people to be less cynical about the world and more optimistic about the potential for change in our country than the average person on the street. To this end, I recently had the privilege of hosting student leaders from schools across my electorate at my office for the first Gellibrand School Leaders Forum, a practical workshop on issues in our community and the role that young people can play in solving them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Participating schools were Sunshine Secondary College, Gilmore Girls College, Williamstown High, Emmanuel College, Mount St Joseph's Girls' College, Footscray City College and Bayside College. Some of the issues that students raised at this forum included the need to educate students about politics, inclusion, sustainability and waste management in our community, climate change, and the need for politicians to engage young people in our political process more effectively and creatively. The participants in the forum have all given me an action plan about the changes they want to make in their schools and communities and what they will do to make it happen. Their ideas include a youth town hall event in our community where young people can raise and debate issues in their communities; an engaging how-to guide that informs students about how they can engage with their local MP—that's me—and build confidence for them to engage with the political process more broadly; community composting initiatives in their schools and communities; and funding for community vegetable patches. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have given them a commitment to back them in and help them make their action plans a reality. I was impressed by their creativity and enthusiasm to solve issues in our broader community. We can all learn from their example, optimism and energy. I would like to thank the following students for participating in the forum: Hasnain Musharib, Angelique Corke-Cox, Sydneyrita Fatamala, BJ Falute, Elena Turner, Sara Coladonato, Cameron Palin, Jade Pedlar, Sarah Kassar, Manu Yu Chai, Charlie Vu, Joseph Siccita, Ashar Abdul-Gaffar, Christopher Koulis, Madeline Bateman, Amy Smedly, Alexandra Strangis, Hayley Cassidy, Toby Walker, Leela Grey, Ruby Goonan, Charlie Morrison and Lachlan Gregorio. It was an energising morning with these fantastic young Australian citizens, and it gave me great confidence in the future of our democracy. I'm looking forward to working with these young leaders to help solve the issues they have raised, to help their work in our community and to ensure that the next generation of young Australians feel that they have a stake in the future of our democracy. </span>

It was the third time in six years that the team has claimed this coveted trophy. My congratulations to this year's team: captain Aaron Macatta, Matthew Cramp, Cody McKinnon, Luke Virtue, Jye Wilson, Michael Blackler, Nick Albertini, Bryan McCalman, Wil Parsons, Dean Marshall, Simon Hore-Thorburn, Nathan McCann, Max Hospers, Matthew Parish, Jakeb Speers and Tyler Szczerbanik. A special mention goes to Oscar Stahl, who was named player of the match. The team was coached by Chris Hunt, the assistant coach was Darren Beardow and the manager was Nicholas Winkler-Maloney. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not to be outdone, the Thistles A-grade women's team also won the open-A Callan McMillan Shield on the same weekend. It's the first time in 22 years the team has won the trophy, and I'd like to congratulate the team: captain and player of the match Elsa Mangan, Claudia Hewett, Natalia Brooker, Sophie Norton, Dana Wilson, Keea Parish, Madison Fiedler, Caitlin Moss, Tahli Drew, Chelsea Mangan, Sarah Fairfull, Amy Fairfull and Zoe Skewes. They were coached by Paul Albertini with manager Harvey Wilson. The Thistles club also finished runner-up in the ANZAC Cup men's open A division. The other winners were the Alstonville Football Club, which took out the ANZAC Cup in the grade 16 division. In the women's Callan McMillan Memorial Shield the Casino RSM Cobras took out division B. Congratulations to them all. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge Football Far North Coast, which has been led for many years by Steve Mackney and his team Julie Clifford and Luke Mackney, who work tirelessly to advance the great game in our region. Numbers will go through 7,000 this year, which is a wonderful statistic. We have an international coaching centre in Lismore, and we've also produced some local icons such as a Socceroo, Craig Foster, and a Matilda, Lisa Casagrande. I'm looking forward to a great season.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank two men who saved the life of nine-year-old Robert Miller after he was recently dragged out by a rip at Pippi Beach in Yamba. Iraqi veteran Jake Scobie was visiting his mother, Gail, when he and a Dutch backpacker heard the screams of Robert's mother, Vivien, after a wave had dragged Robert out deeper and she could no longer see her son. Without a moment's hesitation the two men ran into the surf, reached Robert and were able to pull him back to safety. I thank them both.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I rise again to express concern at the lack of proper planning by the New South Wales government for the WestConnex project. This project has been characterised by bad planning and incompetence, and inferior and sometimes, quite frankly, misleading community consultation processes. Perhaps uniquely, it is a project in which they started building the tunnel without knowing where the tunnels would come up, something that will be studied by governments in future years. The bad planning was exemplified by the New South Wales Supreme Court's decision last week that the New South Wales state government's acquisition of property in the Rozelle goods yards was invalid. The Desane Group, whose property was located at 68-72 Lilyfield Road, had taken action. This is a massive blow to the state government. It undermines their future acquisition powers and shows that the government simply does not have its act together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It follows a series of debacles: the underpayment of residents who had their properties voluntarily or, in some cases, compulsorily acquired; changes to the route and to where the dive sites for the project would be, including the quite extraordinary proposal to have a dive site almost on the grounds of Sydney Secondary College Leichhardt Campus; changes to where the stacks are and a refusal to filter the stacks, unlike what the state government said about stacks for roads near schools on the north shore of Sydney, which should be filtered; and proposals to use parks or ovals for the project. Ashfield Park, Petersham Oval and Blackmore Oval have all been threatened at various times. Good infrastructure requires you to plan first, then get the financing, then start construction. This has happened in the opposite direction. The fact that Infrastructure Australia had this project on its priority list calls into question its processes as well, because it goes neither to the port nor to the airport, which were the objectives of this project.</span>

Recreational and community sport provides significant benefits by bringing people together and providing opportunities for social interaction, as well as having proven mental health benefits. I recognise outstanding sporting achievements and congratulate the many award winners across Chisholm in recent months. Chisholm was represented strongly at this year's Commonwealth Games. I congratulate Tim Disken, an alumnus of PLC's Aquatic Centre and great Aussie Paralympian, on winning gold in the 100 metre freestyle. I also congratulate Waverley Gymnastics Centre's Emily Whitehead on winning the bronze medal in the gymnastics vault. A big congratulations go to the Box Hill under-14 girls cricket team for the outstanding achievement of a perfect season, finishing undefeated and winning the premiership—a rare feat in and of itself, and the girls were successful in an all-boys league. I'd like to acknowledge the coach, Nicholas Fletcher; the captain, Stella Reid; Heidi Pearce; Eliza O'Neill; Rylie Wilcox; Bridie Garlick; Alexandra Elliot; Harriet Smolarek; Airiarn Stewart; Kate Roberts; Lucy Shuttleworth; Iona Cameron; Ruby Cullinan; and Charlotte Hodgson.</span>

I am very proud to have delivered on my election commitment to have provided $890,000 in funding for the Waverley District Netball Association's new courts and facilities in Ashwood, providing the 4,000 players who use the courts regularly and residents in my electorate of Chisholm with a much safer place to play and train.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago I had the privilege of attending the Bennettswood Bowls Club, at their presentation day and afternoon tea. This was a great opportunity to mingle with the wonderful people at the Bennettswood Bowls Club and to recognise outstanding performances and contributions in the club. Congratulations to Ian Crawford and his committee and to the many winners, including Chisholm residents Adam Wreford, Ray Camm, Michael Robotham, John Young, Vic Samarias, Ian McGeachin, Brian Peake and Peter Herring. I also visited another fantastic bowls club recently, the Mount Waverley Bowling Club. Thank you to Richard Sluggett and all of the team for their great work in the community—and for even giving me a lawn bowls lesson whilst I was wearing high heels!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Stronger Communities Program grants, I'm pleased to have delivered funding to many fantastic local sporting clubs, including the Box Hill United Pythagoras Soccer Club, Kerrimuir United Cricket Club, Eastern Lions Soccer Club, Ashwood Sports Club, North Box Hill Tennis Club and Nunawading Basketball. Sporting clubs are the heart and soul of many Australian communities, particularly in my electorate of Chisholm. That's why the Turnbull government is backing community sport, providing $29.7 million in infrastructure grants for local sporting clubs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  It is with great pleasure that I rise today. I received this text message from my indomitable staff member Margaret, in my Perth office, in northern Tasmania yesterday. I'll read it out, with your indulgence:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Centrelink seems to be getting swamped with age pension claims. Any one would think it has a lot to do with baby boomers retiring. The government has been aware of how many baby boomers would be retiring and should have taken staffing requirements to process claims into account. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This text gave me pause to think, what's happening with age pensioners in this country? How do we treat age pensioners? We know how this government treats age pensioners. The government has still got a $14 per fortnight energy supplement cut in its budget for pensioners, carers and people struggling on Newstart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals can't afford $14 per fortnight for pensioners, but they can afford $17 billion to reward banks that rip off customers, forge signatures and charge fees to dead people. There's no $14 for pensioners, but there's $17 billion for banks. It's a direct transfer of wealth and income from the poorest people in our community to some of the wealthiest corporations. That's an outrage.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes to our values and priorities as a country. We know the Liberals are all about looking after people who already have money. They think the more money that rich people have, the better off the rest of us will be. The formula has never worked throughout history, but they stick with it. Labor believes in looking after people, full stop. We know that providing the framework for a fair and decent society offers the best future for us all, and I know that's what the Leader of the Opposition will be talking about in this budget reply speech tonight. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people, like the Liberals, believe that the country should be run like a business: cut your costs, do everything as cheaply as possible and pay the workforce as little as you can legally get away with—it's all about profit and loss. I believe the country should be run like a family. Families still have to stick to a budget and they still have to live within their means, but there's a different type of thinking going on. You think about what's best for the people you love and care about, not about the least you can get away with. You want your family to live in a nice place and, importantly, you look after grandma—not because you have to but because you want to and because you respect the role that she has played in your life, allowing you to get to where you are in society.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report on the issue of foreign donations and the protection of our democratic integrity has received a high level of attention by the media and many stakeholder groups since this matter was first announced by the Turnbull government. The report deals with very difficult and important matters forming part of a complicated bill, and I'll briefly go through these matters. These include limiting or capping donations and expenditure, more or less public funding, reducing the disclosure threshold, real-time disclosure of donations, the regulation of third-party campaigners, charities receiving income from overseas, banning donations from types of classes of donors and increasing penalties for breaching the rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After considering many submissions and listening to feedback and evidence from stakeholder groups, it's clear that there are fundamental flaws in this legislation. This is outlined in the list of recommendations, which show just how unworkable the legislation would have been regardless of what the government tried to say. On the other hand, I'm very proud to say that for more than 10 years the Australian Labor Party has put forward a considered package of proposals to advance this debate, rather than the encompassing one-size-fits-all approach that the government wanted to take. I know this because my Labor colleagues recognise that these types of reforms must be a matter upon which the parties can reach substantial agreement. We have been trying to reach that agreement for some time, and I'm pleased to say that this report gives further avenues as to how this might be achieved. Consensus on this matter cannot come for the sake of some narrow political advantage or attempting, in an unfair way, to regulate some groups within civil society in a way that clearly seems designed to regulate them, in my opinion, out of existence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong democracy requires a strong civil society. When we talk about a level playing field in politics, in political speech and in political donations, we have to recognise that a level playing field treats stakeholders appropriately and not as if they are all exactly the same with the same interests. Under the current proposal, this is what the government seeks to impose. As we debate this, and if the government brings the legislation back on, we also have to recognise that we all have a great duty to all of our constituents to raise the standards of political disclosure and to build trust in our political institutions. This requires us to look at the influence of money on politics and to provide for much, much greater transparency. As I mentioned, the Labor Party has, for some time, set out a series of propositions which would go a long way towards this and, I hope, would contribute to further debates on this sensitive and important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than attempting to silence those we disagree with through legislation, we should be legislating and debating the real issues that the Australian people have charged us with. Whether it's proper funding for our schools and hospitals, a decent wage for a decent job or building appropriate infrastructure for the 21st century, we need to make sure that everyone has a say in the future of our country and not silence those who may speak out against us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that this is substantially a consensus report. In speaking today I also want to place on record that there is a lot more work to be done. My Labor colleagues and I stand ready to work with the government and with the Greens and other crossbenchers on advancing donation reform, noting that this report deals with a package of legislative proposals that don't and can't constitute the whole of this debate. As I said, there is much more to be done, and I am looking forward to playing a constructive role as part of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the hard work of the chair, Senator Reynolds, and, in particular, the deputy chair, the member for Scullin, along with Senator Brown and Senator Ketter, who have all made important contributions. The report now lays the foundation for further debate and consideration of this important topic. As I mentioned, my Labor colleagues and I stand ready to work with all parties to advance this matter, and I look forward to more constructive work yet to come between the parties.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  At the completion of this speech, I'll be heading to the launch of the Labor women's budget statement. One of the key areas of policy leadership is in our commitment to support victims of domestic and family violence. We all know about the harm caused by domestic and family violence around Australia and we all know the horrific statistics. It never gets any easier to read them out, but I think it's important to remind people that, in 2017 alone, 45 women were killed through domestic violence. It is the leading cause of death, disability and illness among women 15 to 44 years of age. One in six women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a cohabiting partner since the age of 15, and on average one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner. And we know that men can also be the victims of domestic and family violence. In the Northern Territory, between 2010 and 2014, nine per cent of all Territorians were victims of domestic violence. We have a serious problem in the Territory with domestic violence. Nine out of 10 of those people were Aboriginal, with Aboriginal women the victims in eight out of 10 cases. Obviously more needs to be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with Anna Davis and Rachael Uebergang from the NT Working Women's Centre and got an update on the important work that they are doing for women in the Territory. I've also spoken with other organisations, such as the YMCA and the YWCA, about the services that they provide to all victims of domestic and family violence. The Working Women's Centre stressed the importance of not only legislating paid domestic violence leave but also equipping employers with the knowledge and capacity to properly support employees experiencing domestic or family violence, as in some cases employers have been found to inadvertently and unintentionally compound their employees' suffering during these most difficult of times. The Working Women's Centre made the important point that, while workplace policies cannot solve domestic violence, employers have an important role in mitigating the harm and should know their policies and be able to implement them effectively. There is a gap in resources to support workplaces introducing domestic and family violence leave and to help employers to implement their policies. They suggested that the reintroduction of the Safe at Home, Safe at Work program could be part of the solution, and I think it is a suggestion that should be explored further. After all, apart from being a social issue, family violence is an industrial issue, which in four years time could cost the Australian economy an estimated $15.6 billion per year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note the government's efforts in combating family violence, and I will support any worthy initiative. However, their commitment to just 40 hours of unpaid leave is simply not enough. I can say with confidence that the electorate I represent, Solomon, which is Darwin and Palmerston, was pleased to hear that a Shorten-Plibersek Labor government would legislate 10 days of paid domestic and family violence leave in the National Employment Standards. This leave can provide valuable time for victims to seek legal advice, access counselling services and access medical treatment, without compounding a victim's fear of losing employment or valuable income that they need, regardless of whether they are a man or a woman. They need that valuable income to support themselves and their families. This should not be seen as a cost on business or an additional burden for employers. For businesses, including additional domestic violence leave as a workplace right will prevent loss of productivity, will increase employee retention and will reduce unpredictable absenteeism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also committed to reforming the Family Law Act 1975 to prevent victims of domestic violence being cross-examined in court by their abusers. The fact that in 2018 a perpetrator of domestic violence can subject their victim to hostile questioning in a courtroom is a disgrace. Labor has committed to providing $88 million over two years for a new safe housing fund to increase transitional housing options for vulnerable people escaping domestic and family violence. We must all stand up against domestic and family violence. It's an issue that affects us all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  What a great budget and what a great spend on infrastructure. How pleased I am that the government has decided on investing $160 million to co-partner with the new Marshall state government in an 80-20 deal to build a second crossing at Port Augusta, a duplication of the Joy Baluch Bridge. Post Augusta is the crossroads of the nation. If you're travelling from Sydney or Melbourne to Perth, you're travelling through Port Augusta. If you're travelling from Melbourne to Darwin, you're travelling through Port Augusta. If you're travelling from Adelaide to Darwin, you're travelling through Port Augusta. If you travel through Port Augusta, you have to cross the top of Spencer's Gulf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one crossing at Port Augusta. It is called the Joy Baluch Bridge, and it was built in 1972. If the Joy Baluch Bridge is interrupted—if its flow is interrupted or if we have an accident on board—then the traffic is diverted 30 kilometres to the north to go around the top of Spencer's Gulf. That's a dirt road. If it rains more than 10 millimetres, that road is out of order. All the emergency services in Port Augusta sit on the east side. There is a significant population on the west side. In the event the bridge is interrupted and the crossing is out, the nearest fire truck is in Whyalla, which is almost 100 kilometres away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a problem that has existed for some years and, as the traffic load is building on the bridge, things are getting worse. The bridge, as I said, was built in 1972. Around 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles a day are carted across the bridge. In 1972, when it was built to the design standards of the day, a walkway was put on the bridge. Unfortunately, it's only about 1.76 metres wide. There are some posts on the edge of the walkway, and there is no divider between it and the heavy traffic that travels across the bridge. By and large, it has been shunned by pedestrian traffic, bike riders and whatever. Over the years they have crossed the gulf on what is the old Great Western Bridge, which was built back in 1928. It's a wooden bridge. It looks more like a jetty than a bridge, quite frankly. It has served very well. It's a good way to get across the gulf. But little over 12 months ago it fell into disrepair and was then condemned and closed. That foot traffic was then put back on the Joy Baluch Bridge. It has been a very dangerous situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Originally, the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure reduced the speed limit on the bridge to 25 kilometres per hour and now 40 kilometres per hour. Schools are bussing children across the bridge because they are not happy for them to cross it on foot. We need an answer. We requested support from the previous state administration. For over 12 months, they would not supply an engineering report for that particular bridge. I've been lobbying hard with the Prime Minister, the urban infrastructure minister and the transport minister. Indeed, I had Minister Chester on the bridge back late last year. We need a solution, so I'm so pleased that we've announced $160 million to partner with the state's $40 million to address this very real issue. This bridge is going to get busier. We've got a mine starting just to the north at Carrapateena. There are 1,000 jobs going on there. Roxby Downs is now ramping up production. Traffic loads are going to continue to increase. It's the right answer, and I'm very pleased that we've been able to afford that partnership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's going to take some time, and I'm asking the Port Augusta citizens to be patient. There's been no work at all done on the engineering requirements of this bridge. We don't know exactly where it'll go yet. We've got a fair idea, where you'd think it would go, but that hasn't been decided. Consequently, we don't know what the bridge has to look like in an engineering sense. And then we will have to work out exactly what capability we want on the bridge. Once we get to that stage we'll have in-depth design analysis—proper engineering designs for the bridge—and then we'll have to start negotiating with the people who are likely to lose their houses, likely to lose their businesses. As I said, they don't know exactly where the bridge is going. It will be a mammoth project and it will be very disruptive, but it is the solution for Port Augusta and for the nation. It will also involve dealing with the EPA and the Coastal Protection Board, and native title clearances. Don't expect this bridge to be finished by the end of next week. I guess I'm trying to put a sense of reality about what needs to be dealt with here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget shows $60 million through the forward estimates, because Treasury's best guess is that the project will take longer than that. There's a bit of a scare campaign going on on the ground back home, I must say, but they can rest assured that the rest of the coverage on the bridge is in the forward projections. The $160 million will be delivered in full and we'll get the project going as soon as we possibly can.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Denison</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  The community is well and truly sick to death of the inaction over live animal exports. What we saw a few weeks ago on <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> was just another episode of many episodes. It was not an isolated incident. That shocking footage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span>, a vessel on which over 2,000 sheep died on one voyage alone, was dreadful in itself, but it was not an isolated incident. In fact, when you add it to a whole lot of other incidents over many, many years, you see that we have a systemic problem here. We've seen exposes and we've heard reports from vessels and from destination countries as diverse as China and Vietnam and repeated exposes of animal cruelty in Indonesia. We saw that footage of Australian sheep being buried alive in Pakistan. We've had the repeated exposes out of a number of countries in the Middle East, including Israel and up in Turkey. We have a systemic problem, and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> was not an isolated incident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need action. We do not need another inquiry, and we certainly do not need an inquiry headed by Dr Michael McCarthy, because he's an industry insider. He has worked for Emmanuel. He's worked for Wellard. He's worked for a number of the big companies and stakeholders in the live animal export trade. I'm not saying that Dr McCarthy is not a good person, but how a government could think it's appropriate to have an industry insider head an inquiry beggars belief. We do not need a tinkering with the current arrangements, a tinkering with the regulations—a bit more oversight; slightly reduce the number of sheep on any one vessel. The fact is that the cruelty and the problems are so systemic, that the only way to end the cruelty is to end the trade. That's what the community is looking for. The community is looking to this government to finally be the government that will put an end to the live animal export trade and in particular to the trade in live sheep to the Middle East, most of whom go across the equator and go into the Middle East at the height of a northern summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the community's looking for: to end the trade. And we want to put an end to these ridiculous excuses we hear—this excuse that people in the Middle East will buy only live sheep. What nonsense! The Middle East market already buys over $600 million of processed sheepmeat a year from Australia—frozen and chilled meat—compared with only $250 million of live sheep. They already buy processed meat. They will buy more processed meat if we stop the export of live sheep. And what about this nonsense that people in the Middle East don't have refrigerators? What a racist comment. Of course they've got refrigerators. Where do we think they're putting the $600 million of frozen and chilled meat that we're sending already?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there is this excuse that their religion requires them to have live sheep from Australia. What nonsense! So many of our abattoirs in Australia are already halal certified, and they're the abattoirs that are already supplying that over $600 million a year of processed sheep meat. Then there is the nonsense that we need to do this to supply protein to the world's disadvantaged. What rot! This is not a humanitarian operation; this is business. The only reason we're shipping hundreds of thousands of sheep to the Middle East and other animals to other parts of the world is to make money. It's not about supplying protein. It's not a humanitarian mission. It's about money. What about the nonsense that if we don't send sheep to the Middle East, someone else will? That's the old drug dealer's defence. We have a moral responsibility to do the right thing and what some people do in other countries is their business. It's nonsense that we don't have enough abattoirs. We have a huge surge capacity in existing Australian abattoirs, and any sort of transition period over maybe a couple of years to wind the trade up would provide more than enough time for existing abattoirs to expand and even new abattoirs to be built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the nonsense that we can't shut down the trade because people will be out of work. The fact is that a darn sight more people have been forced out of work in recent years because of the expansion of the live animal export trade and the fact that it's taken work from Australian abattoirs. The fact is that the live animal export trade, in particular the export of live sheep to the Middle East, is systemically cruel. It's not in Australia's economic self-interest and it doesn't have popular support. The only way to end the cruelty and meet the expectations of the community is to shut down the trade.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I'm pleased to inform the Chamber and my community on the northern Gold Coast that the Turnbull government has delivered in this budget for those living on the Gold Coast. This is a budget that takes care of our senior citizens and retirees. It's a budget that supports and helps families. This is a budget that provides essential services that northern Gold Coasters need and, indeed, rely upon. Importantly, this is a budget that is backing working Australians. We're backing the honest and hardworking men and women in my electorate of the northern Gold Coast by providing responsible tax relief, starting in just 7½ weeks, from 1 July this year, focusing on middle- and low-income earners. We are lifting tax brackets over time to ensure wages don't get eaten up by higher taxes. We're making sure that those who work hard, over time, don't lose out. This is a seven-year personal tax plan. This is your seven-year tax plan. We're awarding Australians, you, who earn a promotion or strive for a better-paying job, by reducing the amount of tax you pay so you can take more home. In my electorate, 73,000 taxpayers in the northern Gold Coast will benefit from the low- to middle-income tax relief starting from 1 July this year. Seven out of every 10 working Gold Coasters are getting tax relief. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't emphasise enough how important this is for my community. A high school teacher on $75,000 in the northern Gold Coast will have an extra $530 in their pocket from this year's budget onwards. That is an extra $3,740 in their pocket over the seven years of their personal income tax reduction plan. A workshop manager in Fadden on $88,000 will have $575 extra in their pocket and over $4,000 returned to them in tax relief as part of their personal tax reduction plan. A shop assistant on $45,000 in the northern Gold Coast will have an extra $440 in their pocket and an extra $3,380 over the life of their seven-year personal reduction plan. A hairdresser earning $50,000 in the northern Gold Coast will have an extra $530 in their pocket and $3,740 over the next seven years as part of their seven-year personal tax reduction plan. Someone working in fast food on $42,000 will have an extra $530 in their pocket and $3,020 over the life of their seven-year personal tax reduction plan. An accountant on $87,000 will have an extra $530 in their pocket and $3,740 over the next seven years as part of their personal tax reduction plan. Eight out of 10 of the northern Gold Coasters will have reduced tax. This is a red-letter day. This is good stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just about tax relief; there's so much more for my electorate and for the hardworking mums and dads on the Gold Coast. We know how important child care is. On the northern Gold Coast, as of 2 July our new child care system will be in place and 8,739 local families in my electorate will benefit from those reforms. Almost 10 per cent of the families on the northern Gold Coast will benefit because of what the government's doing. The National Energy Guarantee will ensure Australians and businesses can have affordable and reliable energy. People in my community—everyone—will receive relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget is also evidence of how we're building a stronger economy. Some 21,000 local businesses in the northern Gold Coast with turnovers of up to $50 million if they're incorporated and up to $5 million if unincorporated, will receive some support. The budget extends the popular instant asset write-off for small businesses for a further 12 months, so they can instantly write-off assets up to $20,000. Thousands of the local businesses in my community will benefit. There's a billion dollars for the M1 on the table that, of course, is waiting for Labor state government to stump up their half so we can complete the most important interconnector in our country—that between the Gold Coast and Brisbane. This road was started by then Premier Borbidge over 20 years ago. We can end it now with a billion dollars on the table. There's $140 billion over the next four years for the film industry to take the location offset to some $77 million per annum, which will see thousands and thousands of Gold Coasters employed and over 6,000 businesses benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an extraordinary budget for the Gold Coast—one of the best budgets I've seen in a decade. I'm looking forward to supporting it strongly on the floor of the House, as I support you in my electorate strongly in what you do every day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ECV" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAYES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  The 30th of April is a date that is very significant not only for millions of Vietnamese people around the world but also for many Australians, including myself, who have witnessed the extraordinary contribution the Vietnamese have made to our nation. This year, 30 April marked the 43rd anniversary of the fall of Saigon—43 years since many South Vietnamese lost homes, family and friends; 43 years since they lost their freedom and their country. After the fall of Saigon, many Vietnamese families fled, seeking a new life based on freedom and dignity. In just over four decades, the Vietnamese community in Australia have overcome their collective trauma of the past and have flourished remarkably to become one of the most successful refugee stories in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this year, I was not able to join the many hundreds of Australian Vietnamese at the Australian War Memorial to commemorate the fall of Saigon as I was in Turkey having attended the Anzac Day ceremonies in Gallipoli. On 30 April each year, the Australian Vietnamese community come together to pay respects to family and friends they've lost, to honour the courage and sacrifice of the many Australian and Vietnamese soldiers who served and died defending South Vietnam, and to pray for the many hundreds of thousands of people who died in the jungles and at sea, fleeing tyranny in search of freedom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 30th of April is also an opportunity for the wider Australian community to reflect upon the extraordinary contribution the Vietnamese people have made to our nation. The Vietnamese have played such an important role in shaping our diverse, multicultural and democratic society. I'm not sure it's fully understood, but they are always the first to lend a helping hand in times of natural disasters, such as floods and bushfires. Incredibly, in response to an international appeal in 2016, the Vietnamese community raised more than half a million dollars in support of the UN's efforts for refugees of the Middle East crisis and, in particular, from Syria. Their resilience and hard work, their willingness to give back and their very generous nature, particularly for Australians in need, truly display the great Australian spirit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The anniversary of the fall of Saigon is also an opportunity to draw on the ongoing human rights violations occurring in Vietnam. Vietnam continues to be ruled by a Communist government that's intolerant of dissent. It's a government that has a strong track record of silencing critics and suppressing any attempts by its people to advocate human rights and promote democracy. At the beginning of April, prominent human rights lawyer Nguyen Van Dai, as well as five other activists, were sentenced to a combined total of 66 years in prison under vague human rights laws because of their efforts to promote the building of a democratic, progressive, civilised and just society in Vietnam. Human Rights Watch have called for the Vietnamese government to drop charges against these peaceful campaigners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Nations has criticised Vietnam for human rights violations and for preventing citizens from exercising their basic human rights of freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly. Amnesty International and many other human rights organisations have called on Vietnam to release all political prisoners and provide a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders, as well as honouring their international human rights obligations. Vietnam is a significant player in a strong, emerging regional economy and now holds a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council, so we should reasonably expect Vietnam to recognise the human rights, dignity and liberty of its people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very honoured to represent the largest Vietnamese community in Australia. While they have readily shared their vibrant culture and traditions with the wider community, they have never forgotten their history and their passionate belief in freedom and respect for all. I will continue to stand by my Vietnamese friends, who strive for freedom, democracy and respect for human rights.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  It's not often that you have the opportunity to put on record a great delivery for the electorate that you represent; however, this is just such an occasion. The budget of 2018, due to good economic management and taking strong but sometimes hard decisions, has helped deliver the new Shoalhaven River bridge, an infrastructure investment of $155 million, following the initial $10 million from the federal government, part of my commitment in the 2013 election. Just over 12 months ago I turned the first sod for the mental health research and lifeline hub, MIND the GaP, on UOW Shoalhaven Campus. In July we'll open this great investment of more than $1.2 million, co-funded by the university. There was an extended wait time while an environmental consideration of a not-so-rare orchid destroyed the dream of allocating a federal government co-funded investment of $9.5 million into a motorsports complex at Yerriyong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my Labor neighbour for asking the minister for infrastructure to keep the investment in Gilmore. This delivered a number of essential projects that were in dire need of government investment for the communities in three local government areas of the electorate. In Eurobodalla the disability sector was the winner, with just under $2 million in total to complete stage 2 of three different sites: the disability respite centre being constructed by Yumaro, the additional consulting and specialist room for Muddy Puddles, and the final stage of the fully inclusive playground at Corrigan's Reserve. In Shoalhaven it was the youth and veterans where investment was needed: $600,00 to complete the Voyager Memorial Park upgrades, $1.9 million to complete the Dunn Lewis Centre, a youth hub in Ulladulla. The council-funded new basketball and sports stadium in Bombaderry had a shortfall of $2.8 million for the fit-out to build the bleachers, bathrooms, kitchens and floors. It would only have been built to lock-up otherwise. South Coast Dairy is also now able to start manufacturing butter. In the Kiama municipality the aged-care facility had almost $2.4 million allocated for its meeting hall and small spaces facility on the old hospital site to help with the investment of this great project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election we committed to deliver a $20 million investment to create jobs and increase business opportunity. There was a very competitive round of great applications, and these were reviewed by a committee in line with the strategic development guidelines complied by the RDA and approved by the department. The successful projects included the following. Shoalhaven Starches received funding to increase flour milling production and distribution. Cottee Jersey Group were allocated $2.8 million for the installation of a dairy processing plant to double jobs and productivity. Eurobodalla shire will be getting a massive, wonderful oyster and shellfish hatchery. A brand-new community hub with family space and training facilities will built by CareSouth. Cupitt's Winery will be building more accommodation and kitchen amenities with their $1.5 million investment. Milton District Meats can grow with a new chiller and boning room using their $1.1 million. More health bars and healthy beverages will be manufactured by Essence Group. Ultimate Campers will be able to build their brand-new camper line using their investment. Shoalhaven City Council can get their new floating pontoon system at Greenwell Point for all the boaties out there. Friends of The Eurobodalla Regional Botanic Garden will be constructing a community space and expanding their plant species centre. Mussel lines and spats in Jervis Bay can go ahead, with South Coast Mariculture gaining funding. Venus Shell Systems, with Pia Winberg's investment, time and energy, will be steaming ahead with their seaweed production. Partech Systems will be getting into their automated test systems. T&amp;A Consulting will be co-investing for their freshwater aquaculture. Sea Breeze Aviation will expand facilities in their flying school, which is bringing in massive numbers of young people from overseas. Shoalhaven City Council will be building a boat maintenance facility at Woollamia. Climax Air Conditioning will be getting new upgrades for their vehicles. Nowra Chemical Manufacturers will be getting more temperature-controlled tanks for their beautiful, green-produced cosmetics which are going all over the world. Silos Estate is putting in an electric vehicle charger as a base for tourism. Stormtech is going to be getting a new stainless steel manufacturing site. There are just so many things happening, and a thousand jobs will be created in our region because of this very strategic investment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank our local RJIP committee for reviewing the applications, because they know how important this investment is. I also want to thank all the businesses who had the confidence to apply and invest in their operations, to grow in our region and to create jobs for our mature people and our youth. Even the butter manufacturing is going to employ people with a disability. I'm so proud of them all.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the National Mental Health Commission's Review of Mental Health Programs and Services, the Government is working across portfolios to join up child and youth mental health programs to improve mental health outcomes for children and young people, commencing with the early years and going through to adolescence. From August 2018, beyondblue will deliver a single integrated end to end school based mental health program which will support promotion and prevention activity and help to build resilience skills within children and young people.</span>

This initiative particularly supports providers working with children who would benefit from early intervention, including those who have experienced trauma, and will support professionals in working with parents and families of these children.</span>
