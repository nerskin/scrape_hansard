I think that was a sensible proposition, which we were happy to accept, and between that offer and 9.30, I understand, the whips have been contacting the Greens and the crossbenchers to indicate this change in plan.</span>

We knew that there was a great deal of interest in this bill because of the importance of the money flowing through to the local governments. They have expressed their interest in that. We also know that there were many speakers who wanted to be part of this debate, so it is important that we go through that.</span>

We acknowledge the pressure that has been put on by community members to ensure that we consider this bill and put it through quickly so that the House can consider it and we can look at what we can do with the process.</span>

There is no reason why that could not have happened. As to giving up private members' time, we have fought so hard in this Senate to have private members' time, for the opposition parties and the crossbench, for years. And to see a debacle like this shows exactly what this Senate is going to be subjected to if people do not get their act together.</span>

And I do share the concerns of the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Milne, in relation to private members' time—it has been hard fought for. I think there are broader issues about question time as well. With a record number of crossbenchers, we need to have a fairer system in place so that crossbenchers can fairly participate in the debates in this chamber and the processes of this chamber, including question time and private members' time. I look forward to discussing that with my colleagues and with the whips of the major parties as well, so that we can head off some of the problems that are emerging.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, I indicate my support for this bill. I will also be supporting the amendments proposed by both the Australian Greens and the opposition, in the sense that they are relatively similar and I believe either option will be an improvement to this bill. In particular, I want to express my support for the amendments proposing greater scrutiny of projects over a certain monetary threshold. I believe this is an important amendment and will help to ensure accountability and transparency. I also want to acknowledge the good work that the infrastructure assistant minister, the Hon. Jamie Briggs, has done. I think that what he has said about ensuring value for money on road projects is refreshing; I think that that is actually a good initiative on his part and, if he is successful, as I hope he will be, in improving the processes and the value-for-money criteria, then he will be doing this country a great service. But I also think that having greater accountability and transparency in respect of road funding is a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will keep my remarks brief because time is of the essence when it comes to this bill. It has already been delayed, which is of significant concern to local councils, and further delays could jeopardise funding for vital projects, particularly in respect of Roads to Recovery. I acknowledge the many, many phone calls and text messages I have exchanged with Felicity-ann Lewis, the President of the Australian Local Government Association, from South Australia, who is doing a great job. I pay tribute to her persistence, to her interest and to her advocacy in respect of this issue on behalf of local government. I think all of my colleagues in this place are supportive of the Roads to Recovery program and want to see it extended, given that the previous funding ended in June and that some councils have begun new projects based on promises that the funding would continue. We must ensure this legislation passes as a matter of urgency. However, I do want to address a fundamental inequality in the way that funds are allocated. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australian local government currently manages 11 per cent, or 75,000 kilometres, of the nation's local road network and receives just 5.5 per cent of identified local roads grant funding, despite the fact that South Australia has about 7.2 per cent of the nation's population. As such, South Australia receives the lowest funding per capita of all states and territories, at just $23.23 per capita. South Australia also has the lowest funding spent per kilometre, with Queensland and Western Australia receiving almost twice as much. Victoria receives 2.25 times as much funding. New South Wales gets nearly three times as much. By contrast, Tasmania, which has about two per cent of Australia's population, receives $72.40 per capita, over five times the funding to South Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To address this inequality, the supplementary local road fund was established; but, despite the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program, this supplementary account, which would have brought South Australia up to 7.9 per cent of the fund—an improvement but still not quite good enough—has not been included in the current budget, and that is fundamentally wrong. I urge the Hon. Jamie Briggs, the assistant minister for infrastructure, and the Hon. Christopher Pyne, the most senior South Australian in the cabinet, to fight for South Australia in the same way that Nick Minchin, Alexander Downer and Amanda Vanstone fought for South Australia when they were in the cabinet. I just hope that they have the same level of resolve when it comes to their home state of South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this means is that South Australian councils will miss out on about $18 million for 2014-15, with some individual councils missing out on as much as $1 million each. So, while I support this bill, I call on the government to renew their commitment to infrastructure by reinstating the supplementary fund or at least by reallocating the existing funds on a more equitable basis. Improving Australia's roads needs a national approach, and funding should be fairly distributed across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I support this bill. I look forward to debating the amendments in the committee stage but I want to make it clear that, whilst I support the opposition's and the Greens' amendments in terms of improving transparency and accountability, I do not want to see this bill ultimately delayed; I want to make sure that the funding for the Roads to Recovery program is flowing by next week. We cannot afford to have gridlock on a program that is obviously urgent, a program that both sides, both major parties, support. If we do not get the funding flowing by next week, then we are showing signs of that malaise, that gridlock, which has been so toxic in American politics. Let us not bring that to our shores.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="00AON" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator JOHNSTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  I thank all senators for their contributions on this important piece of legislation, the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, particularly Senator Xenophon. The government are committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century, and the changes in the bill will help us achieve the recently announced budget infrastructure initiatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 are sensible and necessary to facilitate the government's ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda. The bill provides funding certainty—funding that is critical to local government by continuing the vitally important Roads to Recovery program. The Roads to Recovery program, as many of us here know, lapsed on 30 June 2014. No payments can be made to local governments until this bill has passed, although we have committed $2.1 billion over the next five years to the program, including a doubling of funding to each and every council in the 2015-16 financial year. That is what is at stake with this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current nation building act, established by the former minister, Mr Anthony Albanese, made no provision for the Roads to Recovery program to continue beyond 30 June. The shadow spokesperson for infrastructure claims to be committed to local government and to this program, but he has failed local government by failing to provide for this vital program to continue on his watch. Without the passage of this bill, local councils stand to lose the $2.1 billion that I referred to in funding for this vital Roads to Recovery program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition spared no time in criticising the government's decision to pause the indexation of Financial Assistance Grants to local government for three years to help bring the budget back to surplus. This was a decision not taken lightly by the government. It is no secret that everyone is contributing to fix the economic mess left by the previous, Labor government. Australia's debt is already costing us billions of dollars in interest payments. This year alone, we are paying $12 billion in interest costs. Wouldn't it be nice if this could go to local councils as more funding through Financial Assistance Grants or to the Roads to Recovery program? But it cannot—a lost opportunity because of the reckless mismanagement by those opposite. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor failed to come clean with councils about their own agenda to block the flow of the $2.1 billion that I mentioned to local councils for the upkeep of their local roads—money that local councils completely rely upon. If the opposition were serious about local council funding, they would not have voted against this bill in the House of Representatives. I say that again for the benefit of those listening to us: if Labor were serious and honest with the Australian public, they would not have voted against the bill in the House of Representatives, which is what they did.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the winter recess we saw Labor claim that this program has been held up by the government's actions. But both Labor and their allies the Greens are yet to support the bill. In fact, as I have said, they voted against it in the House of Representatives yet were unable to point to one single element of the bill that, in their view, was unacceptable. It was just plain old deliberate obstructionism. They were playing politics—and they continue to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary intent of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is to continue the Roads to Recovery program—which Mr Albanese failed to provide for when he was the minister, creating an expiration date of 30 June 2014. That is why we are in the problem we are in. Mr Albanese proposes a private member's bill to fix the problem. Let us not forget that the shadow spokesperson is on record as saying legislation is not needed for the program. This private member's bill, which the government has not yet seen or been consulted on, is a media stunt to respond to the outrage expressed by local councils right across Australia. Again, this is clear evidence that the Labor Party are just plain playing politics. We know it is a media stunt because Mr Albanese attempted to suspend standing orders in the House on Tuesday to introduce a bill but actually had no paperwork to back it up. The Australian public, local councils and this Senate chamber have now seen exactly what he stands for—legislation by media release and nothing more. He made Labor vote against the bill in the House, and local councils around Australia were understandably outraged. The only way the Labor Party and the shadow minister can save any face is to talk of introducing his own legislation to save the program. If he now accepts that legislation is necessary, he should quit the theatrics and the politicking and support the government's legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has also been claiming that the bill contains amendments that are unacceptable to the opposition. Yet the main purpose of the bill is to continue the Roads to Recovery program—the bill that they themselves voted against in the House without being able to point to one single clause, paragraph or enactment of a bill that is now described as unacceptable. The bill also changes the name of the act to remove the politicisation of the Infrastructure Investment Program from within the act. Mr Albanese seems desperate to preserve his legacy and is playing a childish tactic of attempting to ensure that the name 'Nation Building Program', which he gave to this act, is retained. What he is doing right now, with roads running into disrepair, is the complete opposite of what he wants to call the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also included a few other minor amendments in the bill to reduce duplication, to streamline the operation of the act and to reduce red tape consistent with our red tape reduction agenda. The amendments proposed by the opposition in the Senate, which the government deems unacceptable, include wanting to enshrine the name of the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program in the act. These projects are already funded under the act and budgeted for and, as such, including a new separate part is a completely unnecessary duplication. Mr Albanese has briefed the crossbench that, unless the heavy vehicle program is named specifically in legislation, it will not continue. Let's be clear, this government is committed to that program and is spending more on the heavy vehicle program than Labor ever did. The budget papers clearly demonstrate this. Mr Albanese himself did not find it necessary to make significant amendments when he corrected the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. He did one minor thing at that time. He only changed the definition of 'road' in legislation because that is all that was needed to establish the program. So why is he now proposing eight pages of amendments just on the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens also want to complicate and inappropriately create an additional role for Infrastructure Australia in this bill when in fact this act has nothing to do with the administrative arrangements of Infrastructure Australia. This clearly makes no sense. If Labor was serious about looking after local councils and cutting red tape, it would simply pass the bill unamended. I ask Labor to point to just one aspect of the bill that is unacceptable. This is a simple piece of legislation. It is a very simple bill to extend the Roads to Recovery program and to fund our local government authorities for that purpose—to change the name of the bill and to tidy up other aspects of the act consistent with the government's red tape reduction agenda. That is all that it does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is true that we were forced to withdraw the legislation from the Senate in the final sitting of parliament before the winter recess because it was clear that it would not have passed without major unacceptable amendments proposed by Labor and their allies the Greens. Many of the proposed amendments are unacceptable to the coalition as they are either not directly relevant to the bill or will add needless bureaucracy and red tape to the operation of programs for local councils.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we are hopeful that Labor and Greens senators will do the right thing by local councils and the right thing by the communities within those councils. As a government we will continue to stand up for local communities rather than playing petty games which affect the everyday lives of commuters, particularly on roads in regional Australia. The bill reinserts a power for the minister to determine the Roads to Recovery list, which is essential for the program to be able to function. This power was removed from the act when it was amended in 2009 by the previous Labor government. Clearly, the opposition had little tolerance for the Roads to Recovery program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill renames the act to the National Land Transport Act 2014, removing the link between the name of the act and the name of the Land Transport Infrastructure Funding Program. This means that when a funding program ends or its name changes in the future there will no longer be a need to amend the legislation and it will therefore be a reduction in the administrative burden. This removes the politics from the act. The opposition has claimed the bill was entirely about removing the nation-building branding of the former government and nothing more. This government is about substance and certainly not slogans. The bill is needed to extend the Roads to Recovery Act and that is what we are trying to do with this quite simple and straightforward piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the crossbenchers to think very carefully about the way they will vote on the amendments particularly. You can vote to continue the Roads to Recovery program, which I trust that you will do, by rejecting the amendments proposed by Labor and the Greens. Local government will certainly thank you for that. The government will thank you for that. We will not have to see the unnecessary toing and froing of the bill and we will guarantee the much needed funding flowing expeditiously to local governments so they can manage their roads properly and safely. Alternatively, you could vote to support the various amendments by the Labor Party and the Greens, but you will be alone in doing so and will contribute to the uncertainty that now confronts local governments and local authorities as to where they are going to get their funding to do the road maintenance that their communities so desperately need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be very clear. As I have said, this is a very simple piece of legislation. It is a very simple bill to extend the Roads to Recovery program, to change the name of the legislation, and to tidy up some small and other aspects of the act consistent with our red-tape reduction agenda, and that is all it does. Why is that so offensive? Why has that become so controversial? This bill simply amends the act which was in place under Mr Albanese. Mr Albanese did not see it necessary to add a separate section on heavy vehicle projects. Mr Albanese did not have a so-called transparency clause that makes the minister direct Infrastructure Australia and his department, but then Mr Albanese did not have a transparent Infrastructure Australia either, and he funded many, many projects that came nowhere near Infrastructure Australia's priority list and ignored others on that priority list. Mr Albanese says that the government has no new projects. If the government has no new projects, why does he now insist on Infrastructure Australia assessing all the projects he previously committed to? Is he doubting whether he chose projects that do not demonstrate value for money?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The two major areas where Labor and the Greens will seek to add to the bill are in relation to Infrastructure Australia's functions and in relation to the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. I want to be very clear: the Australian government stand by their promise to ensure infrastructure projects over $100 million are assessed by Infrastructure Australia, and Infrastructure Australia will publish its justification for recommending projects for government funding. We will be introducing amendments in the house that specifically deal with this, and I am on the record to say precisely that. There is no need to delay funding to local councils for Roads to Recovery by attempting to create additional roles for Infrastructure Australia in this bill. They should be in the Infrastructure Australia Act where, of course, we all know they belong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also committed to heavy vehicle safety. We agree that the program, the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program created by the Labor Party, is an important and successful program for heavy vehicle safety. In fact, we were so impressed with their program that we are extending it and providing more money for it than they ever, in fact, did. The coalition government are also helping those in the heavy vehicle sector by providing an enormous program of works, the largest infrastructure program ever to ensure safer roads for use by heavy vehicles and those that share the roads with them. Let me list a small sample of other initiatives that the government are pursuing to improve heavy vehicle safety. Firstly, a review of the National Heavy Vehicle Accreditation Scheme and of heavy vehicle inspection regimes. Secondly, mandatory load proportioning or anti-lock braking systems for all model prime movers. Thirdly, state, territory and Commonwealth governments are working collaboratively with industry to determine research and trials for the next generation of braking control systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to heavy vehicle safety, may I take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Ricky Muir who over recent weeks has been instrumental in seeking continued government support for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. I pause to congratulate him on that very important contribution. My home state of Western Australia with B-doubles and very heavy vehicles certainly appreciates that input. It is a measure of the importance of this program for the Australian community that it attracts support from others in this chamber, and it is refreshing to talk to senators in this chamber who are willing to work constructively to secure clear and positive outcomes that benefit all Australians. Senator Muir, well done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the bill streamlines and enhances the operation of the act to the benefit of states, territories and the Commonwealth by removing unnecessary duplication. It provides clarity with one set of funding conditions and approval processes for the majority of projects funded under the act. The bill also assists the government's deregulation agenda by repealing three spent land transport infrastructure acts. There are no regulatory or financial impacts on businesses, or on the not-for-profit sector, from the amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009, or from the repeal of the spent legislation. The bill is compatible with human rights as it does not raise any human rights issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry on 6 March 2014. The committee's report, which came down on 24 March, supported the legislation in its current form. So, let's talk no more of seeking to divert the parliament's course of providing strong funding for local governments and actually delivering on that funding. We have suspended private member's business today, not lightly, but with due consideration to the fact that local councils are desperately needing this money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the house. I commend this bill to all senators, and I urge you to think about those communities that need the support of their councils and their councils' funding to deal with this roads issue. I thank the Senate.</span>

Accountability and making sure that investment in transport infrastructure is cost-effective is incredibly important because, when you are investing in transport, we have got a limited budget. We have got to make sure that they are being spent in the most appropriate way possible. That is what this amendment is seeking to achieve with these important investments that are going to be made into our transport infrastructure.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  Labor opposes Green's amendment (5). Labor has opposition amendment (7), which is a copy with slight changes. Labor supports $100 million as the mandatory threshold for Infrastructure Australia evaluation. Black spots, heavy vehicles and transport innovation projects are never anywhere near $50 million, let alone $100 million. The $50 million is almost the entire annual allocation to these entire programs, let alone individual projects. This is the point that the government has made and which the opposition has accepted in drafting this alternative amendment. Labor supports the majority of the content in principle but we prefer our amendment. </span>

In relation to Greens amendment (6), Labor does not support it but agrees with its intent. However, the amendment appears to duplicate other provisions and is not clearly drafted. Labor has an alternative amendment relating to Infrastructure Australia's assessments or projects which it will support.</span>

I am very pleased to hear that the opposition are opposing the Greens amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 7495. The bad news is that opposition amendments (5) and (7) will also be opposed by the government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my summing-up, I think I set out the significance of why we are opposed to that, and Senator Cameron has gone a long way towards setting out very good reasons why Greens amendment (5) should be opposed. The amendments require the minister—in talking about the broad thrust of all of the amendments, (5) and (7) of the opposition's also—to consult with Infrastructure Australia prior to approving a project under the act, including Infrastructure Australia providing an evaluation for projects with a capital expenditure of $100 million or more. The evaluation is to include a cost-benefit analysis of the program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill, recently passed, had a mechanism that would have enabled Infrastructure Australia to provide advice on projects over the $100 million threshold, but the amendments moved by the opposition and the Greens actually delete it. They did not want the minister to have directional powers over Infrastructure Australia. Yet, in order to achieve the outcome that they want here, the opposition and the Greens require the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia to give him information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be clear—either it is acceptable for the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia or it is not. The amendments that are being proposed here require the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia. Having said that and having spelt out the reasons for our opposition, I confirm again that we will be opposed to each of these Greens amendments as similar as they are to opposition amendments (5) and (7) on sheet 7477.</span>

In terms of the cost-benefit analysis and the inclusion of that in the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill—given the importance of the cost-benefit analysis, the commitment to the cost-benefit analysis for projects over $100 million, what really is the problem with including it in this bill? The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill is an overarching bill pulling together funding for transport. I really cannot see the problem of including the cost-benefit analysis in this bill. It really seems to fit here and this is where it belongs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment incorporates into the purposes of what is to be funded whether it is appropriate to approve a project. There is a whole list of criteria currently in the bill, matters to which the minister may have regard in deciding whether it is appropriate to approve a project as an investment project. One of them, in the existing proposed bill, is the extent to which the project would improve the efficiency, security or safety of transport operations. This amendment would change that so that it became 'efficiency, security, safety, integration of environmental sustainability' of transport operations—so, including the terms 'integration' and 'environmental sustainability'.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think this would bring it into line with what is basically standard practice across the country and would reflect all economic, social and environmental criteria. For example, the Victorian Transport Integration Act has a vision statement that says that the aspiration of Victorians for an integrated and sustainable transport system is that it contributes to an inclusive, prosperous and environmentally responsible state. I think including those things—transport integration, making sure that our transport systems are working effectively together, all supporting each other—is a very important concept when you are talking about what we should be investing in for transport. And environmental sustainability, as part of a trio of looking at environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and social responsibility, really should be there in the purposes for any investment in transport infrastructure.</span>

Labor has had some detailed discussion with the Australian Greens about this amendment. We will not support the amendment. We would prefer to add 'integrated' alone, as we consider that environmental sustainability is already adequately covered in the section and is confusing. So, we would prefer opposition amendment (6) on sheet 7477. We believe that the issues the Greens have raised are adequately covered in opposition amendment (6).</span>

When you introduce phrases like that into the day-to-day administration of what should be a simple funding regime, as this bill seeks to do, you really do open a bit of a Pandora's box in terms of administration on the ground and in terms of budgetary positions and compliance issues. These phrases now, rightly or wrongly—and I do not criticise the importance of them—do carry with them some responsibility to get things right. All I am saying is that in this instance this is inappropriate. It makes it more complex to administer. And I do not think that is what we are about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Opposition amendments (5) and (7) go to amend the issue of prior consultation with the experts at Infrastructure Australia. It is about transparency of advice to government. We believe this is an important element that is central to the much-called-for proper governance in project selection. The Land Transport Infrastructure Act is the sole enabling act that governs the terms under which the infrastructure minister can authorise expenditure of Commonwealth funds on road and rail projects. No other act does this—certainly not the Infrastructure Australia Act, which has a different purpose.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Infrastructure Australia Act establishes a body of experts who provide advice to government on infrastructure policy and projects. Infrastructure Australia looks at energy and water as well. It looks at best practice project procurement, it looks at what the nation lacks and suggests what it needs, and it flags future needs, assesses project value and flags emerging issues in the sector. It primarily has a strategic focus.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe this is an appropriate amendment. There is no reason to expect that a government seeking to amend the act will return to this parliament in the next six years. This is the only time the Senate will have a certain chance to ensure that ministers must seek expert advice from Infrastructure Australia before spending on road and rail projects valued at more than $100 million.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Item seven requires the minister to require an evaluation by Infrastructure Australia prior to approving funds for an infrastructure investment project valued at more than $100 million. Such an evaluation needs to include a cost-benefit analysis, Infrastructure Australia's view on project priority and other views Infrastructure Australia considers relevant. Item five provides that if the project is funded the evaluation must be published on the department's website for all taxpayers to see, within 14 days of notice of funding. The amendment is consistent with the Productivity Commission's call for much-improved infrastructure projects selection, assessment and transparency. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments implement explicit coalition election policy. The coalition had policy about these issues—that is, transparency and cost-benefit analyses. We want to ensure that that promise is not broken, that it does not become another broken government promise. It certainly is about ensuring we do not have the pork-barrelling that has been used in the past by the coalition, using scarce taxpayers money.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This aligns with the government's election commitments on infrastructure as elucidated in the coalition's policy to deliver the infrastructure for the 21st century. What it says in the coalition policy is that to ensure more rigorous, transparent assessment of taxpayer-funded projects we will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis. Labor's amendment here does nothing more than implement the exact commitment the coalition made to the Australian people at last year's election. We would expect the coalition to abide by that election promise and support these amendments.</span>

This is not the enabling legislation for Infrastructure Australia's functions. The Infrastructure Australia legislation has a section on responsibilities, which Labor and the Greens recently passed. Now they wish to make what appears to the government to be a back-door amendment to Infrastructure Australia's powers and, interestingly, to provide the minister with powers of direction over Infrastructure Australia. The 17A heading is 'Consultation with Infrastructure Australia'. The opposition should acknowledge that the heading should say 'Ministerial Directions over Infrastructure Australia', because that is exactly what this amendment is seeking to achieve. It is terribly unclear, may I say, in furtherance of what I have already said, what matters should be included in this evaluation that the opposition is proposing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision would need to prescribe the matters that must be covered in an evaluation, as those matters are not specified in the Infrastructure Australia Act, for the purposes of the general evaluation function—that is, it needs to be made clear what is the intended relationship with the scheme for evaluations under the Infrastructure Australia Act. This amendment does not even go close to doing anything like that. So it is inappropriate that any provisions purporting to give Infrastructure Australia power should be provided for in this bill, which has a completely different purpose, as I have sought to establish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The correct place for provisions relating to Infrastructure Australia functions and powers is in its own enabling legislation. The opposition stated that it wishes the government to stand by its election commitment, and has repeated that again this morning, and on Infrastructure Australia assessing proposals of over $100 million. To ensure the government does this, it proposed amendments to the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014. The government said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The government will require all Commonwealth-funded projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis by Infrastructure Australia to ensure the best use of available taxpayer monies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">We will require Infrastructure Australia to publish justifications for all its project recommendations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what we promised to the people at the last election, and we stand by that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that this bill not be further delayed by the undermining tactics of this amendment. The opposition had the opportunity to include these changes and those relating to the heavy vehicle program when in government. The question must be asked: it was just 12 months ago that the opposition had the capacity to make these amendments to this bill, so why did they not do so?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the former minister, Infrastructure Australia had no independence and simply prioritised projects based on how developed a business case was and not on whether it had any sustainable merit. The former government did not apply this government's level of transparency to their investments. There is no better example than that there was no cost-benefit analysis done for the NBN, the biggest single infrastructure project in Australia's history. After designing their plans for the NBN on the back of a beer coaster, Labor initially told us that the NBN would cost $43 billion and then revised it up to $44 billion. But the NBN strategic review, released in December last year, showed that the network would actually cost $73 billion.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear: we do not want to hold up money, vital resources and funding from going to local governments any longer. Let's just let this bill do what it clearly sets out to do, and that is to fund the Roads to Recovery program.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I have to respond to some of the issues that Senator Johnston has raised. First of all, let's be clear about the delays to this bill. The government itself delayed this bill coming to the Senate for 155 days. The bill passed the lower house on 24 March and it was not brought here until yesterday. So there was a delay of 155 days that the government itself imposed on this bill. Do not come here pontificating about delays when it sat there for 155 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I say that the government have made a commitment to the public for accountability and cost-benefit analyses. This is about accountability, cost-benefit analyses and holding the government to their election promise. If you do not support this then you can add this to the vast number of premises that you have trashed since you have come to government.</span>

The first fact that all of those listening to this debate need to understand is that in the House of Representatives the Labor Party opposition voted against the bill. The Labor Party voted not to give vital money for the Roads to Recovery program to local government. They voted against it. The reason this legislation is here is that, when in government, the Labor Party sunsetted the provision of funding to local government. They put the booby-trap in the legislation when they were in power, clearly anticipating they would be where they are now. The fact is that we need to get this funding to local government. Let's get on with it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  Again, I cannot understand where the government are going on this. It is clear that once this bill is passed it does not have to come back here for at least six years. It does not have to come back here again for the next two half-Senates. This is something that is simply holding the government to account for its election promises. It is about accountability. It is not about obstructionism from anyone. We are prepared to accept the bulk of this bill without amendment because it ensures that we have proper land transport infrastructure projects being brought forward. But they can only be brought forward if there is accountability and transparency. That is a promise this government made when it went to the election. That is what this amendment delivers on. It is about accountability. It is about transparency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the history of the coalition in government. We know that they always have to have a leash on National Party projects that are simply not sustainable, that are about pork-barrelling and that deliver nothing but an election boost for the local National Party member. We want infrastructure to be a nationally important issue. Labor in government did more than any other government on infrastructure spending and infrastructure support. We have never had a history of being obstructionist. We are not being obstructionist on this; we simply want your promise kept—the promise that you would be accountable and transparent. That is what this is about, not delay.</span>

Infrastructure Australia, under a different legislative framework, is already getting on with the job. To be clear, we will introduce amendments next week—and I am on the record now for good reason—to the Infrastructure Australia Act which will increase the level of transparency, as we said we would. In this context, we said we would get Infrastructure Australia to provide justification for its advice in a transparent, open and visible way—and we will, as we promised.</span>

We you have just outlined is an absolute con job. This act is where the money is spent and this act is what determines what the projects are. To say that the Infrastructure Australia Act should be changed is wrong. It is not dealing with the issue. This is where the money is spent. This is where you should be accountable. This does not have to come back again for six years, and there will be no arguments about not moving forward on key projects, provided they are accountable, provided a cost-benefit analysis has been done, provided they are transparent. To run what you have just run is a false argument. It is taking people up a blind alley. This is where the action is and this is where we should make the amendments to ensure your accountability. What we as Labor say is that if we do not get it here than we have lost accountability on the coalition. That would be a national disaster.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are amendments relating to formalisation of the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program. Amendment (8) will elevate this important program and give it the parliamentary approval that it currently lacks. It will ensure that the specific program criteria is oversighted by the parliament, is in legislation and cannot be changed without parliamentary approval. This is an important program that is improving safety, not just for truck drivers but for all road users. The first four of these items add the heavy vehicle safety program to definitions in the act in a manner consistent with the existing program. Item (1) inserts 'heavy vehicle safety program' into the Act's definition of an eligible funding recipient. Item (2) inserts the HVSPP into the Act's definition of approved purposes. Item (3) inserts a definition reference to the HVSPP, and item (4) inserts a reference to the project approval instrument for the HVSPP. Item (8) inserts a new Part 7 (a) to the Act that outlines the essential elements of the HVSPP in a manner consistent with other programs under the Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the heavy vehicle amendments moved here are slightly reworked against the amendments moved in the House in March. The opposition listened carefully to the technical points raised by the government in that debate, and we have resolved those points in the amendments moved here today. We trust that the government will acknowledge these changes, rather than raising the same points here, because that would be inaccurate. Specifically, the concerns raised about additional record-keeping being required by funding recipients have been addressed by removing this provision. Conditions of fund payment, auditing and inspection requirements remain as per now with the current requirements reflecting Parts (3) and (6) of the Act, the current source of funding for this program. </span>

I take it that by moving amendments (8), (1), (4) and (9) on 7477 the opposition is adopting the Greens amendment? This is very similar to Greens amendments (8), (1), (4) and (9) on 7495. We will be opposing these amendments. They propose a definition for heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects to allow the amendments to support amendment (7) to have effect, as we have dealt with. These amendments provide for heavy vehicle projects. This provision is totally unnecessary and I do believe that the opposition understands that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It still insists on eight pages of amendments to provide for a separate section on the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, which is a program that is already provided for under legislation. Creating an entirely new section on heavy vehicle projects duplicates existing provisions in parts 3 and 6 of the current act. Parts 3 and 6 are being combined in this bill to reduce red tape, to reduce duplication and to streamline the operation of the act. But it is important to understand the government sees heavy vehicle administration in public policy as a very important responsibility and an important program. It has committed more funding to that program than ever the opposition did when it was in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments create cumbersome, burdensome and expensive red tape. The opposition and their allies in the Greens are about creating regulatory burdens and not reducing them. There is not a regulation that they have ever seen that they did not want to like or add into legislation. That is what they are doing here. This group of amendments does not value-add one iota in terms of heavy vehicle safety and productivity. It just creates more process and compliance burdens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects are already catered for in the current legislation. These provisions place additional reporting obligations on funding recipients, on top of the audit and financial reporting already required. Road accident data is already collected by the bureau of infrastructure and regional development, which is a well-respected research organisation. If these amendments were to be supported, funding recipients will have to do all of this work, effectively repeating the data collection that is already taking place. What is the point of that? If the desire is to make mum-and-dad trucking businesses work longer hours for absolutely no benefit, then this should be supported. Please, do not support it. Please, crossbenchers, do not support these amendments. We do not want to increase the burden, particularly to small and medium enterprises and family businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition talks about being committed to productivity, but here we have evidence that what they want to achieve actually heads in the opposite direction, ensuring project proponents are doing the work that is already being done by government. I have heard claims that unless heavy vehicle projects are given their own section in the act there is no guaranteed funding. The opposition has been predictably and habitually misleading in dealing with this bill, providing crossbenchers with the string of erroneous so-called facts on the bill. The facts are these. This bill is about a very minor amendment to a very successful act; extending—as I have said on several occasions—much-needed funding to the Roads to Recovery program; changing the name of the act; and, reducing red tape. It is very, very simple.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens and the opposition have colluded on these pointless amendments to jam up the operation of the progress of this vital funding. I have no doubt the crossbenchers are somewhat drawn in two different directions, and, as time goes by, they are coming to grips with a multitude of legislation and process. I want them to be very, very careful that what is happening here is understood by them. This bill is simple. It is about funding local government. What is being sought in these particular amendments, with respect to the heavy vehicle program, are entirely pointless and misleading.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that the program would receive funding under legislation, all Mr Albanese needed to do was to amend the definition of 'road' in this act and that is exactly what he did. In 2008, he introduced the AusLink (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill to add to the definition of 'road' in section 4. I quote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(va) a facility off the road used by heavy vehicles in connection with travel on the road (for example, a rest area or weigh station);</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what this amendment seeks to do has been done. Mr Albanese knew that it was not necessary to include it in a full, separate section. It was necessary then and it clearly is not necessary now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to a number of other programs that are not provided separate legislation or status in the legislation. If the heavy vehicle program were to be included, then, for consistency, and to ensure no doubt about the status of those other programs, we would probably also need to include them in the legislation. That is the incongruous nature of these misconceived amendments. This could potentially add up to 40 pages of unnecessary process to the bill. The government is committed to reducing red tape, not creating it. These other programs include the Bridges Renewal Programme, the managed motorways program, the regional roads program and the national highways program. Not one of these is named in the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Simply naming a program in legislation does not guarantee its funding. Funding is appropriated by a parliament through the budget process. In this case, we are absolutely committed to funding projects under the heavy vehicle program and money was appropriated for that program by the parliament in July. If the opposition amendments were to be agreed to, funding to this program would be held up because the guidelines under which applicants are applying would be inconsistent with the legislation.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Changing the status of this funding round will create uncertainty for the applicants as well as waste time and money for those applicants, for local and state governments and for our hardworking officers inside the federal government. Having said that, I hope I have established, particularly with the crossbenchers, that these amendments are completely counterproductive to common sense and to achieving what the bill achieves—that is, the funding of local governments for the Roads to Recovery program.</span>

For this government the removal of red tape is to remove protections—remove protections for working people and remove checks and balances on the operation of businesses that need to be checked and balanced. Red tape to this government is simply about removing a role for government and letting the market rip. That is the removal of red tape for this government. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will not make the bill cumbersome. It will not make it burdensome. The paperwork issue was addressed. What we have here is Senator Johnston basically reading the same speech that was made in the lower house, the same speech that was made in the other place, even though section 86R has been removed.</span>

                    </a>  No, Senator Johnston, it is not about consistency; it is about sloppiness, because you have not dealt with this issue. The issue of 86R has been removed. This is about ensuring that we elevate this important program and give it parliamentary approval. It is about ensuring that we have oversight. It is about improving safety not just for the truck drivers but for all road users. If you want to abandon the safety of truck drivers and the safety of road users on the ideological agenda of this government to remove red tape and to remove protections then that will be a very detrimental situation. </span>

But, given that the opposition's amendments are being considered first, we will be supporting them.

It is of relevance to funding for heavy vehicle projects, as it is of relevance to funding for other road projects. I refer to a comment that Senator Lambie was reported as saying on radio yesterday morning—that, in the negotiations with the government over this bill, she had secured an extra $200 million for roads in the west of her state as part of supporting this bill. I want to ask Senator Johnston whether that in fact was the case.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  Labor stands for the protection of our oceans, we stand for the rights of recreational fishers and we stand for business certainty. Labor has a strong track record of respecting our oceans and all its users and we have a strong track record of basing our decisions on the science. In 2012, a private company sought to introduce a massive supertrawler vessel to Australian waters. The Labor government acted to provide certainty and to ensure the science was in place to support decisions on ocean use. We introduced tough new measures that required proper scientific assessments to be made by an expert panel. That was the responsible thing to do. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost two years later, however, our oceans are vulnerable again. The tough powers that Labor introduced have now lapsed. The Abbott government has had almost 12 months in office to do something to address this gap in our laws. They have had time to boost our ocean defences against the threat of new supertrawler vessels. Instead they have done nothing. This private senator's bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014, has been in the Senate for months and they have not even taken the hint to get on with protecting our oceans. This legislation today does that work for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all remember that, when Labor introduced the tough sanctions against the supertrawler in 2012, the Liberals and Nationals voted against the then government's measures. Thirty-three members of the House of Representatives and the Senate spoke against Labor's measures to stop the supertrawler—all of them Liberals or National Party members. Deep down the Liberals and the Nationals have always supported removing the vital protections of our oceans—that it is in their DNA is unquestionable. As Hobart's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> reported on 9 September 2012:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmanian Liberal senator Richard Colbeck told the crowd he supported the super trawler.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this government has not acted to bring back strict protections against supertrawlers. They have been hoping that any new vessel would appear unobtrusively from over the horizon and quietly start fishing in Australian waters without any scientific checks or balances. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 12 months, the Abbott government has been breaking promises, hurting low- and middle-income earners and being incompetent to boot. The Australian people got their first whiff of the twisted priorities of this government with the announcement of the reintroduction of—would you believe it—knights and dames. That pure farce has now turned into budget pain. All the while, the Labor Party has been working in the national interest. We have been standing up for jobs, we have been supporting a plan for Australia's future and we are standing up for the environment and our oceans. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is now desperately trying to rewrite history. Despite 33 members of the coalition speaking against Labor's plan to stop the supertrawler, the Prime Minister has tried to spin it—saying that he supported the ban all along. He is the weathervane of Australian politics. Before the election, he voted to let the supertrawler enter Australian waters unchecked. After the election, he has changed his position, just as before the election he hid the worst of his budget cuts and his plans to destroy Australian jobs. Before the election, the Prime Minister voted to keep the supertrawler here. After the election he said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was banned with the support of members on this side of the House. It was banned; it will stay banned.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth saying that again. The Prime Minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Prime Minister said—categorically. It is in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>: a blatant mistruth, a clearly incorrect statement to the House from the Prime Minister.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has had months to act and they have done nothing. Only Labor is concerned with our oceans and the users of our oceans. This bill addresses serious concerns about the science and it addresses serious community concerns. If the Prime Minister, the agriculture minister or the parliamentary secretary were serious about protecting our oceans, they would have acted already. I am not precious; they could have picked up my bill and claimed it as their own and got a real win for Australia's oceans. Instead they have done nothing. If you reflect on that, it really makes you wonder whether or not they just like to sit on their hands and do nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill I have introduced will restore the tough powers to the Minister for the Environment to act where new types of fishing operations seek to work in Australian waters and where uncertainty exists about their conduct. The environment minister, in consultation with the fisheries minister, will again be able to declare particular methods of fishing and require a scientific assessment to be undertaken for up to two years. That is the sensible way to progress when new fishing methods are proposed. An expert panel will be constituted and will be able to consider the impacts of any new venture that is declared. This will provide the community, recreational fishers and businesses alike with certainty before these declared ventures operate in Australian waters. There will be a proper process whereby the expert panel can call for submissions, look at the scientific evidence and ensure there is proper consultation with all parties and stakeholders in the debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very important to ensure certainty for all stakeholders, even those who want to introduce the supertrawler. This legislation will establish certainty of process, certainty of consultation, certainty about the expert panel's findings and certainty about the science. This legislation will enable the community to feel assured that they have a clear understanding of what is occurring—because it is surprises that hurt people. Mind you, this government is an expert at surprises that hurt people. So it is not unsurprising to me to find that a government such as this has ignored the science. It has ignored the opportunity to look at how it can fix this issue and, instead, has sat on its hands and let it lapse. But, ultimately, what I think is more galling about all of this is that the Prime Minister stands up and says, 'It has always been banned; it will continue to be banned', yet that was not what he did when he was called to account. When the vote was had in this place, those opposite supported the supertrawler. They opposed our legislation back then and they continue to fudge where their position is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will give the coalition a clear opportunity to put their position and explain to the parliament where they sit on this matter. It is very important that the people in Tasmania, the people on the east coast of Australia and those along the South Australian bight understand what the process is for a supertrawler should it come over the horizon again. I think this government breeds uncertainty, because it wants to be able to deal with such a situation when it occurs rather than have a clear process in place. This legislation focuses on addressing uncertainty related to so-called `supertrawler' fishing vessels. Why? Because business requires certainty, the community requires certainty and stakeholders and third parties also require certainty in this debate. People should have the ability to have a say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, this legislation will allow the government of the day to stop new supertrawlers before they come to Australia, just as Labor did when in office. The amendments give the government of the day the power to declare a particular type of fishing activity which has not been used in Australia previously and where some uncertainty exists around it to ensure proper and thorough expert scientific work is conducted. This has been the case in the past when the government moved to declare the activities that were proposed for the supertrawler known as the FV <span style="font-style:italic;">Margiris</span> or, oddly, temporarily, the FV <span style="font-style:italic;">Abel Tasman</span>. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will remove a 12-month sunset provision, bringing the new chapter 5B of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act back into effect. By removing division 4 of part 15B, the environment minister's powers to respond to new commercial fishing operations will be restored, as it currently is subject to the sunset clause that is in effect at present. It is sunsetted now. The bill will bring that provision back. This means that there is currently no power under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for the government to act to declare fishing activities, including supertrawlers. The bill restores the powers still on the statue books—namely the powers to enable the minister for environment (with the agreement of the Commonwealth fisheries minister) to make an interim declaration that a fishing activity is a prohibited 'declared commercial fishing activity' while an expert panel assesses the potential environmental impacts of the activity; to enable the minister for environment (with the agreement of the Commonwealth fisheries minister) to make a final declaration for a period no longer than 24 months, that a fishing activity is a prohibited 'declared commercial fishing activity'; to provide for the establishment of an expert panel in the case of the making of a final declaration and specify the terms of reference of the panel and its reporting date, with a requirement that a copy of the panel report be made publicly available—because on this side of the chamber we support transparency, openness and accountability; to provide for appropriate procedural fairness protections for 'declaration affected persons'; and to create civil penalty and offence provisions for engaging in a declared commercial fishing activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures are required to address the risk of new and future supertrawlers or other new methods of commercial activity that have not previously been used in Australia. It is a precautionary approach. It will better allow community and environmental groups, together with business, to work with a scientific expert panel to assess the true impacts of new and large-scale fishing operations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would add as a note to these amendments that, if passed, it would be prudent for the government to take other actions to improve the management of new and proposed fishing activities. The Department of the Environment and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority should establish protocols to better communicate between these two agencies in the operation of the act. It would be a sensible reform and would be able to be done at the agency level. I am surprised that they have not already undertaken that work. Perhaps we will hear from the coalition that they have already started to do that work—but I would be surprised if they had. This is a coalition that does not act easily or seek easy solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand, of course, there is a view that it would be preferable to just ban supertrawlers outright based on their class of vessel. I do not hold this view. The approach I have proposed is a logical, sensible, science based approach that treats each applicant on its merits and on the science. To do otherwise would be anti business and anti science. For that reason, I suspect the Greens party may take a stricter view than I have taken, but I will wait to hear their view on this. Under this bill, where the science goes so too do the decisions of the agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has some of the best managed fisheries in the world. There is, however, a gap in the system in considering the powers of the environment and fisheries ministers to consider new commercial fishing vessels before they arrive and begin to fish. Given the government has failed to act, it is sensible for these powers to be restored. Labor is standing up for the oceans, recreational fishers and local businesses. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise to put on the record the government's opposition to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill, proposed by Labor, and the Greens amendments to the bill. Australia boasts a globally benchmarked and recognised fishing industry where policies have been based on scientific research and not the whims of political interest groups. The bill before us does little to stop or ban supertrawlers from applying to operate in Australian fisheries. We believe we need a long-term, more permanent solution to ensure that our fishing industry is sustainable for years to come and that we do not follow the path taken by other nations which has led to unviable, unsustainable fishing industries. The legislation covers only two years, and we want a long-term solution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are seeing from the Labor Party and the Greens is proof of yet another dysfunctional Labor policy that undermines the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Australia's fishing industry is not to be laughed at—it is a significant contributor to communities and to economic growth, and it is an industry we perform very well in. It extends up to 200 nautical miles out to sea, and Australia's commercial fishing and aquaculture industry is worth over $2 billion annually and employs around 11,600 people—7,300 through direct employment and 4,300 through indirect employment. It is a vital natural resource and one we are committed to maintaining. It is a natural resource that needs to be managed appropriately so it can be enjoyed and used in a sustainable manner. That is what this government is committed to doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Simone Weil said, 'attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be attained only by someone who is detached.' It is this detachment that we believe ensures AFMA is the best body to help us come to terms with the reality of our fishing industry. Consulting with detached independent experts provides us with this sense of reality. We are waiting to consult the expert panel appointed to assess the impacts of the activities covered by the first declaration, and it is due to finalise its report by 22 October 2014. Rather than waiting for that report to come before us to inform further action, if it is required, we are once again hurtling towards ill-informed legislation seeking to fix a problem that does not exist. To inform its assessment the expert panel met with stakeholders in Hobart on 2 May 2014. A panel for the second declaration is yet to be appointed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not being pressured by interest groups like GetUp! to stop supertrawlers—we are looking to a viable and long-term option that has been scientifically proven and assessed. Unlike those opposite, who seek to use scientists for their political gain, we are committed to applying true scientific principles to our decision making in this area, as indeed we do in all areas of environmental interest, so we can keep our fisheries management systems world-class and ensure that fishing can be sustained. Let us face it, most of us are not vegans; most of us are not vegetarians. I would much prefer to go into Coles and Woolworths and IGA, and indeed ALDI on occasion, and purchase seafood which is the product of Australia. When I see 'Product of Australia', I know that seafood is harvested from our oceans in a sustainable manner. When I see 'Product of Vietnam' or 'Product of Thailand' or 'Product of Indonesia' on the seafood that I might be choosing to feed my family and friends, I cannot be confident that that product is being harvested in a sustainable manner that will ensure that generations to come can eat this very healthy food source. So we are not being pressured by interest groups like GetUp!.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government works closely with AFMA to monitor how fisheries are managed. It is because we have confidence in AFMA that our fishing industry ranks as one of the best in the world—we are committed to getting it right and we are committed to using science to inform our policy decisions. These are the expert scientists, with extensive experience and PhDs in environmental science and management. It is an authority that has developed fishery management arrangements to meet government policies and to ensure fisheries are sustainable—not like in other nations, where the regulators just go and do what they are told to do by the government, this is a live dialogue between government and AFMA about what is the best way to proceed in order to meet government policy objectives for fisheries. AFMA is charged with implementing fisheries management arrangements, monitoring the compliance of commercial fishing, setting research priorities and arranging research related to AFMA managed fisheries. It deters noncompliance in domestic fisheries and deters illegal foreign fishing. It registers commercial fishing entitlements and licenses fishers, develops management policies and regulations and provides technical input to government policies. Aside from Senator Scullion, now that Senator Boswell is no longer with us there is very little fishing expertise in either this chamber or the other chamber. That is why we need to take the advice of bodies like AFMA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All these points are highlighted in AFMA's extensive and efficient management policies. The management plans that are in place in almost all of our Commonwealth managed fisheries go through a lengthy process of approval. There is a public consultation process in place, a determination by the AFMA commission and, finally, an approval by the fisheries minister. This management plan directly outlines the borders and location of a fishery, what season it can be used, the method of fishing, the level of extraction, bycatch mitigation methods and even the gear that can be used on boats. The process of managing a fishery is extensive, very detailed and often costly. However, we do not doubt its worth, as it is based on sound scientific reasoning and all costs are recovered because of our productive fishing industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are aware of the concern amongst a range of groups, including the rec fishers, about the potential impact of supertrawlers on Australia's marine environment, protected species and local fish stocks, but we are confident that the regulatory framework we have in place—and indeed our commitment to getting it right as a result of looking further into this issue—will result in a policy outcome that gets the balance right. It is possible to examine the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery, where operators are only allowed a limited amount of trips and must hold a relevant fishing concession which provides them access to an area in which to fish, a method by which they are allowed to fish, a boat permit and a relevant quota holding for that species. These processes are essential, because the SESSF has an estimated value of production of over $62 million, and we do not want see those viable operators being unable to do what they do well—which is to catch good fish in a way that ensures ongoing sustainability so that we can put it on the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is dedicated to listening to the expert in the AFMA about the best ways to protect our valuable natural resources. In 2007 Minister Abetz, as Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, enacted the Commonwealth harvest strategy, which fisheries like the SESSF must adhere to. The coalition government provided the AFMA with the independence to specify control rules for fishing activity and to monitor and assess the processes involved. The harvest strategy that each fishery must use is based on output controls. This means that we rely on how many fish can be caught sustainably in the area. We rely on the scientific evidence, like the extensive harvest strategies put before us by the fishing industry and the expert scientists, which ensure the best management approach and continued sustainability of Australia's great natural resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite what the ALP and Greens may say, we want to ensure the sustainability of this industry. We want particular species to be protected and there to be limits on the amount of fish that can be caught. I look to the bycatch reduction policies that are already in place. It is thanks to the coalition that in 2005 the AFMA were put in charge of managing the environmental impacts of fishing, including protected species, and minimising the incentives for discarding certain fish by ensuring that it is factored into the setting of total allowable catch levels. That is something that we did. If you listened to the ALP and Greens, you would think that we wanted a Newfoundlandesque approach to fishing in this nation so that there would be no more cod and Hobart would suddenly be singing the songs that St John's were singing during the 1950s and 1960s as that particular fishing resource was decimated by unsustainable practice. That is not what we want, and that is why for a long period of time various coalition governments have been committed to enacting policies for sustainable fishing practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, we also ensured the AFMA were put in charge of enhancing the monitoring of fishing activity through increased use of vessel monitoring systems, daily reporting, onboard cameras and improved observer coverage. This policy covers fisheries managed by the Commonwealth and represents a significant commitment by the then government and industry to ensure fisheries were managed on an ecologically sustainable basis. We want to ensure that high-risk fish are managed and able to be protected. A<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>bycatch and discard program that the AFMA oversees ensures that all threatened, endangered and protected species are part of an ecological risk assessment which involves heavy consultation with the industry and experts. Even the use of bycatch reduction devices provides high-risk fish with the opportunity to escape in high trawling waters—</span>

We are looking after the long term of our fishing industry, and protecting high-risk fish is a major priority. AFMA provides us with long-term strategies for effective fishing. The total allowable catch is determined by a commission established by AFMA. The commission consults those with commercial and recreational fishing knowledge, relevant states and bodies, representatives from the environmental and recreational sector and, most importantly, scientists. Every minute detail of our fishing industry is considered with wide consultation to make the best and most informed decisions possible for the betterment of our fishing industry. The AFMA is an independent body that we as the Commonwealth have confidence in. We allow the employees, who all have lengthy industry experience or environmental science qualifications, to monitor how fishing zones are operating. This ensures that fish are protected and we are provided with a transparent and independent system that has been left to the experts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Labor Party is proposing undermines our fishing system, which is the envy of the world. The sunset clause that Senator Ludwig is presenting detracts all ability from the environment minister to declare any further fishing activities and ensures that he or she must listen to an expert panel. What they fail to recognise is that we already listen to an expert panel of scientists with the best experience to implement these policies. They are proposing to undermine the AFMA and listen to interest groups which have no fishing experience, which do not understand the interplay between industry and the ocean and who are not interested in a sustainable fishing industry. They do not care, and they do not want it to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What they are actually interested in—a little like other groups that the Greens and some in the Labor Party choose to support—are things like the Aussie Farms website. The founder of that particular website has made public his desire to shut down industries that employ hundreds of thousands of Australians who contribute an incredible amount—over 12 per cent—to our GDP. They want those industries closed down. So, we can hide behind this veneer of seeking expert advice and carry on, but the actual intent is to shut industries down that employ Tasmanians, that are actually based on scientific principles and sustainable management practices, that actually provide one of the best food sources to Australians and indeed the world—high in all the good things, low in all the bad things: our fish.</span>

They will continue to make decisions based on sound judgement to ensure that fisheries are sustainable and meet all the ecological requirements.</span>

I do not understand why we cannot leave this to the experts, to the minister who relies on that advice. Let's end the dysfunctional politics of the Labor-Greens alliance, ensure that knee-jerk reactions are ignored and that interest groups do not have a greater influence than experts. What we are proposing is sound reasoning, detached from emotion.</span>

Absolutely nothing has changed. The coalition is happy for supertrawlers to come back to Australian waters. The Labor Party have introduced this bill—a bill that does not stop supertrawlers, does not ban supertrawlers. The bill was introduced by the previous minister, who presided over the arrival of the supertrawler and all the fuss that led to the moratorium. And by the way, Senator McKenzie, all the research work you quoted that has been done came about only because of the Greens and the conservation and rec fishing 'special interests', as you call them, in this country.</span>

This is an environment minister who has allowed dredging in the Great Barrier Reef, who has backflipped and broken promises on the Renewable Energy Target, on a price on carbon, and on his No. 1 darling issue: whaling in the Southern Ocean. Every year Minister Hunt—the same person who will have discretion if this bill gets up—berated and grandstanded against Peter Garrett, around his lack of action on whaling. But what happened when he became the environment minister? He rolled over and had his tummy tickled by the rest of his party room. He did nothing to prevent whaling in the Southern Ocean this summer. So, what is to say that he is going to prevent the arrival of a supertrawler and take action? And, by the way, if he does not, that would be just one of many broken promises from the coalition. I have the quote here from the Prime Minister saying that supertrawlers would be banned, but what Senator McKenzie outlined here today sounded nothing like the coalition were prepared to ban supertrawlers in these waters.</span>

I sat in this chamber and I debated that more work needed to be done on the science around the Small Pelagic Fishery and the very fishy business of the arrival of this boat, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Margiris</span>, whose name was later changed to <span style="font-style:italic;">Abel Tasman</span>—a very fishy business. It was done through campaigning in Tasmania and around the country—and there is absolutely no doubt that the recreational fishing community in this country and the Greens are not common bedfellows, but we were on this campaign, because the number one issue we both felt needed to be addressed was the issue of local depletion. It was the fact that a supertrawler can sit out to sea for long periods of time, follow large schools of small pelagic fish and deplete areas of fish. As far as I know from asking questions at recent estimates, there still has not been a definition of what constitutes local depletion. The Greens have been very clear in our policy on supertrawlers. We do want to see them banned. Two years ago we proposed an amendment that would have banned supertrawlers, with the onus of proof being on the proponents of new supertrawlers to prove that they would not damage the ocean.

                    </a>  —as do millions of Australians, Senator Brandis, through you, Chair. This issue has touched a never like no other environmental issue in recent history in this country. Today it has become very clear, through Senator McKenzie, that the coalition are prepared to let supertrawlers come back into Australian waters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />This bill, if it is passed, gives discretion back to the environment minister. It does not ban supertrawlers, and nor does it stop them. We need to be very clear about that. The reason I raise this issue is that I have seen a number of emails, media releases and even pamphlets mailed in my home state of Tasmania, saying that Labor is banning supertrawlers. Let us be very clear about that—it is not. In fact, based on what Senator Ludwig said earlier, it is doing almost exactly what it did two years ago, when the supertrawler arrived—it is saying, 'We will leave it to the experts. We will leave it to AFMA. We will leave it to the science.' The problem was that scientific work was not done. Even the resource assessment group, the RAG, at AFMA agreed that not enough scientific work had been done. It was not about the quality of the science that had been done. It was the fact that this fishery, which is highly sensitive to ecosystems, had not been studied for 12 years. That work is being done now, thanks to the Greens, thanks to recreational fishers and thanks to the conservation movement. We pushed and pushed to get that work done. Now, we have the two old parties in this chamber claiming that they have got this work done, and that somehow this is a victory. It is not. The work has not been finished, there is still considerable uncertainty in the science to this point. There is still a very real chance that these large fishing vessels, which have depleted oceans all around the world—no-one disputes that—are going to come back to Australian waters, because we will have an environment minister and a government in charge of policy who brought the supertrawler here in the first place and are very happy to look after their mates by bringing new trawlers to Australian waters, boats that Australians do not want. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Income Management is bad social policy. The vulnerable in our community need improved social services, higher incomes and employment opportunities, not measures that control their lives and restrict their movements. Aboriginal communities living under the Northern Territory (NT) Intervention have experienced four years of hardship and humiliation as a result of Income Management. There is no convincing evidence that Income Management has improved outcomes for welfare recipients.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Income Management is a gross waste of funds. In both the NT and the new proposed 'trial sites', the estimated cost per recipient per year is more than $4500.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Income Management is discriminatory. The Prescribed Area People's Alliance, representing communities across the NT have said, "The BasicsCard has disempowered us. It's very racist. We are going backwards to the welfare days". As the system expands across Australia, both Indigenous people and other already stigmatised groups will bear the burden.</span>

                  </a>  The government is committed to improving the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and we acknowledge the importance that good hearing has for social, education and health outcomes. Ensuring children are healthy and school ready is a core priority for this government. We recognise the importance of hearing in assisting children to be both ready to go to school and able to learn, to get the best outcome from their education experience. This is an important area for this government. To close the gap on Indigenous health outcomes this needs to be a priority across governments and requires bipartisanship. This is too important an issue to be developing policy on the run. We will continue to work with our colleagues in the states and territories and the opposition to progress action to improve ear health services for Indigenous Australians as a priority. Supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to be healthy, including good hearing, is a key priority to improve short- and long-term outcomes for Indigenous children, families and communities. I indicate that we will not be supporting the motion.</span>

                  </a>  One of the key priorities of the Abbott government is the reduction of violence against women and their children. In November 2013, the Prime Minister announced $1 million in funding for White Ribbon Australia to work with CALD and Indigenous communities, including new and emerging communities. The government is committed to implementing the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children 2010-2022 and ensuring its programs are properly resourced and effective. On 27 June 2014, the government launched the second action plan under the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children 2010-2022, a significant step in continuing the work in reducing violence against women and their children in Australia. The second action plan contains 26 practical actions that all Australian governments agree are critical at this stage for the national plan to improving women's safety. The Commonwealth is providing more than $100 million over the next four years to support the second action plan. The coalition's policies will focus on delivering greater personal safety to all Australian women. We will ensure that domestic violence is tackled and does not become intergenerational.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I am in continuation from yesterday evening. I finished yesterday evening by making the point that the contributions made by other senators were, in fact, extraneous to the particular regulation that we were considering. Indeed, I think I used the analogy of the Empire State Building for Senator Cameron's contribution, indicating that for every story or scenario there was a major flaw. That, regrettably, was the case yesterday and, of course, it remains the case today. For every story and for every cameo, his argument was majorly flawed—be it death; be it the caring responsibilities; be it injury as a result of a crime. All those issues are more than appropriately canvassed in this regulation, and it will be the professionals of the Department of Human Services that will be making the determinations, not the job service providers, as incorrectly asserted by the honourable senator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I finished off last night by saying that I would then make the rest of my contribution on the positive side as to what the regulation actually does—not what had been asserted previously. I indicate to the Senate that what the instrument does do is give decision makers in Centrelink—and I stress Centrelink—and on appeals tribunals much clearer guidance on what the government thinks is reasonable for them to take into account when deciding whether or not a job seeker had a reasonable excuse for failing to meet their mutual-obligation requirements. For example, the sudden serious illness or hospitalisation of the job seeker's child or partner, the recent death of an immediate family member or the job seeker being recently subjected to criminal or domestic violence would all clearly be exceptional circumstances beyond the job seeker's control. To assert otherwise is to assert that the people in the Department of Human Services would take an absolutely unprofessional and unreasonable approach to these potentially real-life situations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The instrument also makes it clear that paid work, attending a job interview, medical incapacity or unforeseeable and unavoidable caring responsibilities are all grounds for finding that a job seeker had a reasonable excuse. These are not necessarily exceptional circumstances, but so long as the job seeker gives prior notice, where it is possible for them to do so, they provide a reasonable excuse for the job seeker for not meeting their requirements. It is similar to the circumstance of being in actual employment: if you are sick one morning and you cannot go to work, the reasonable thing to do is to communicate with the relevant person at the workplace and indicate that to them, if at all possible, in advance. Similarly, we say to welfare recipients that in the event you cannot attend an appointment you are required to attend, because of sickness—like someone in the workforce—you simply make contact in advance and say: 'Regrettably, I am ill today' or 'On the way the car broke down and so I can't make it'. You make immediate contact, rather than giving that advice well after the event. The requirement to give prior notice, when possible, is also reasonable, I would suggest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note—and this is the one point that rounds all this off—that the legislative instrument is not exhaustive. It is clear in the primary legislation that this regulation is only a guide and cannot limit the matters that the decision maker is able to take into account in determining whether or not a job seeker had a reasonable excuse. In those circumstances, having cleared that up—and I will be kind this afternoon and say that they were inadvertent misrepresentations of the regulation yesterday—and having now explained what the regulation actually will do, as opposed to all the false assertions made about it, I commend the regulation to the Senate and encourage honourable senators to vote against the disallowance.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I have listened carefully to what Senator Abetz has said and he has not convinced me and he will certainly not convince the charities in this country who will face the full burden of this regulation and various other bills. What Senator Abetz has tried to do is to focus in isolation on the regulation. By doing that, he ignores other aspects of the social security legislation that come together to make it really tough on Australians who are unemployed and amongst some of the most disadvantaged people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, what this is about doing is punishing job seekers. It is setting up this dole bludger argument, which is based on the government's ideology, and the government's argument that if you cannot get a job, you really should not participate in society. It is the antithesis of everything the experts in this area tell you. Simply focusing on penalties and simply focusing on penal provisions against some of our poorest Australian citizens is just outrageous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Security (Reasonable Excuse—Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination is the legislative instrument the minister must make to determine a non-exhaustive list of matters that decision makers must consider in applying the persistent noncompliance test under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill and the determination are inextricably linked. For Senator Abetz to try to argue it differently is disingenuous and misleading. But that is what we expect from this government. It is a government of broken promises, a government brought to power, based on lies, and a government that seems determined to punish the poorest people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">See, the government wants the determination viewed in isolation. That is because, on the face of it, it seems innocuous—but it is not. When viewed in the big picture of employment service reforms that the government is trying to make, its dangers become clear. The government's package of reforms in this area is designed to disenfranchise and punish the unemployed of Australia. It includes the following measures—and you have to take this determination into account with all of these issues. Firstly, the determination that sets out what a decision maker must take into account in determining whether someone has a reasonable excuse for noncompliance under the Social Security Act; next is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill, which seeks to amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, in relation to the imposition of eight-week penalties on job seekers who are receiving a participation requirement for the serious failures; next is the Exposure Draft of the Employment Services 2015-2020 purchasing arrangements, which is the Job Services Australia tender document, which sets out the government's intentions in relation to the Job Services Australia program from 1 July 2015; next is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Job Seeker Compliance Framework) Bill, which seeks to strengthen the compliance arrangements for job seekers in receipt of activity-tested income support arrangements; and, the changes to Newstart for job seekers aged under 30 that will see them off income support for a continuing six-month cycle until they either get a job or turn 30.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these bills have to be read together to understand what this regulation and determination that the government has brought in really means. You have to look at what all of these acts do. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill was introduced by the coalition on Wednesday, 4 June 2014. The bill seeks to amend the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. Under current job seeker compliance provisions contained in the act, job seekers in receipt of participation payment—defined as Newstart and defined for some people as youth allowance, parenting payments and special benefits—may incur an eight-week non-payment period penalty for serious failures consisting either of refusal of suitable work or persistent noncompliance with their participation obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the act provides that such non-payment penalties may be waived if the job seeker begins to comply with a serious failure requirement—currently Work for the Dole, job search training or undertaking more intensive searches. These are the issues that have to be dealt with. The non-payment may also currently be waived if the job seeker does not have the capacity to comply with any such serious failure requirement and would be in serious financial hardship if the non-payment were not ended. What we have here is a government that want the unemployed, who are on $36 a day at the moment, to suffer a further penalty. As if having to live on $36 a day is not problem enough for some of our most disadvantaged Australians; the government wants to penalise them even more. It is because they have this dole bludger mentality, this ideology that if you do not have a job you are some kind of inferior Australian. They do not understand these issues. They do not understand the difficulty some Australians have in getting a job. They just don't get it. They want to penalise people on $36 a day, take all support away from them and leave them destitute and reliant on charity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of concerning aspects of the legislation, which has to be read in conjunction with the determination. Job seekers will be unable to re-engage during the eight-week non-payment period. Once you have been penalised, that is it—you have lost your payment. You cannot come and say, 'Look, I really want to get on top of this problem I have,' or, 'I've got on top of my problem and I want to re-engage.' You are gone for eight weeks, with absolutely no payments. No evaluations have been done on whether these changes are likely to be successful. The majority of people affected by the changes will have a vulnerability indicator already noted on their Centrelink records, meaning that they are disadvantaged in some way, including whether they have a mental illness or psychiatric problems, are homeless, have recently been discharged from prison, have had a recent traumatic relationship breakdown or have suffered from cognitive or neurological impairment. Indigenous job seekers are also over-represented amongst those who will be penalised. These are the people who need more help in our community, not penal provisions—not forced onto charity, not abandoned by the government. They should be supported and assisted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Social Security (Reasonable Excuse—Participation Payment Obligations) (Employment) Determination 2014 (No. 1) sets out a non-exhaustive list of matters which decision makers must consider in determining whether or not a reasonable excuse exists in relation to a job seeker's serious failure under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, being either refusal of suitable work or persistent noncompliance, before imposing a nine-week non-payment period. The proposed determination changes what constitutes a reasonable excuse for the purpose of the legislation. What is concerning is the discretion acknowledged to exist in determining whether circumstances directly prevent a job seeker from complying with requirements. The concept of 'directly prevent' is a new requirement introduced by the government and obviously narrows the discretion of the decision maker in deciding whether or not an excuse is reasonable. Also concerning is the removal of factors which currently must be taken into account when deciding whether a person has a reasonable excuse. These are: that the person did not have access to safe, secure and adequate housing, or was using emergency accommodation or a refuge; the literacy and language skills of the person; an illness, impairment or condition of the person that requires treatment, including an illness that is episodic or unpredictable in nature; a cognitive or neurological impairment of the person; a psychiatric or psychological impairment or mental illness of the person; a drug or alcohol dependency of the person; unforeseen family or caring responsibilities of the person; that the person was subjected to criminal violence (including domestic violence and sexual assault); that the person was adversely affected by the death of an immediate family member or close relative; and, the person's recent imprisonment or release from imprisonment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has argued that some of the above factors will still be considered in determining 'reasonable excuse'. However, on the government's proposal, job seekers would have to prove that the circumstances directly prevented them from meeting the requirement and that they gave prior notice, under the requirements of section 42UA of the act. The secretary will no longer be required to take the above factors into consideration when deciding whether a job seeker has a reasonable excuse. The department is going to be handing responsibility for the decision making as to whether or not a serious failure has occurred and whether or not there was a reasonable excuse for it from Centrelink to Job Services Australia and to their provider staff. The major concern with this is that the JSA staff may not be aware that they have a wide discretion in making a decision as the delegate of the secretary and might instead be led to believe that they can only consider the factors listed under 'reasonable excuse' in the government's new determination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's own <span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">xposure draft for employment services 2015-2020 purchasing arrangements</span> states on page 41: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Employment Provider will also determine whether the Job Seeker had a reasonable excuse for non-attendance at their initial appointment in accordance with legislation and guidelines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This clearly demonstrates that what the minister was arguing is false, that what the minister was arguing is not correct. The providers themselves who have looked at this package of legislation—not just the determination—have expressed concern in relation to these changes, including that it will change the dynamic of the relationship between job seeker and provider, with the provider becoming—to use one of the PM's famous terms—the baddie. They do not want that, but that is what this package of legislation does and that is why we must disallow this determination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobs Australia has further concerns. One of their key considerations is the fact that the department will be handing responsibility for decision making from Centrelink staff to Job Services Australia provider staff. What level of guidance and support will be provided no-one yet knows, but one concern arising from that is that the JSA staff may not be made aware that they have wide discretion in making a decision as delegates of the secretary. They might instead be led to believe that they can only consider the factors listed in the determination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who knows what the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Job Seeker Compliance Framework) Bill will seek to do. It is part of an attack package on the most vulnerable Australians. Obviously, the government thinks that the harsh measures so far have not gone far enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed Newstart changes demonise young job seekers. They punish job seekers for not being able to find work rather than focusing on job creation so that there are actually jobs out there for people. The changes force them to live on fresh air for a continuing six-month cycle. The government wants them to find it so hard that they do not bother with income support. This is a cost-cutting approach using the most vulnerable people in this country. Not only will job seekers have to fall back on parents and families, if they have parents and families; they will have to fall back on charity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This determination is one aspect of big picture of this government's action today in this area. I emphasise that you cannot deal with the determination in isolation from the other aspects of the government's social security attack measures. It is all about punishing and further disadvantaging vulnerable people who are already doing it tough. Yesterday when I was outlining the issues associated with this determination, I went to the statement of compatibility with human rights. One of the key bills that this determination will integrate with is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill 2014. What did the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights say about it? It said this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Based on the information and analysis provided the committee does not consider that the statement of compatibility adequately demonstrates that the proposed amendments are needed for the purpose of meeting a pressing and substantial concern, that there is a rational connection between the measure and the identified objective and that the measure is a reasonable and proportionate one for the achievement of that objective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was scrutiny of the parliament. The joint human rights committee have said that the bill is not reasonable and it is not proportionate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you are looking at this determination, you have to take into account the other aspects of the draconian legislation against the poor and needy in this country. I do not understand for a minute how this could happen or how people could treat their fellow Australians in this manner. When you take all of those bills and this determination together, we are penalising people who are surviving on $36 a day. You must look at the whole package that is in place so that you understand the implications of the determination. This is a horrible set of measures against the poor, the underprivileged and the weakest people in our community. It simply shows that this government is completely out of touch. It is completely out of touch with the needs of the unemployed in the country, it is completely out of touch with the availability of work for the unemployed in this country, it is completely out of touch with the challenges that the unemployed face and it simply ignores the already tough set of measures that are there to ensure compliance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one wants people to rort the system, but this is not designed to stop people rorting the system; this is an ideological attack on the poorest people in the country. It is an ideological attack because the coalition do not have a clue what it is like to be unemployed or have one of your family unemployed. They do not know what it is like to battle to put food on the table on $36 a day. They think you need to impose more penalties on the poorest people in this country. We should not support this determination. By supporting this determination, you are basically saying the package of bills is okay. The package of bills is not okay. We need a decent society and we need a package of bills that looks after the poorest and does not penalise them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  In speaking to the second reading of the Corporations Amendment (Simple Corporate Bonds and Other Measures) Bill 2014, I indicate that Labor will be supporting this bill and that Labor supports the establishment of a retail corporate bond market in Australia. A well-performing and efficient retail corporate bond market will provide an alternative source of funding for Australian companies and increase competitive pressure on lending rates to businesses. This bond market is a significant source of funds for many Australian financial and non-financial corporations. Correspondingly, this financing activity provides investment opportunities for Australians and non-residents. Indeed, the establishment of a deep and liquid retail corporate bond market in Australia was a key priority for the former Labor government and was subject to some significant and ongoing work over a number of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 26 September 2008, the Minister for Financial Services, Mr Bowen, established the Australian Financial Centre Forum, the AFCF, to progress the government's initiative to position Australia as a leading financial services centre in the region. Mr Mark Johnson was the chairman of this partnership of government and industry, which also comprised six senior financial sector representatives, a Treasury task force and a reference group. The AFCF looked at a broad range of policy settings including, but not limited to, financial sector regulation; taxation; improving Australia's skill and talent pool through education and immigration policies; and promotion of Australia's financial services industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The final report, known colloquially as the Johnson report and formally as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia as a financial centre: building on our strengths </span>report was handed down in November 2009 and included examination of the lack of liquidity and diversity in Australia's corporate bond market. It also discussed why this lack of liquidity was a significant weakness in the overall assessment of Australia's financial system. At the retail level, it was considered that one action the government could take to overcome this weakness was to introduce regulatory changes that could assist with developing the market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In December 2010, as part of its Competitive and Sustainable Banking System initiative, the former Labor government signalled it would be introducing changes to facilitate the development of a deeper and more liquid corporate bond market in Australia. These changes included launching the trading of Commonwealth government securities on financial markets to be accessible to retail investors and reducing the regulatory burden associated with issuing corporate bonds to retail investors, including streamlining disclosure requirements and prospectus liability regulations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that is before the Senate today seeks to reduce the regulatory burden of companies offering relatively simple, or so-called 'vanilla', corporate bonds to retail investors, while at the same time ensuring that appropriate standards of consumer protection are maintained. The bill increases offerings of corporate bonds to retail investors in Australia by streamlining the disclosure regime for issuers; changing the civil liability regime in respect to retail corporate bonds; and clarifying the application of the requirement to take 'reasonable steps' in respect of misleading and deceptive statements and omissions in disclosure documents relating to retail corporate bonds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill follows the passage of the former Labor government's legislation to facilitate retail trading in Commonwealth government securities, CGS, in 2012. Having an active retail market in Commonwealth government securities is an important step in establishing a wider retail corporate bonds market by providing a visible pricing benchmark for retail investors in corporate bonds. This bill will deliver on the former Labor government's commitment to reduce regulatory burdens and barriers for offers of corporate bonds to retail investors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains three major elements. First, under current arrangements, the issuance of corporate bonds to retail investors requires the provision of a full prospectus. Under the changes in this bill, the issuance of certain corporate bonds to retail investors will require the provision of a two-part simple corporate bond prospectus. Second, under current arrangements, simple retail corporate bonds, like other bonds, can be traded directly but are not able to be traded as depository interests. Under this bill, simple corporate bonds will be able to be traded using simple retail corporate bonds depository interests. Third, under current arrangements, directors and proposed directors of a body making an offer have liability for any misstatement in, or omission from, the disclosure document whether or not that director was involved in a contravention of subsection 728(1). This bill makes changes so that directors and proposed directors of a body making an offer have liability for any misstatement in, or omission from, the disclosure document only where they are involved in a contravention of subsection 728(1).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor had introduced the Corporations Amendment (Simple Corporate Bonds and Other Measures) Bill 2013 which lapsed. Schedule 1 of that bill is virtually identical to the bill we are debating today. There is one minor change between schedule 1 of Labor's 2013 bill, which lapsed, and proposed section 713A paragraph 22 of the new bill. The old bill specified that securities must be for a fixed term of not more than 10 years. This has been changed to a fixed term of not more than 15 years in the new bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measures in this new bill are another major initiative that the former Labor government was delivering on in its long-term commitment to encourage the development of a deep and liquid bond market in Australia. The measures provide companies with another source of fundraising and signal that it is their time to contribute to the development of Australia's corporate bond market. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We often hear much rhetoric from those on the opposite side of the chamber about red tape and regulation. Here is an example of good measures of the former Labor government to reduce red tape and the regulatory burden. We are pleased that the new government has continued the good work of Labor in office and, with that, Labor will be supporting this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I will not take long with this second reading contribution on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Classification Tools and Other Measures) Bill because we are dealing with non-controversial business and there has been significant discussion of this bill in the House. However, I can indicate that Labor is supporting the bill and we welcome the government's progressing the matter. The former Labor government did all the work to enable the bill and to formulate the approach taken in its provisions. It was Labor that asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake a review of Australia's classification and censorship system—remarkably, the first such review in 20 years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also the former Labor government that took the recommendations of that report to the Standing Council on Law and Justice in April 2013, and it was Labor that secured the agreement of state and territory ministers, which has now borne fruit here with this bill. So, we welcome the fact that the government is proceeding with the bill and I indicate Labor's hearty support.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  I chaired the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs  Legislation Committee inquiry that looked at the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Classification Tools and Other Measures) Bill in some detail, and I want to thank those who made submissions and those who appeared before us to give evidence. I also want to thank the committee secretariat for again doing a wonderful job in coordinating and bringing together the thoughts of the committee and its recommendations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Generally there was consensus that the National Classification Scheme is in need of reform, and various stakeholders welcomed the bill. There were a number of issues raised which are set out in the report. I urge the Attorney-General and his department to carefully consider some of the issues raised. I do congratulate Senator Brandis for bringing this bill forward—as I say, there was a general belief that amendments and reform were necessary, and I am pleased that Senator Brandis has acted on that. I would refer Senator Brandis and his department to the recommendations of the committee. The first recommendation is that the bill be passed, which I know the Attorney will take note of, and the second recommendation states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee recommends that the government ensures that the Bill's implementation and supporting material are clear and understood by stakeholders, in particular information regarding the approval and trial of classification tools, and the appeals process</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People did ask us about those issues during the hearing. There was clearly a need for a little extra explanation or clarification, and I hope that the department in implementing this bill will take notice of that recommendation. This is not a party partisan bill—I think all parties to the hearing were happy to recommend the bill's passing but we do ask that the government take some account of the issues raised in the committee's report.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  Labor will support the Meteorology Amendment (Online Advertising) Bill, which gives effect to decisions taken under the previous Labor government. The Bureau of Meteorology is an Australian institution, providing valuable information on weather and weather patterns all the year round, as well as vital updates on information during extreme weather events—something we all very much value. It helps us make decisions like whether to take an umbrella as we leave the house, right through to when we plant crops and when to move out of the path of a devastating cyclone. Its services help families and individuals right through to emergency services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bureau is also vital to our economy—some 3.4 per cent of Australia's GDP is climate sensitive, covering almost every economic sector. The aviation industry alone is heavily reliant on the bureau's services. There are around 1.7 million passenger movements every single week, and every single service is reliant on accurate weather forecasting services. We do know there is always room for improvement, and the review of the bureau's extreme weather and seasonal forecasting capacity—known as the Munro review—was undertaken in response to extreme weather events in the 2010-11 summer. Senators will recall the events of the 2010-11 summer—there was severe flooding, there were several intense tropical cyclones and there were bushfires in Western Australia. Again in the summer of 2012-13 we had heatwaves and Tropical Cyclone Oswald </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bureau's services also worked on providing potential tsunami warnings as a result of earthquakes across the Pacific.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During these times of intense activity, the bureau's capacity was stretched and tested. These capacity issues are still likely to be tested by climate change as it increases the severity of extreme weather events. The then Labor government's initial response was quick. Funding was provided to retain international meteorologists and recruit and train graduate meteorologists. The Munro review also recommended that advertising be considered as an option for raising revenue, so Labor acted on the recommendation by announcing a 12-month trial in 2012-13 and advertising became a permanent feature of the bureau website in the 2013 budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bureau of Meteorology had over 500 million visits in 2013. It is one of the most visited websites in Australia. From these half a billion visits, almost three billion pages of information were downloaded. Allowing the bureau to place paid advertising on its website, with the right safeguards, will allow it to cover some of the costs of its operations. I think it is also worth remembering that the bureau would not be the first national forecasting service to carry paid advertising. It is already done in Canada, the UK, New Zealand, France and Denmark. We are not entering uncharted territory at all here. It is already done in other countries and it has been trialled here in Australia. This bill formalises the ability of the Bureau of Meteorology to place paid advertising and ensures that guidelines are in place so that advertising is appropriate. Labor is a strong supporter of the bureau and supports measures that increase its capacity to serve the Australian people and the Australian economy. We believe this bill serves this end and therefore Labor will be supporting this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I will speak briefly on the Meteorology Amendment (Online Advertising) Bill 2014. As Senator Singh has acknowledged, the bureau is one of the most widely respected and visited sources in the country, whether you are checking the app on your mobile phone or the website to see if you need an umbrella or not on that day. Indeed, you might not be aware that they are the source for the TV news every night. From that ordinary sense all the way through to the fact that the bureau does critically important research on longer term climate impacts on Australia, I think it is important to note at the outset that this is a widely respected and trusted institution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware from my work in a slightly different context over the years with SBS of the idea that publicly funded, available, trusted broadcasting services be compelled to take advertising—which is something that, fortunately, has not crossed over to the ABC yet, although we know that that is being discussed behind closed doors. At least in the context of SBS, forcing the Special Broadcasting Service to take advertising was simply an excuse, once it had been worked out roughly how much the agency would be able to raise, to withdraw public funding and to make it more difficult for the SBS to carry out its deeply important role. What I see occurring with the extension and normalisation of advertising that will be carried on the Bureau of Meteorology's site, is creeping commercialisation allowing government to gradually abandon and withdraw responsibility for funding a service that all Australians, whether they know it or not, deeply depend on from the day-to-day mundane all the way through to the critically important enabling research and modelling on what our climate is doing. In forcing an entity like the bureau to run advertising on its web presence—which, as Senator Singh has acknowledged, has a lot of eyeballs, presence and reach—although it obviously boosts the fortunes of the bureau, we will find the Australian government removing a dollar for every dollar that is raised in advertising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, we have commercialised something that should have remained free from those influences. As was noted at SBS—and it would be interesting to consider how the bureau might respond—the SBS changes its programming, ethic and the way it thinks about its role if it is effectively chasing eyeballs. When you begin to advertise, effectively your audience and viewership becomes a commodity that you sell to advertisers. It is a very different way of thinking than when your customer is the people of Australia, who rely on you for reliable weather services and climate research. I do not think the case has been made at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been listed as non-controversial legislation. I would like to put on record on behalf of the Australian Greens that for us it is procedurally non-controversial in that we do not intend to call a division, because we understand the government and the opposition have called in favour, but I think this prospect is one of controversy. We should not simply let through to the keeper the idea that government can withdraw responsibility for a service like this, pulling funding from the BOM, while encouraging it to become some kind of commercial broadcaster on behalf of advertisers. I know the context of SBS is somewhat different, that SBS is a broadcaster and broadcasters sometimes carry advertising. This is a profoundly important public service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens next? Will we have the health department advertising pharmaceutical products? I do not mean that in a glib or a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. Is that where this is heading? I think it is a very dangerous path for us to be going down. On the one hand is the fact that it means the government can reduce its responsibility for funding something that is very important; on the other hand, is the way that these kinds of commercial imperatives—which are entirely appropriate for private companies as opposed to government essential services—can warp the priorities of the agency itself. That is what I think we should be extremely careful of here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are quite disappointed to see the bipartisan cross-party support on behalf of Labor and the coalition for normalising something that I think we should apply some critical thinking to in order to see how much further down this curve the government proposes to go. I guess Senator Mason is going to rise to speak on this bill, on behalf of the government. I would be interested to hear from you, Senator Mason, on your behalf, whether this is something we are likely to see for other government online presences. Are they—</span>

                    </a>  Well, you have some advisers in the box next to you. I understand that you are in a representative capacity here, that this is not your portfolio. But I would be interested to know: today the Bureau of Meteorology, yesterday SBS—who is it going to be tomorrow, and where is this going to take us? I am recording now that the Greens will not be calling a division, but we do oppose this bill and we think some critical thinking should be applied to the whole concept.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I do support the Meteorology Amendment (Online Advertising) Bill 2014. As Senator Ludlam mentioned, the Bureau of Meteorology has a very, very valuable product—a product that is much in demand. I have always had the view that some of the great work the bureau does should be converted into a cash return to the taxpayer for the enormous amount of money the taxpayer has put into the bureau over a period of very many years. So, I certainly support the bill. I once had the privilege of being the minister in charge of the bureau, and I remember that even back in those days we were always trying to find ways that we could sell the wonderful product that the bureau produces to save the taxpayer the complete 100 per cent investment in the bureau, which does become more difficult to fund each and every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bureau has a wonderful reputation, and I well recall my happy years interacting very closely with the bureau. I remember some wonderful people there, including Mr Bill Kininmonth. Talking about Mr Bill Kininmonth just reminds me—slightly off the subject, but certainly relating to the bureau—that I saw a letter in one of the papers the other day from Mr Kininmonth about a recent controversy with the bureau. As I said, I have a very high regard for the bureau, but there is a scientist who has recently been doing some work on what is called the harmonisation of temperature readings. Unfortunately, I am not terribly well prepared for this speech, and I do not even have the name of the scientist who raised some concerns about the bureau's harmonisation of temperature. As I always say—and Senator Ludlam will well agree—I am no expert in this field and in fact am just an ordinary member of the public reading reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as I understand it, there are a couple of places in Australia where the same temperature recording instruments have been used for decades and decades. One of them was Amberley in Queensland. These recordings show that the temperature is actually dropping, not increasing. There is not global warming in these couple of instances. Rather, those instruments—the same ones that have always been there—are showing that the temperature is falling. As I understand it, this scientist has done a lot of research and she has actually worked out that the bureau was not prepared to accept this one reading from Amberley and another place that was mentioned—I have forgotten what it is—but did what they call harmonising, which means that they take that temperature reading and harmonise it with other recordings around the area. And in this case, according to this researcher, it was not even near the area, near Amberley. This scientist raised the question of why the Bureau of Meteorology—someone as respectable and responsible as that—would be engaged in this harmonisation when, as I understand it, they did not need to, because it was the same instrument that was used. I understand from these reports that harmonisation is for where you have one sort of measuring device but then change it. And because there can be changes in devices you sometimes get different readings, which they then harmonise. But why you would harmonise when it was the same recording instrument is the question that has arisen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the bureau has refuted that publicly and has given an explanation, but I noticed quite a number of letters to the editor that share my concern about the fact that there needs to be ongoing debate on the cause of climate change—the human induced carbon emissions that so many talk about. As one of the letters—or perhaps even this research—said, it is very clear that with peer reviewed research it is the peer reviewers who, like the initial researcher, are getting grants from governments time in, time out. And dare I say, without defaming them, that they have another interest, in making sure that this global warming debate is there. It always concerns me that if you are like this independent researcher, having a different view, or like Professor Bob Carter, having a different view, then you are pilloried. I am surprised that the Greens have not catcalled as they usually do when I mention any scientist who does not conform with the standard IPCC view on life of man induced global warming.</span>

                    </a>  Senator Cameron would do well to not embark upon this thing. Just because people do not agree with you, Senator Cameron, it does not mean that they are to be discarded or pilloried, as happens in the climate change debate. That is the concern. I suspect this independent researcher—and I apologise to her for not having her name, but I think it is Dr Marohasy—will be suffering an attack from her own class of scientist for the views she has so courageously published. I am not for a moment suggesting she is right. As I always say in these debates, as an amateur I really cannot get into the debate. But I read with interest that there are qualified scientists and researchers with equally good qualifications and learning who do not follow the IPCC view on man-induced global warming. It always makes me very well aware that in spite of what the Greens and the Labor Party and other politically correct groups say, the debate is far from over. There is no universal understanding of what I call the Greens view or the IPCC view. I raise it in the context of the bureau, and again repeat my highest admiration for the bureau. But I do mention bureau scientists of the past who have different views, but who, when they raised them, were disregarded, as Senator Cameron tries to disregard me. It does not worry me, and I am sure it will not worry this rather courageous researcher who has put her work out to the public in the last seven days, I think it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good that it is there so the debate can go on. Unfortunately, because I am chairing another committee, these days I do not get the opportunity to go to the Senate environment committee, where I could ask the bureau these questions, which is a shame. But I would like to engage with the bureau as to why they have harmonised data where there did not seem there would be a case for harmonisation. As I said, I have read that the bureau gives a different view, but this very courageous scientist has clearly got support from other scientists and researchers. I say to the bureau: do not get tied up in the political argument that has been promoted by the former government. I can well understand why the bureau was very much in favour of that line under the former government, because I know that if anyone in the bureau had had a different view to the Gillard/Rudd government, they would have been sacked on the spot or pushed out, and I can understand that. But I say to the bureau now that they are under the control of a government that does allow free speech, that does encourage diversity of view. Senator Cameron reminds me that I am one of those who sometimes do have a diverse view on different things than my own party and my own government do—unlike the Labor Party, who are not allowed to do that. But we have a government that does allow a difference of opinion, and I say to the bureau for what it is worth, and out of respect for them from the time when I worked closely with them: do not get drawn into the politics of these things. Be careful with your research and your reputation. I would urge the bureau to seriously consider some of the work that has been put forward by this very courageous independent scientist-researcher that I refer to. Unlike Senator Ludlam, I do think this is a good idea for the bureau that the online advertising be enabled to give the bureau additional resources. I certainly support the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  I rise to oppose the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill 2014. This is another example of how unfair this government is—how unfair it is to those who are the most vulnerable in society. How incompetent this government is. If the government had the least bit of competence or understanding about the real issues to try and deal with unemployment, they would not be going down this path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It shows how arrogant this government is that it would allow its ideology to dominate any common-sense approach to dealing with unemployed Australians. Remember: these are our most vulnerable Australians. Thirty-six dollars a day they are surviving on—I would not call it 'living'; they are surviving on $36 a day. Yet this government wants to treat the unemployed as dole bludgers: 'They should not be there; they should be out in gainful employment'! This is the ideology of a coalition who are really so far removed from the reality of unemployment that they cannot make basic legislative frameworks that understand the needs of the unemployed in this country. All they want to do is to implement penal provisions. We have seen already today that this Senate has looked askance at the penal provisions that this government wants to put in place. What we did earlier today was to disallow a regulation that was part of the framework of attacks on unemployed Australians in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, the problem for the coalition is that Minister Andrews, who has carriage of this for the coalition, just does not seem to understand the complexities of dealing with unemployment in Australia. If you deal with unemployment on the basis of saying to companies like Toyota and General Motors: 'We don't want you; we don't need you; we're not going to co-invest; you can go away,' and they go away, what basis is that for having any understanding of the real issues on jobs?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said many times, I just cannot understand why the South Australian senators do not do what other coalition South Australian senators have done in the past and actually stand up for their state and stand up for jobs. I have never seen such a weak-kneed, lily-livered, jelly-backed approach from coalition senators in my life. We have had all these debates about jobs in South Australia. We have had all these debates about how we maintain an industry based on manufacturing in South Australia. And I do not think I have heard a contribution from the South Australian senators. I was not a great fan of some of the previous coalition senators, but I will tell you: they would have been in there arguing for jobs. They would have been arguing for their state. They would not have been wanting to turn South Australia into a pale imitation of the United States, with all the social and economic problems that we see there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill that is before us now I think demonstrates the lack of politicians in the coalition's ranks that are prepared to stand up for jobs, because all they seem to want to do is to run this ideological line, this American Tea Party line, that what you do is you punish those who cannot get a job—punish those who cannot get a job! And, as with the Republican Party in the United States, I think we are rapidly seeing the Australian public recognise this—the same as the United States public recognise that you cannot trust the Republicans in the United States with jobs and you cannot trust them to make decent, fair policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the Tea Party fanatics in the coalition. We know they are there; we have seen them in action. And this bill is about saying, 'We don't care about the unemployed; we can fix unemployment by forcing people into a job.' How do you force people into jobs if the jobs are not there? How do you force people into jobs if the government has got absolutely no idea about how to develop a jobs policy in this country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be less embarrassing for the South Australian senators if they actually stood up against their own party and said: 'You've got it wrong on jobs; you've got it wrong on fairness; you've got it wrong on equity. We should take the words of Brian Loughnane and not be so ideological, otherwise we are doomed.' The South Australians have got an opportunity to actually do something about unemployment, and I would hope that, when this bill goes to a vote, the South Australian senators actually get a backbone—that they stop being jelly-backs; that they actually stand up for their state and say, 'We will not simply penalise South Australians who are going to face the problems with this bill more than those in most other states.' South Australian senators have an opportunity to actually stand up for their state and vote against this bill, on the basis that it does nothing for jobs and it does nothing for South Australians who are looking for jobs. It is about an ideological obsession of the coalition's. It is wrong in policy, it is wrong in equity and it has no basis in social fairness at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I will be watching carefully those jelly-backed, lily-livered South Australian senators when it comes to this issue, and coalition senators from other states, like the Tasmanian senators who are going to impose this draconian legislation on Tasmanians as well. Because where are the highest areas of unemployment? South Australia and Tasmania. That is not to say we do not have unemployment problems elsewhere; we certainly do. But there is an opportunity now for those who are not Tea Party extremists in South Australia, for those who want to look after South Australians and, by extension, all those in this country who are doing it tough—those people surviving on $36 a day, who do not know where the next meal is coming from, who, under this package of legislative changes that the coalition want to bring in, will be facing six months with no income. How about creating an underclass in this country! That is what the coalition are doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose, if you were a Tea Party supporter, you would not care about that. You would not really worry as long as the market is operating effectively, as long as your business is allowed to operate how it likes. Exploit workers if you want. Get any of those externalities out of the way of business—so, no union involvement, no collective bargaining, no decency, no underpinning of a decent social safety net for Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the position that this coalition proposes. Was anyone aware of this before the last election? Of course we were not. The Australian public were lied to; they were lied to by the coalition. They lied about their welfare policies. They lied about their jobs policies. They lied about their environmental policies. They lied about every policy of substance. They said there would be no cutbacks to pensions, and there are. They said there would be no increases in taxes, and there are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government based on ideology. It is about ideology; it is not about the national interest. For the coalition, when it comes to ideology versus the national interest, the national interest comes a long way second—because where is it in the national interest to say to our fellow Australians, 'You will not be allowed to have any income for six months?'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are some people of goodwill in the coalition; there are some people of goodwill. I just wonder whether they will look at this legislation and take the same view as the experts in unemployment, the people who study this for a living, the academics who look at this and say, 'This is crazy; these penal provisions do not work.' Will they support the reality of this academic analysis? Will they support St Vincent de Paul, The Smith Family, the welfare rights groups? Or will they simply say, 'You get people back to work by starving them into a job'? I hope that is not the case, but I am afraid we have not seen much sign that the coalition can be trusted, that they will deal with anyone fairly and that they will not take an ideological approach to what they are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the estimates hearings, I asked questions of the Department of Human Services. I live out in the lower Blue Mountains, near Penrith. There are many unemployed people in Penrith. There are many families doing it tough not only in Penrith but in the western suburbs generally. Where are the bulk of the unemployed in my state of New South Wales? They are in the outer suburbs and they are in rural and regional Australia. And what does this bill do for the residents of Western Sydney and the residents of rural and regional Australia who happen to be unemployed? It says to them, 'Unless you "earn or learn"'—another slogan, another ideological beat-up—'you will have no income for six months.' Where is there a place for this type of ideology in a modern economy? Where is there any place for this in a society that has some compassion and caring for our fellow Australians? </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no compassion and no caring from this rabble of a government over there—no compassion and no caring from this mob over there.

                    </a>  Give us a break! The National Party have got electorates where there is massive unemployment, massive youth unemployment. But what do the doormats of the coalition do? They sit quietly and do nothing. They allow the coalition to rip away at the hospital system in rural and regional Australia. They allow them to rip away at the education system in rural and regional Australia. No wonder the National Party are described as doormats. When I first came here I said, 'No, the National Party can't be doormats!' But I was here a couple of days and I knew the National Party were the doormats of the coalition—the absolute doormats! But under that doormat you now find the South Australian senators. They are even worse than a doormat. Lift that doormat up and out scuttle the South Australian senators! It is pretty awful, I have got to tell you. But National Party senators, do not feel too bad. Senator Edwards will scuttle out from under that doormat and you will know that he is even more jelly-backed than you lot in the National Party!</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  The Greens wall be opposing the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill. We believe this is yet another of the government's ideological attacks on those seeking to find work. Of course, the regulation that we have just disallowed—we had the discussion on it earlier today and last night—was part of that attack on job seekers. As St Vincent de Paul Society Chief Executive Officer John Falzon said to the inquiry, there are so many reasons why people find themselves on the pathway to despair instead of the pathway to employment. This is clearly what the government does not understand. They think people do not find a job because they do not want to find a job. They do not understand that it is not because they cannot find work. They think it is because they make that choice. They think people make a lifestyle choice. Well, they don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is not interested in addressing the many barriers that people who rely on income support experience when trying to find work. Instead, the government chooses to punish and humiliate these people, seemingly at every turn in their lives. This unrelenting punishment and demonisation of people trying to find work, in itself, provides another barrier for people who are trying to find work, another disincentive to work. Virtually everybody, except the department, who made a submission to the inquiry into this bill did not support it. Ms O'Halloran, who is the President of the National Welfare Rights Network, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our network opposes the introduction of the bill before you, fundamentally on the ground that we question the purpose of the bill—whether it is actually to punish people or to help people into paid work. We would think that we would all be united in the view that helping a person who is unemployed into paid work would be the goal and we do not believe that this bill will achieve that goal. In fact, we think it will be counterproductive. That is based on our casework experience, real life lived caseload experience, with the heavy penalty system introduced in 2006 and the many changes to that system since that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is winding back the promises that the Rudd government made to the absolutely horrendous Welfare to Work regime that the Howard government brought in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night Senator Abetz tried to conflate the two discussions about the regulation we disallowed today and this particular bill. He accused me of referring to this bill rather than the regulation. He obviously had not read his own government's explanatory memorandum on the regulation as opposed to this particular bill. Although, I will say that the explanation of the regulation had a very similar statement of compatibility with human rights. The one that I am addressing is, of course, about this particular bill and, coincidently, it uses the same flawed argument about compatibility with human rights. It notes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill engages the right to work, the right to social security, and the right to an adequate standard of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It uses the same sort of ridiculous excuse for demonising and punishing people because they had a right to work. The Human Rights Committee noted the measures of the bill that remove and limit the ability to waive the non-payment period for refusal of suitable work or persistent noncompliance, and it does say, 'may limit' the right to social security, the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to equality and non-discrimination'. The Human Rights Committee expressed concerns that, notwithstanding the assurances in the explanatory memorandum, it remains:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… unclear how limiting the availability of a waiver on the ground of a jobseeker’s severe financial hardship, or because a jobseeker agrees to undertake more intensive activities, such as Work for the Dole, would achieve the stated objective of the measures.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">as promoting the right to work by providing 'a stronger incentive to accept an offer of suitable work', is not an accurate assessment of the limitation on human rights …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee suggested that the bill also has the potential, disproportionately or unintentionally, to impact negatively upon particular groups resulting in the engagement or limitation of the rights to equality and non-discrimination. This is from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and they have found that there are significant issues. I also note that the Community Affairs Committee reported on this legislation just this week, but the minister had not responded to that particular point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does have an impact on job seekers. It has a negative impact on job seekers. A decision to take away all of someone's income support is very serious and can have catastrophic impacts on people's lives. This is another part of a calculated, cruel attack on job seekers and those on income support. It is harsh and, of course, as many of the government's other measures will do, it impacts disproportionately and heavily on the most vulnerable people in our community. But, of course, the government know that because this is part of the approach they are taking through the budget. It is quite obvious that their approach is to demonise, to punish and to be harsh on the most vulnerable in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have this flawed thinking that, if you take harsh approach and push and push the most vulnerable, those that are trying to find work, they will suddenly see the light and think that a job is a good idea. There are hundreds and thousands of people anxiously looking for work. There are only just under 150,000 available jobs currently. So, no matter how much you push and punish people, take away their rights and seek to have stronger penalties, you will not be able to encourage people into jobs that just are not there. This will simply make life harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the people who are at the coalface of working with the most disadvantaged and pick up the pieces as a result of the government's flawed policy approach say, as Ms O'Halloran said: 'It is counterproductive.' As Dr Mestan said as part of the Community Affairs Committee inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Worse than ineffectual, the policy is likely to be counterproductive because, once a person is sanctioned, they have no incentive to meet requirements, whereas in the current regime, where payments are recommenced upon compliance, there is a strong incentive for a sanctioned person to quickly meet requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the concern that the Greens have is that the longer people are disconnected with the system the harder it is for them to re-engage. Surely that is what we want. We actually want people who make a mistake to be able to re-engage with the system and to be able to then continue with their participation plans, which they will have worked out. Dr Mestan said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the main aim does not seem to be to get people into employment. I feel it can be counterproductive. It could prevent people from getting employment, because they will be sanctioned even if they try to re-engage in intensive activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill discourages people from re-entering the system quickly, which we know is much better and will lead to much more positive outcomes. This bill is unnecessary, particularly if the government were looking at a more incentives based approach and if it were genuinely addressing the barriers that people are facing to employment. They just are not. This bill assumes that everybody can get a job if they just look hard enough, if they just try that little bit harder. People are trying to find work, but, as I said, the jobs are not available for those people. So, the government are punishing people simply for not being able to find a job. Stronger penalties for people that cannot find work will not help people engage with the system if there are no jobs to be found.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the problem that we have with this bill is the cumulative effects of all the changes that are coming under both the budget and other measures that the government are bringing in. We are desperately concerned that the most vulnerable Australians already face many barriers to employment, and remember that they are living in poverty. They are living on Newstart. If you are under 25 you are living on Youth Allowance. You live on less than $36 a day on Newstart. If you are living on Youth Allowance you are living on less than that. Here you have a group of extremely vulnerable Australians who are living on less than $36 a day. They are trying to meet all their requirements and they are trying to exist in poverty. Poverty itself is a barrier to employment. These people are the ones that we are talking about who will be subject to these stronger penalties because they potentially may make a misstep. This bill takes away the ability for the penalties to be waived. We do not think that is good policy.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, Senator Johnston is not a comrade; he is a brother to me, and I am delighted to see Senator Johnston working with this government to try to achieve the very best outcome. It stands to reason that the Senate, which is the states house, will from time to time have people championing their specific state. However, the government's view—and that is what I was seeking to express prior to Senator Moore's point of order—in this area is very clear, and question time is usually devoted to matters of government and government policy, not to my personal views on somebody else's personal views.</span>

I say to the honourable senator that this decision was made on the back of me as minister and the department to make some judgements about what expenditure we are going to put into various areas over the next four years. I think it is a pity that the shadow minister, who was talking about this being a $10 million program, is clearly not across his brief, clearly knows absolutely nothing about this and was actually talking about this in the context of a budget cut.

Now, more than a decade after the Australian government followed the United States and United Kingdom in the coalition of the willing into the 2003 Iraq war without consultation with the Australian parliament and without a statement of Australia's national interest, resulting in the deaths of almost 5,000 coalition troops and over 100,000 civilians, can the minister point to the lessons that the Prime Minister has learnt from that decision that he will now apply in the current situation, with the United States again reportedly considering seeking Australian participation in a coalition of the willing for military action in Iraq and Syria?</span>

That the Australian Greens would seek to make politics out of such an ugly situation where we have seen pictures on social media of an Australian and his young child holding a severed head is regrettable. I think every person who believes in civilisation and in genuine peace and freedom would be highly alert to this evil force that is in play in Syria and Iraq not being allowed to get a greater foothold. Indeed, the lessons of history are that, when you see such an untold evil such as is occurring in Iraq and Syria, if you do not seek to stop it in its tracks you will have greater problems in the future, with greater loss of life.

However, the reality in the world is that, from time to time, military action may be required. Whether it is or is not in these circumstances, I am not going to seek to pre-empt. The relevant authorities and the relevant responsible people will make that decision, if it needs to be made, in due course after taking every single possible factor into account. Can I simply say that under our constitution the Governor-General is in charge of our defence forces. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In matters of conflict it would not necessarily be the smartest thing to have a fortnight or three weeks of debate, if you were to go down that track, in hypothetical circumstances, and tell the enemy: 'Guess what? We're going to have a discussion here as to whether we're going to put a tank here or an aeroplane there, and the Senate is going to amend how many trucks we're going to have.' I think we will leave that up to the military strategists and those that genuinely put their lives on the line for our safety, our peace and our security.</span>

Yes, Senator Collins, you are absolutely correct that the government has no intentions of collecting a person's web-surfing history. The instruction that we have given to those who are preparing legislation makes it clear that we have no intention of asking for that material to be collected. As I explained to Senator Ludlam when he asked about this matter yesterday, we are not asking for any additional powers for the agencies in relation to metadata, nor are we asking the telecoms providers and the ISPs to do anything beyond what they currently do. But we are concerned that with changing business practices, and in particular changing practices in relation to business records, there may be a degradation of capacity, which is why the government, on 5 August, made an in-principle decision to mandate for the retention of metadata. You have to distinguish entirely, Senator Collins, between that requirement and the legislation to provide the agencies with new powers. That is a separate issue. We are not asking for any additional powers in relation to metadata at all.</span>

They are your words, Minister.

Food security is a national issue and one which the federal government should be protecting and promoting. Since the commencement of the Coles-initiated milk price war in 2011 some 100 dairy farmers in Queensland have been forced to close their businesses. What is the government doing to protect the interests of dairy farmers in Australia?</span>

Whenever the primary sector is faced with drought, there are, of course, very real problems, because they are often price takers; and no matter how hard they work or how efficient they are, they are subject to the vagaries of the weather. That, of course, does put them in some extreme difficulties and that is why, as a government, we do have drought relief policies and other assistance to try to assist the rural community generally.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the dairy farmers per se, I would draw the Leader of the Palmer United Party's attention to the good work of my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Robb. The two free trade agreements that he has been able to negotiate with Japan and South Korea will see a huge surge in export potential for our dairy sector. That helps to create new competitive markets, and it is one of the pillars, if I may say, of our agricultural policy. It is one of our strengths and we are playing to one of those strengths in the dairy sector. In my home state of Tasmania, we are assisting the dairy sector, in a roundabout way, by offering support to Cadburys. An extra 6000 dairy cows will be required for its expansion, which will see an extra 20,000 tonnes of chocolate being exported from Tasmania to South-East Asia.</span>

Given the importance of the dairy farming industry in Australia and the need for Australia to be able to access fresh, high-quality and locally-produced dairy products, it is imperative that the interests of Australian farmers are protected. What is the government doing to address and stop the predatory practices of large and powerful supermarket chains which negotiate unfair and unjust contract with farmers—contracts that clearly undermine the survival and success of Australian farmers?</span>

People are quite right to question that. However, in relation to these operations within the marketplace, it is the view of successive governments that the best approach to these matters is not necessarily to have the ham-fisted approach of government, but to have regulatory authorities undertake the task of ensuring that no undue market pressure is brought to bear. That is why we have the ACCC. Whether the ACCC is performing its tasks sufficiently in that area is a matter of community debate, I understand. It is an appropriate debate in a free country like ours to have matters—<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I would suggest to the good senator that often it is good to get community consultation, to liaise with the community, to ensure that you come to a proper landing on some of these vexed issues. That is what we as a government, from the agriculture and Treasury portfolios, are seeking to do in this space—which is clearly a vexed space—but we want to ensure that there is genuine justice for the dairy farmer, for the retailer and, most importantly, for the consumer. That is the landing we are trying to achieve, and with community consultation and this review we hope we will be able to achieve such an outcome.</span>

This year's event runs from 24 to 30 August with numerous events to be held across Australia. Hearing Awareness Week is celebrated annually and is coordinated by the Deafness Forum of Australia. This year's theme is: 'How loud is too loud?' It is aimed at informing people of how much noise we are exposed to on a daily basis. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An estimated three and a half million Australians are affected by hearing loss to varying degrees, half of whom are working age. This figure is estimated to rise to one quarter of all Australians by 2050. Exposure to noise is a known cause of about one third of the cases of hearing loss, and it makes this year's theme a timely reminder towards prevention. Free information and screening sessions will be held around the country this week to build awareness of the signs and symptoms of hearing loss and the additional health implications. More information about the events being held around Australia can be found on the Hearing Awareness Week website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While hearing loss cannot always be prevented, there are a range of treatment options available that have the potential to improve one's standard of living—in particular, hearing aids. Through the Department of Health we are providing eligible Australians with access to quality and affordable hearing services through the Hearing Services program. The Australian government will invest $424 million this year in the Hearing Services program. Since 1997 1,791,000 clients have registered with the voucher program—with 647,000 clients last year. The program aims to provide eligible Australians with access to hearing services and devices that help them to better manage their hearing loss and maximise their communication ability.</span>

The portal provides clients with faster access to services, enabling them to lodge voucher applications electronically, with the potential to receive services on the same day, which significantly reduces the waiting time for services. The portal also enables hearing service providers to manage many administrative task themselves and eliminates the use of paper forms to streamline the assessment and approval process.</span>

One audiologist remarked to me yesterday that the processing time for application paperwork has been reduced from seven weeks to about 40 seconds, which is improving the service and making sure that people get the help they need sooner.</span>

Considering that today your government released its higher education bill, which if passed would mean that the size of a parent's bank balance will determine a young person's opportunity to study and learn at our public universities, can you confirm if there is a single new student who otherwise would not have enrolled in a bachelor degree at a private higher education provider who will take up their studies as a result of the government's proposed funding changes that were introduced into the House this morning? Can you guarantee that there will be one new student?</span>

I did not quite get the end of the question that Senator Rhiannon asked, but what I can absolutely guarantee to the Senate and Senator Rhiannon is that if the Senate is minded to support the legislation—as the House of Representatives has done and as groups like Universities Australia have encouraged the Senate to do just today, albeit with some amendments—then there will be chances for significantly larger numbers of young Australians to take part in higher education in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the first time, there will be Commonwealth funding for sub-bachelor places in private institutions and for diplomas, associate diplomas and so on. For first time ever we will open up those pathways to increase and encourage greater participation for Australian students. We will provide more choice. We will follow on from the opening up of the demand-driven approach that the previous government adopted to make it demand driven across the entire sector. That is a glaring gap that has been commented on in several reports.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those changes will enable significantly larger numbers of students to participate in higher education in this country. It will give them more choice, it will give them more opportunity and it will give universities a chance to really showcase the sorts of things that they can do through the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, which will also enable larger numbers of students—particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds—to attend our higher education institutions. All of that, as part of this reform package, will bring to Australia's young people, those wishing to study and those who may not otherwise have been able to go to university before the opportunity to follow that path, to follow it across Australia and to follow it with far greater opportunity and choice.</span>

What will happen under deregulation is that universities and other higher education institutions will compete for students. That sort of competition is going to prevent exorbitant fees. We believe that higher education institutions are best placed to determine how to maintain and promote a world-class higher education system. So, from 2016, institutions will be responsible for setting their own levels of student contributions. Frankly, when universities compete for students, students win. They win in terms of the range of courses that offered, they win in terms of the quality of teaching, they win in terms of the quality and diversity of student support they receive and they win in terms of value for money. We can be confident that some fees will go down because we are providing Commonwealth supported places for many courses which were not previously supported. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:48</span>):  I thank Senator Seselja for his question. At the outset I should make clear that the decision to conclude the severe behaviours supplement is not one that the government took lightly. The supplement was introduced by the previous government in August 2013, but as colleagues on this side know and as so often is the case with their decisions, their policies result in cost blow-outs and their policies are very poorly designed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to evidence this, as colleagues may remember, the supplement was budgeted last financial year at $11.7 million. It in fact came out at $110 million—nearly 10 times that which was budgeted. The previous government estimated that 2,000 people would be eligible for the supplement, but as of March 2014 providers were claiming the supplement for more than 25,000 people. If that claiming pattern were continued, projections by the Department of Social Services show that the supplement, rather than costing $52 million over the forward estimates, as the previous government budgeted, would in fact cost $780 million over the forward estimates, and over a 10-year period it would cost $1.5 billion. Therefore, the fact that the supplement was suspended and concluded is fairly and squarely the responsibility of those opposite because of their design. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, the government is committed to working with the sector to find an alternative way to support people with severe behaviour in residential care. The government has been consulting with the sector and there will be a forum held in coming weeks to bring together relevant stakeholders to consider strategies to improve and promote dementia care in residential settings.</span>

It is important to make clear to colleagues that the severe behaviours supplement was never paid directly to people with dementia. It was paid to residential aged-care providers who applied for funding. The supplement was not intended to be a top-up for general dementia care in aged-care settings, nor was it the prime mechanism for funding the care of people with dementia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Funding continues to be available for providers, including for needs associated with dementia, through subsidies determined using the Aged Care Funding Instrument. It is a requirement of Commonwealth funding that each resident receive care of a quality nature appropriate to their needs, and we do remain committed to a range of other assistance for people with dementia. Particularly I should note the $200 million that this government is providing for dementia research.</span>

Obviously, this government is taking a responsible and prudent approach. That is why we ceased the dementia supplement. We are working with the sector to look at what possible well-targeted alternatives there are. There is an alternative approach, and that is what those opposite have announced. If you flick to the ALP website, you can see that they are running a petition for the reinstatement of the previous dementia supplement according to its previous design. Those opposite have not learnt from their mistake, they have not learnt from their design failure, they have not learnt from the budget blow-out for which they are responsible. I wonder what Mr Tony Burke, the Shadow Minister for Finance, thought last time he jumped on the ALP website and he looked there. He would have slapped his forehead and thought, 'What has Senator Polley done? What has Mr Neumann done? What have they committed to?'</span>

                  </a>  I think I may have got the answer. The Department of Finance has commenced a scoping study into the future ownership options for Australian Hearing. That is correct. We, as a government, are committed to ensuring that all eligible Australians, particularly the most vulnerable, have access to funded hearing services. What the government has announced at this time is a scoping study. No decision has been made by the government on the future ownership of Australian Hearing. As anyone who observed the provisions of the budget for 2014-15 would have seen, the Department of Finance was funded in that budget to undertake the scoping study.</span>

A number of issues have been raised with me—and I am sure with the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash, who of course has the Office of Hearing Services in her portfolio responsibilities—by various stakeholders in the portfolio area. As the scoping study itself continues, I am sure that those stakeholders will make those concerns known to the advisers in this area, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Herbert Smith Freehills, and they will also continue to make them known to both myself and the assistant minister in the appropriate ways. I was able to hear from a number of organisations at the breakfast which was held in this building on Tuesday morning and they reflected some of those issues also raised by Senator Ketter. We will continue to receive those views from the stakeholders as the scoping study progresses.</span>

What we are pursuing at the moment is a scoping study in terms of the future ownership of Australian Hearing, but we have not made a decision. I think it is irresponsible and unfair of those opposite to engage in their usual scaremongering when it is clearly the case that the government has not made a decision.</span>

National Skills Week is one of the most important weeks on this nation's calendar. This government is committed not only to a stronger economy but to a strong skills base that will enable Australia's young people to make the most of the opportunities that are available. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Industry has been extraordinarily busy in this space since the election. The department's VET Reform Taskforce has been consulting widely across the nation. I understand from the minister that the task force has had some 5,000 engagements. Those consultations are continuing and this government is determined to ensure that industry and others have the opportunity to have input into our future plans. We have been listening to industry and to training companies to ensure that these VET reforms are strategic, meaningful and lasting and will strengthen a critical sector of our economy. A highly skilled and capable workforce, as I am sure all in this chamber appreciate, underpins this nation's competitiveness and productivity. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to confirm again that this government is getting on with providing real support for apprentices. Our trade support loans legislation, which passed this place earlier this year, is about providing those of Australia's young people who wish to take the apprenticeship and training path—which they are entitled to do and which we encourage them to do—with $20,000 loans over four years. This relieves their financial burdens and also increases completion rates for apprentices.<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government, through the minister, has released a discussion paper for the $476 million Industry Skills Fund which will deliver over 200,000 targeted training places and training support services. This will assist small- and medium-sized businesses not only in the senator's home state of Western Australia but right throughout the nation. Since July, when these loans started, the take-up has been fantastic. In the first three weeks of August alone some 1,700 apprentices applied, many of whom are currently in training and many of whom have already received their first cheque. I think that should excite all senators. It is a great opportunity for those young people to make a long-lasting contribution to this nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The trade support loans are available to all Australian apprentices who are studying in a skills need area—specifically, an apprenticeship or traineeship with a certificate III or certificate IV qualification that leads to an occupation on the National Skills Need List, such as electrician, cook, plumber, hairdresser or joiner, or an apprenticeship or traineeship with a certificate II, certificate III or certificate IV qualification in agriculture or horticulture. </span>

Apprentices—and I think it is important to note this—will not start repaying their loan until they are earning a sustainable income of more than $50,000. Those who complete their training will get a 20 per cent discount on their loan, meaning they will repay less than they borrowed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins and Singh today relating to data retention and to section 18C of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brandis has made it very clear today that it is orthodox cabinet process for the leader to override the Attorney-General on his signature policy and to leave it until right at the last minute to tell the Attorney-General he is doing so. We all know that Senator Brandis has staked his career and his 'freedom agenda' on this particular signature policy, so what did he find to say when he was confronted with this reality—that the Prime Minister had rolled him on his signature policy? On Sky News on 6 August, Senator Brandis said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Well you know what this business is like … you win a few, you lose a few.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has Senator Brandis won? In his almost 12 months in the role of Attorney-General for this country he has won nothing. On the other hand, what has he lost? He has lost his credibility, he has lost all respect and he has been completely rolled by the Prime Minister on a signature policy that he had staked his career as Attorney-General on. He lost all that on one of his first pieces of legislative reform, a favour that he wanted to do for his friends in the IPA and for his friend—or the Prime Minister's friend—Andrew Bolt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the chief duties of a politician and of a legislator is to explain one's program and to persuade the public about its value in that constant battle of ideas. So how has the Attorney-General fared in this endeavour? What is his record of victory in that marketplace of ideas? Has he demonstrated the levels of competence in public life that are the basic requirement of the political trade and, indeed, that of an Attorney-General. Let us turn to that first signature policy, a key reform, which, in many ways, Senator Brandis very much staked his career on: the repeal and removal of protections against racist hate speech in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many people, this may not seem a worthy goal, but for Senator Brandis and his ideological gang, including the IPA, it certainly was. How did he proceed in the implementation of it? There is no doubt that, on that first question of explaining what he was doing to the Australian people, he had had some measure of success in the end. For Senator Brandis, the primary right that needed to be defended was, as he so clearly explained, the right for bigots to be bigots. After this statement, it became very clear what he intended. He had explained himself and his program; but, after their understanding of that explanation, the community issued a resounding rejection of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had failed in that other important test—that of persuasion. He had completely failed it. There were some 5,000 submissions on his flawed consultation process and the majority of them were a complete and utter rejection of what Senator Brandis highlighted as his signature policy. Why? Because we know what Senator Brandis was trying to do in his freedom agenda: he was trying to allow the rights of bigots to have more precedence in this country than the rights of victims of racist hate speech. So he fell very fast and hard on that first hurdle—the hurdle of persuasion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then in the most recent foray of his political endeavours, he has not even been able to reach the second hurdle. Anybody who watched Senator Brandis attempt to explain metadata on Sky News might be tempted to conclude that he has never actually used the World Wide Web or been familiar with the difference between an IP address and a website name. We all know that Senator Brandis likes spending taxpayers' money on books and expensive bookshelves, so my advice to Senator Brandis is that maybe he should pick himself up a copy of the 'dummies guide to the internet', and then perhaps he will not need the communications minister to clean up his mess. Maybe he should recognise that his embarrassing performance in that regard and, indeed, his embarrassing performance in relation to racial hate speech were a rejection of his role as an Attorney-General. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I rise to take note of the motion moved by Senator Singh. What the opposition have demonstrated with the presentation that Senator Singh just made is that they are prepared to just make it up as they go along. Senator Singh characterises the policy around 18C as Senator Brandis's signature policy. It was a policy that the government took to the last election. I think quite rightly and quite genuinely Senator Brandis put out a consultation paper to the community to allow community consultation and comment, yet now Senator Singh wants to complain that the government actually took notice of that consultation process. Senator Singh put statistics on the table about the reaction to it. I think a good government will take note of community consultation. It will take note of current circumstances that exist when proposing pieces of legislation. </span>

                  </a>  I thought it was about counter-terrorism laws.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator COLBECK:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, it is also about counter-terrorism laws. The government quite rightly made the decision that it did not want the issue of 18C to be a distraction to what is a very serious issue for this country with respect to dealing with the issue of counter-terrorism. I think it was a wise decision. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a good government does is take note of the consultation process it might have publicly and also take note of the views that are held within its party room. It does not, as the previous government did over six years, run a chaotic top-down process where decisions were not taken as part of cabinet. We heard Senator Brandis say during question time that the decision with respect of 18C was made in cabinet and announced subsequent to the cabinet meeting, as it should have been. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know that members of the government consulted broadly amongst the party room. There are members of this government who have expressed publicly their concerns about the government's proposals on 18C. They were in close contact with their communities about the proposals of 18C. They utilised the very wise process that Senator Brandis put in place around the exposure draft to consult with their communities. They brought that feedback back to the government through the party room, through their direct consultations with Senator Brandis and, I am sure, through their direct consultation with the Prime Minister, his office and other members of the executive. That is a good, considered government process. When the collective wisdom of the cabinet came together to discuss the issue, they took all of those matters into account. I think that is quite a wise process. Why would you not do that? You have a strong view in the community. You have a range of views within the party room. The process is put out for public consultation. An exposure draft of the legislation is put into the community to talk about. At the end of the day, after gathering all of that information together,  you make a decision based on the consideration of all of the circumstances that were in play at the time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite those who might want to downplay the threat of terrorism in this country, it is a significant threat. Anyone who has a good knowledge and understanding of these issues is expressing that view right now. To take away a distraction to that, alongside the process of good and sound community consultation, only make sense, and the characterisation that the opposition has portrayed around this decision today quite clearly does not stack up. They imply that it is a signature policy of Senator Brandis, but it was a policy that the government took to the last election and we have made a wise decision on that policy in cabinet. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  After such a long time struggling to become a cabinet minister, of course Senator Brandis must have been delighted to have been appointed as our Attorney-General. As all of us in this place know, Senator Brandis has an absolutely towering view of his own capacity and his own importance. He certainly convinced a lot of us of his potential, and he had only really been stymied by former Prime Minister Howard, who he had allegedly described as a lying rodent but defended himself by saying he only called him a rodent. When Senator Brandis was elevated to cabinet, many of us, myself included, thought he would make a pretty reasonable job of it. I said something very positive in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> about him last July:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no doubt George is a capable and effective politician. He's one of the Liberals' best, but he does take himself very seriously at times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got the last bit right but I got the rest of it quite wrong —Senator Brandis has been a complete disappointment. He has made an absolutely, utterly, ham-fisted botch of being Attorney-General of Australia. For someone who is so full of himself, it must have been a truly terrible revelation for him to have come face to face with the fact that he is just not up to the job. He does not understand the detail of the legislation that he is responsible for. Take mandatory metadata retention. The Attorney-General does not even know what it is that his legislation would make ISPs retain. That is hardly a surprise, seeing as he does not seem to understand at all how the internet works. He said that what people were viewing on the internet would not be included but that the web address they communicated to would be. Of course it would have been better for the Attorney to consult with the communications minister, who knows something about the internet, but the communications minister had to learn about what the government was up to in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span>. This was excruciatingly humiliating for Senator Brandis, and that interview he did on Sky News was so bad, he was so out of his depth, that even members of the Labor Party told me they felt sorry for him. I did not share their view, but it was certainly extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The U-turn on 18C reforms will always be an unforgettable legacy of this Attorney-General. An exposure draft on that was released without even checking with the cabinet—a disaster of a draft, made worse by Senator Brandis's public admission in this chamber that it was a licence for bigotry: 'People have the right to be bigots,' he said. Then, on 4 August, he was telling the public via Peter van Onselen that he still wanted to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, but on 5 August he was standing next to Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, who dumped him and his proposal. But he claims today that that is orthodox cabinet process. I say very generously to Senator Brandis, 'George, you've really got to lift your game. You are embarrassing yourself, you are embarrassing your party.' It is a fact of life that Senator Brandis is nowhere near as good as he thinks he is, as Senator Williams knows. George Brandis should stop being a complete clown. That is what the public think about him. He should step up or step down. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time">):</span>  Metadata and security is a very serious issue. As Senator Faulkner would be well aware, the government has put more than $600 million towards our security. Senator Lines is in the chamber and obviously, like a naughty student, she has been summoned to the principal's office for six of the best because of her comments yesterday. This is not a political game to be played—it is a very serious issue. There are some 100 Australians here in our nation assisting people overseas in areas like northern Iraq and Syria, where we see these inhumane and despicable actions being carried out and put on the internet for people to view. It is a serious issue and it is not a time to play politics. As you know, Mr Deputy President, the Australian Labor Party aligns with the government when it comes to the security of Australians. It is an issue first and foremost for anyone who sits in either of the chambers here in Canberra. It is quite amazing what those in ISIL are doing. We do not want that to grow. We do not want to have Australians—especially young Australians—being indoctrinated into participating in these disgraceful activities around the world. We need to keep our country safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about metadata and the retention of knowledge that helps our agencies like ASIO and the Federal Police, it takes me back to several years ago when five people were charged. Three were found guilty and locked up. Their goal was to shoot up those training in Holsworthy Army base. Thankfully, through the great work of our agents, that did not occur, and those culprits were charged, found guilty and locked up. What a terrible tragedy that would have been if something like that did occur. That is why it is important that the metadata be secured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Metadata is information produced by the communication systems. When you are using, for example, mobile phones, the data notes whom you call, time of your discussion and how regularly you call that person. These details are great information for our agents to monitor and keep our nation safe. That is what this is all about. Metadata should be retained for the proposed two years. As David Irvine, the Director-General of ASIO, has said, 'Unless metadata storage practices are changed, law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts will be severely hampered.' We do not want to see those law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts severely hampered in this place. I do not think any one of us wants to see that. Our security agents have also been very clear that they do not want industry to be required to keep records about Australians' web-browsing. As part of our work to keep Australians safe from terrorism, consultations are starting with telecommunications providers about continuing to retain metadata. Our law enforcement agencies must have all the tools at their disposal to track down criminals and keep the community safe. That is what is most important here. It is not a political joke. It is not a political football to be kicked about. It is about keeping Australians safe and returning the world to peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am alarmed when people like Senator Lines think we are using this as a deterrent from looking at budget questions. If that were the case, why isn't this a motion to take note of answers to budget questions? Why aren't there more questions about the budget? That is ironic in itself. Here we are, answering questions on metadata and security. It is a very serious issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As far as 18C goes, the government will not proceed with the proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 at a time when the threat to Australia from extremists is real and growing. That is most important We need to be a united country, to work together, to forward information—whatever people hear or see—to our agents and our police because we need to keep Australians safe. We need to do our utmost, working with our colleagues and our allies around the world, to see that we do our best to keep our nation safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231199" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  Wasn't August a big month for Senator Brandis? First up, we had Senator Brandis finally falling on his sword with respect to his proposed 'rights to be bigots' reform to the Racial Discrimination Act. Then, minutes later, in the same press conference, we had the Prime Minister and Senator Brandis bumbling over the government's new mandatory data retention laws and its lack of a definition for metadata. The press conference was followed by one of the most excruciating interviews since Mike Willesee sliced John Hewson into hundreds of pieces of birthday cake over 20 years ago. That interview was on Dr Hewson's proposed 15 per cent GST. From the answers of the Leader of the Government in the Senate today, it appears the Liberal-National coalition is still as lost on the topic of the GST as it was under Dr Hewson. But I digress and return to the Brandis bungles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the thousands of Australians and hundreds of organisations who rose up to speak against these changes. The voices of the people have been heard loud and clear across the country and the world. This backdown, this broken election promise, is a win for tolerance in this country. It is a win for our multicultural Australian society. Thankfully, the proposed ill-conceived changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act now rest where they always truly belonged—on the scrap heap. The Attorney-General spent months here in the Senate stating that the government were about protecting the right of bigots. No-one has the right to be a bigot, Senator Brandis—not Andrew Bolt, not the racist who dropped anti-Semitic leaflets in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. It is still a concern that the Abbott government appears to have left this reform in the top drawer. It is not good enough. Even the proposal of these reforms and the bungled explanations from the Attorney-General signalled a green light to racism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to comment on the ongoing Brandis bungle on data retention. What is metadata? Despite the policy announcement and the huge fanfare, at present the government does not have a clear definition of metadata or 'megadata', as one confused journalist said in a recent interview—a slip of the tongue that is symptomatic of this government's absolute failure to explain anything that it is doing. For if the press cannot even get a simple phrase correct and if the government does not have a clear definition of that phrase, how does Senator Brandis expect the Australian people to understand what it all means? The really concerning thing in the data retention debate is that we are dealing with vitally important national security issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a responsible party of government, the Labor Party has a natural inclination to support the government of the day in its ventures to keep Australia safe. However, if the government are incapable of structuring a coherent argument, how can you expect the Labor Party to work through these complex national security matters with them? It would not be responsible of the opposition, the Labor Party, to give the government a blank cheque on their reforms. These reforms are complex, but the Abbott government, through its Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, has been particularly confused in its explanations of these policies. It is important that the government understands the details of its policies. There are very serious matters at stake. It is also vital that the proposed reform to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is not kept in the top drawer by the Liberal and National parties for another day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the new senator from Queensland, Senator McGrath, who has said that he will cross the floor and vote for Senator Day's private senator's bill on these reforms. Senator McGrath is of course from Queensland, the home of outspoken Senator Macdonald and the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I hope Senator Brandis holds firm and does not introduce this reform, and I hope Senator Brandis holds firm and breaks his election commitment, because I believe this reform offends the Australian spirit. I believe this reform offends Australia's notion of a fair go for all. It the election commitment to reform the Racial Discrimination Act is so dispensable, if the definition of metadata is too hard to explain, then no-one should believe Senator Abetz when he says that the government has no intention of changing GST distribution.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Payne) to a question without notice asked by Senator Rhiannon today relating to proposed higher education funding changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Less than six hours after the Minister for Education, Minister Pyne, introduced the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill, you would have to say that his arguments as to why that is needed are really on the rocks. It is worth looking into some of the details of what he said, because in question time just now, in this chamber, Minister Payne failed to confirm that a single new student who otherwise would not have enrolled in a bachelor degree at a private higher-education provider will take up studies as a result of the government's proposed funding changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is out there trying to whip up excitement for his bill. Maybe we would say that that is his job, but we would hope that he would be accurate in what he puts out there for public consideration. One of his key statements is that 80,000 extra students will be enrolled in Commonwealth supported places by 2018. That sounds impressive, and that is what the minister wants us to think. But let us look behind his bald statements. It is true that students in the private sector and those studying sub-bachelor degrees in the university system will now receive Commonwealth support. However, the government is unable to confirm that new students will enrol in these courses as a result of the changes, and that is key to what we are considering here. In fact, the bill's explanatory memorandum confirms that the rate of growth in student enrolments in this area will be slower than in previous years. So, you have that acknowledgement in the explanatory memorandum, and we have a minister who cannot confirm that there will be new students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The end result of these changes will be a windfall of half a million dollars in subsidies for private higher education providers without any guarantee of increasing access. We are told many things about this legislation, but at the end of the day it is about saving the government money—and it is a lot of money: $5 billion ripped out of our public university system. And it is about giving public money—subsidies—to private providers. The government's proposed changes to higher education funding will see these public subsidies come into play. We have seen with TAFE, particularly in Victoria, how damaging this can be, not just to education but indeed to the very fabric of our society when you consider how education underpins so much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the misleading statements from the minister do not stop there. It is worth considering his claim about Commonwealth scholarships. Minister Pyne argues that the Commonwealth scholarship will provide more opportunity for students with low socioeconomic backgrounds and from regional areas. No public government money will go to Commonwealth scholarships. The minister has actually stolen the good name that Commonwealth scholarships had. Many of us long ago did benefit from such scholarships, and they were scholarships with government money. But he has taken that name, misused that name, because there is no public money. Universities will be forced to increase their fees by at least 20 per cent before a single dollar from the university can be diverted to the creation of Commonwealth scholarships. And it will be the group of eight universities that will be able to maximise the increase in student fees under deregulation that will have the largest pool of funds for Commonwealth scholarships. This is another area where the legislation, if passed, would become unfair and so damaging to the way higher education plays out in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These universities, the group of eight, have the lowest proportion of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Small and regional universities who teach the higher proportion of low-SES-background students will have the smallest amount of funding for Commonwealth scholarships. Mr Pyne has said that he did not expect fees to increase significantly under a deregulated system. But Mr Pyne cannot have it both ways. Either fees will increase significantly or Commonwealth scholarships do not exist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other areas where the minister is being misleading. He claims that when universities and colleges compete, students win. He is already undermining that assertion. And he says that there are no threats to cut research funding—grossly inaccurate there, because those cuts are already in place. The coalition has already cut— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This information will provide preliminary national, state and territory level results four weeks ahead of the time that the Summary Report was released in 2013. In addition, the majority of states and territories will deliver results back to schools and parents sooner. It is expected that in 2015 turnaround times will continue to be reduced.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A key element of the rationale for delivering NAPLAN testing online is that there will be a significant reduction in the time taken to provide feedback to schools, students and parents.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of all students, including those with disability, continue to be taken into account in the design of NAPLAN testing online. Student assessments should be designed to cover a broad range of abilities that enables the strengths and weaknesses of students to be measured. For NAPLAN testing, disability is defined as per the Commonwealth <span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">Disability Discrimination Act 1992</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the individual student level, NAPLAN provides a measure of literacy and numeracy skills relative to his or her peers. This measure can then be used to monitor student progress, enable longitudinal tracking of student achievement, and inform strategies for improving literacy and numeracy achievements. To achieve this, tests must yield comparable data, so that students' results can be compared and placed on a scale relative to each other. For a test to yield comparable data, tests must be standardised, and students must as far as possible undergo the same test experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the case of students with disability, this may entail adjustments to the standard way a test is delivered and undertaken. Adjustments are intended to enable access to the tests on an equivalent basis to students without disability, so that the adjusted test measures the student's literacy or numeracy performance, rather than measuring the impact of the student's disability or disabilities on their test experience (which an unadjusted test would show).</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The current NAPLAN testing regime achieves the above through the <span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">National Protocols for Test Administration 2014</span> (the Protocols) and in particular the <span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">Adjustments for Students with a Disability</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>section, consistent with the <span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">Disability Standards for Education 2005</span>, which set out the rights of students with disability and the obligations of school authorities in relation to education under the <span style="font-style:italic;color:gray;">Disability Discrimination Act 1992</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The tests identify whether all students have the literacy and numeracy skills that provide the critical foundation for their learning. While it is recognised that all students do not have the same cultural and language background, competency in Australian English is essential for all students to allow them to participate fully in Australian society. This is particularly important for students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island heritages who may not speak English as their first, second or third language, as well as migrant and refugee students.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the test development process, all proposed test items undergo quality assurance that takes cultural background into account. In preparing the assessments, test developers must ensure NAPLAN tests are not culturally biased against any student group, including students from a non-English speaking background. The development process involves ACARA working with specialist item writers under contract, and supported by expert review and recommendations from officials from all states and territories, including assessment and curriculum specialists. This process ensures that no questions in the NAPLAN tests require direct personal knowledge of a topic outside the curriculum for respective year levels.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">NAPLAN results are an important resource for teachers to be able to target their teaching practice to the needs of their students. The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers require teachers to be able to assess, provide feedback and report on student learning. For the Graduate standard, this includes an expectation that teachers can 'demonstrate the capacity to interpret student assessment data to evaluate student learning and modify teaching practice.'

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The national approach to the Accreditation of Initial Teacher Education Programs in Australia: Standards and Procedures require universities to demonstrate how they will be preparing their students to meet the Graduate teacher standard. The data produced by NAPLAN tests are rich and detailed and can be of great value in informing teaching practice and student learning. Analysis of the data down to the level of each test question (item), for each student, can help teachers identify the gaps in learning of particular students. It can also highlight areas where classroom strategies are succeeding or may need adjustment.</span>

For the latter group of students, the test design significantly enhances the testing context and student engagement.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three small words: liquid fuel security. They might be unfamiliar to many, but liquid fuel security underpins the Australian way of life. It is essential to drive our children to school. It is essential so we can shop for fruit and vegetables and it is necessary to guarantee travel to anywhere for any reason. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liquid fuel security underpins our industry. Liquid fuel security underpins our farming sector. Liquid fuel security underpins our manufacturers and our food processors. What is more, liquid fuel security is the linchpin of what makes Australia secure. Our army, our air force, our navy and our various other defence and national security organisations must have security of liquid fuel. Retired Air Vice-Marshal John Blackburn AO said recently: 'Without fuel we don't survive.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This discussion today is not about division. It is not about political point-scoring. It is about bringing this issue to the forefront of public debate. It is about unifying all in this place to, firstly, recognise the importance of liquid fuel security, and then to come up with a plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must have a plan. We have reached a crossroad. By the end of next year, 90 per cent of our transport fuel, whether refined or crude, will be imported. In the year 2000—just 14 years ago—that figure was closer to 60 per cent. By no later than 2030 that figure is anticipated to be 100 per cent. But these are projections, and things can change with a plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I was looking at the end-of-month stock holdings of various fuels as reported by the government. As of June this year we had 30 days worth of LPG in storage, 19 days of petrol, 17 days of aviation fuel and 12 days of diesel. This highlights two problems: the first is our dependence on imported fuel; and the second is our poor preparedness and capability to respond to any crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These two crucial issues call for a national liquid fuel security plan. It might seem as if I am overemphasising the importance this issue has for Australia, but this is not the case. The International Energy Agency says on this topic that it requires member nations to have 90 days of net import oil holdings. This includes oils with which you could not run a car, truck or plane on. It includes things like bitumen, lubricating oils, heating oils et cetera. Even including these oils—oils which do not all assure transport energy security—latest figures suggest Australia only has 52 days of reserves. That is below the 71 days recorded in previous reports. A high percentage of these fuels are imported from overseas. A high percentage are also still at sea, not even on our shore. I and many Australians believe a risk assessment must be conducted. To do this, we would need to assess the whole supply chain all the way back to the Middle East.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Singapore is an oil-refining hub, we cannot presume it is rock solid. As senators would be aware, events in the ASEAN sphere are quite dynamic. Small regional issues can suddenly have huge implications for our nation. When I talk about the risks associated with importing fuel from Singapore, I am not talking about 1960s-style gunboat diplomacy with its associated blockades. If the disruption was a targeted one, as opposed to a consequence of regional instability, many nations could simply put pressure on the owners of the shipping companies or even the nations who have provided the vessel with a flag. Nations receiving foreign aid, for instance, could be used as leverage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the matter of supply lines, Dr Vlado Vivoda of Griffith University warned:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our supplies are essentially subject to the security of supply lines that bring petroleum products from international markets, particularly from Singapore, which we are becoming increasingly reliant on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue which any plan would have to focus on is our preparedness and capability to respond to any crisis which disrupts our supply chain. By no means do I purport to have the answers, but I have plenty of questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the year 2000, Australia had seven refineries. Coming into 2016, Australia will have only four. By modern standards, these refineries are admittedly quite small but nonetheless are doing a great job. Caltex, Mobil, BP and Vitol—the new owner of the Shell refinery in Geelong—are the four owners. These refineries alone have served us well. However, in the event of a crisis, would their capabilities be sufficient? Will the storage of liquid fuel be sufficient? Based on the current figures—and depending on the nature of the crisis—absolutely not. Considering Australia has 52 days of net import oil holdings, one might consider that this is the norm by world standards. But the International Energy Agency information for May 2013 indicates that Korea has 240 days, the UK has 220 days, the US has 209 days and even New Zealand has 103 days, almost double what we currently have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a crucial issue. Next week I will call for an inquiry. This is an issue I want the government, the opposition, the crossbench and all stakeholders—all Australians—to recognise and address. I will use Air Vice Marshall John Blackburn AO's words to sum up my contribution to this debate on liquid fuel security. He said: 'We alone amongst all developed oil-importing countries rely completely on commercial market forces for our transport energy security. This is no less perilous than contracting out our Defence Forces or outsourcing our food supply.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I thank Senator Madigan for introducing this motion and for his contribution. He referenced the work of John Blackburn, who has been a very well-informed and powerful voice in this area. Senator Madigan may not be aware that he, in fact, was here in Parliament House just two days ago, briefing the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on these very issues. We talked through a whole range of aspects of Australia's fuel security, so I understand Senator Madigan's concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that in Australia at the moment we still have four refineries operating, as Senator Madigan said. The challenge for Australia is to look not just at the supply side, as important as that is. It is also to look at how we reduce the demand side. The important areas to understand are where we are using energy, where the alternative sources are and, importantly, how quickly we are using energy and how we can reduce supply demand. Even things such as inquiries into climate have identified that car emissions and car use of fuel as we make cars more efficient can cumulatively cause a substantial reduction in the demand for liquid fuels. So part of the whole the equation is not just looking at the supply side but understanding how we can work with car manufacturers on the standards we put on imported cars to make sure that the fuel consumption of cars not only benefits the environment but reduces the demand for liquid fuels such that we balance up that issue between supply and demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia currently exports both crude oil and refined products, and it imports both crude oil and refined products from a wide range of sources. One of the advantages Australia has is that it is an energy-producing nation. One of the things that Australia has been good at for many years is fuel source innovation. In looking at supply, we need to consider the roles of unconventional oils, natural gases, natural gas liquids and even biofuels as well as the role of traditional petrochemicals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the market, we have seen throughout the world's history that, even in times of calamity or conflict, there can be responses by governments to work through what would otherwise be considered failures of the market. Where commercial shipping has failed ships, we have seen ships taken up from trade—governments have, essentially, taken over or nationalised supply lines. There are areas where you can overcome issues with insurers through governments paying premiums and looking at ways to make sure that we do have continuity of supply. As Senator Madigan has indicated, Singapore is a hub; but we also have liquid fuels coming from places like Japan, as well as from the Middle East via Singapore. There are alternatives that the government can look at, but Senator Madigan's point about the need for a suitable risk analysis is well made and was brought out just this week in the briefings that I was discussing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the issues for refinery capacity within Australia is that the scale in Australia makes it very difficult for commercial viability for companies to invest in new refining capability here or to sustain capability in the face of product that they can bring in and make available to the consumer at a lower price. One of the problems with the simple reaction, which is that we should just mandate more production capacity here, is that it starts to distort the market. We already know the price pressure that consumers quite rightly highlight in relation to petrol prices and other liquid fuels. If we were to mandate or in some way regulate a capacity on the commercial market it would drive up prices for Australian consumers. So it is a balancing act to try to understand what the supply chain is, the parts where there are weaknesses and how we can work constructively with industry to make sure that we have both reliability and security of supply whilst making fuels available for Australian consumers, whether they be farmers or people in the cities who need that fuel for their daily life. That needs to be  done in a way that does not drive up prices but achieves the outcome that the government is looking for. We understand the factors that have led Senator Madigan to put forward this motion. Studies have been done and there is currently a process underway in which Mr Blackburn and others have been advocating for further risk studies. I cease my remarks there.</span>

It is a very important issue and one that shows that, yet again, we as a nation are not addressing an important issue with the gravity it deserves. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. It is an issue that I have been interested in for many years. When I was a member of the South Australian parliament I was very critical of the way that the Port Stanvac oil refinery was shut down by Mobil about 10 years ago. The state government did a very bad deal in handling the shutdown of that refinery. It was mothballed with no capacity for alternative competition to move into the refinery. We have had the situation in my home state of South Australia where fuel supplies are precarious. If something goes wrong with a ship, if it has been delayed at sea or breaks down, we could face a fuel crisis in South Australia with huge economic and social consequences.</span>

Refining in Australia has been in in free-fall for several years—it is down 30 per cent in two years and will continue to drop—as local refiners find themselves stranded with obsolete facilities and unable to compete with huge refineries overseas. Shell closed its Sydney refinery at Clyde in 2012. Caltex's closure later this year of its Kurnell refinery in Sydney means that Sydney will, for the first time since the 1920s—that is 90 years—be reliant entirely on imported fuel. BP has announced it will close its Bulwer refinery in Brisbane in mid-2015. South Australia lost its sole refinery in 2003—that is 11 years ago. These closures mean the loss of thousands of jobs—a huge challenge for each of those families. Senator Madigan and I have been campaigning relentlessly about manufacturing jobs in this country. These are manufacturing jobs we are losing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we are talking about fuel security in addition to job security. Australia will be left with four remaining refineries: BP's Kwinana unit in WA; Shell's Geelong refinery, which was this year sold to Vitol of Switzerland; Caltex's Lytton refinery in Brisbane, which recently announced more than 100 job losses as it seeks to cut costs and stay open; and ExxonMobil's Altona refinery in Melbourne. An NRMA report in February found that Australia will source 90 per cent of its liquid fuel needs from overseas by 2015 and predicted that by 2030 that will become a complete dependence on offshore sources of fuel. The contraction in Australia's liquid fuel supplies is not a surprise. It has been long expected and the dynamics driving it are well understood. Yet no Australian government has adequately assessed or planned for the obvious risks to our economy and society of a disruption to overseas fuel supplies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I endorse strongly endorse the comments of Senator Madigan in relation to the national security implications of this. If there is a conflict—if sea lanes are disrupted in an increasingly uncertain world—where does that leave us as a nation? It will bring us to a standstill. We are drifting towards a very insecure future, bobbing on a sea of risks and uncertainties in the global fuel market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And yet it seems to be business as usual. Our national dependence on liquid fuels outsourced to pitiless fuel multinationals. Surely, it is time for the federal government to assert the national interest and plan for a minimum fuel-refining capacity in this country and for minimum fuel supplies. The United States and other countries do it; we have been absolute mugs when it comes to this. I am not sure if Senator Madigan can assist me, but I think the level of fuel supplies we have at the moment is for weeks and not the months that we actually need. The NRMA report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's liquid fuel s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ecurity</span>, released in February this year, found we would be left high and dry if there were a significant disruption to overseas shipping lanes, refining capacity or oil production. It warned that Australia would have about three weeks of fuel on hand, if supplies were halted for whatever reason, from 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a national scandal. If demand were high—as in a run on fuel supplies in an emergency—stocks would scarcely last a week, the NRMA warned. Senator Madigan gently reminded me that we nearly ran out of diesel last year, and in his home town of Ballarat there was a diesel fuel shortage. I did not go to the joint standing committee briefing, but I previously received a one-on-one briefing with Air Vice-Marshal John Blackburn, the author of that report. I commend him for the tremendous work he is doing. This is what he had to say: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If this happens, then Australians will suffer food shortages, will not have adequate access to medical services or pharmaceutical supplies, will not be able to get to work and, if the problem lasts for more than a  few weeks, many will no longer have work to go to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion that has been introduced by Senator Madigan deserves our strong support; it deserves not just our words but action from the Australian government. We cannot put our heads in the sand on this issue; we must act decisively on our fuel supply. The NRMA suggests we need at least 30 per cent of our fuel refined here in Australia if we are to avoid the worst effects of unforseen crises in shipping, the oil sector or global refining capacity. Why isn't the government looking at this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2005 I have been warning of Australia's limited refining capacity, when a secret South Australian government report warned that my home state was regularly running dangerously low on fuel. These are the issues that need to be dealt with. I hope Senator Madigan will raise it again. As I do on many other issues, I will work collaboratively with Senator Madigan on this issue because it deserves to be at the forefront of the government's attention; it has not been to date. If we do not tackle the issue sooner rather than later, it will lead to a national emergency and it will have calamitous consequences for our economy and our society. This issue will not go away—we must tackle it as a nation. I again commend Senator Madigan for raising this issue.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8IV" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  This relates to legislation I introduced back in 2012, which is still on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> and which needs to be debated and dealt with. The aim of the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 is to detect and reduce money laundering in Australia's more than 5,400 poker-machine venues. Back in 2012, when I first introduced this bill to amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, reports were emerging of a Melbourne hotel that had failed to act on suspicions of money laundering through its poker machines. Records showed an individual and his family were claiming winnings of up to $40,000 per week. Anyone who knows anything about poker machines will tell you these odds are nigh-on impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report—by Adam Shand and Chip Le Grand of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>—was just the tip of the iceberg of the use by criminals of poker machines for money laundering. Unfortunately, the parliament did not support the bill on that occasion; and, unfortunately and predictably, the problem has not gone away. If anything it has gotten worse. The government's money laundering intelligence agency, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre AUSTRAC, recently detected a 'significant increase' in the number of suspicious activity reports in relation to the use of gaming machines, according to a report this month in News Ltd publications by Frank Chung. AUSTRAC chief executive John Schmidt said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">AUSTRAC has undertaken focused regulatory activities in the pubs and clubs sector around suspicious-matter reporting over the past few years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By consulting with our partner agencies in law enforcement, AUSTRAC has been able to identify patterns of behaviour that potentially constitute money laundering in hotels and clubs operating electronic gaming machines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regulatory engagement with the licenced venues, including sharing examples of risky patron behaviour, has helped to improve awareness and identification of potential money laundering activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AUSTRAC went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This work, coupled with the provision of specific guidance to industry, has created greater awareness of the money laundering risks in the industry and has resulted in a significant increase in suspicious-matter reporting being received by AUSTRAC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the work of AUSTRAC and its partners in law enforcement, including the AFP, as well as cooperating licensed venues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police told News Ltd that the AFP was targeting money laundering, including in gaming machine venues. That person said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The methods by which money may be laundered are varied and can range in sophistication. Organised criminal syndicates use a variety of methods and avenues, including matters involving the gaming sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next comment by the AFP is crucial to understanding why it is essential that parliament look again at this bill that I have introduced again. The AFP spokesperson said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both state and federal police can lay charges under money laundering legislation. It is also important to note that the regulation of poker machines is a matter for states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AFP enforces money-laundering offences but it can only charge an organised crime figure or group with money-laundering offences if the crime has been detected in the first place. This bill, if passed, will dramatically improve the ability of AUSTRAC and the AFP to detect money laundering through poker machines. Improved detection will lead to more arrests and charges and, in the long run, less money laundering in Australia's suburban poker machine lounges and through our casinos.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AFP spokesperson also put their finger on the single biggest obstacle to the reform of the gaming machine sector in the country; that is, state governments. State governments are hopelessly compromised via the more than $4 billion in taxes that they raise each year from poker machine operators. But I do not suggest for one minute that they want to see any of those taxes coming from money-laundering activities nor do I suggest that the poker machine sector or the industry itself would want to see any money coming from money-laundering activities, which is why I am gobsmacked that they do not support this very sensible and measured piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the current laws, gambling venue owners are supposed to report suspicious transactions, but there is no legal obligation. State governments cannot be trusted to curb the excesses of this industry and have failed to curb the extent of money laundering in their own backyards, although it is preferable for it to be undertaken through federal law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry sources, reported in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> several years ago, have estimated that approximately $2 billion a year is laundered through hotel, club and casino poker machines and gambling chips each year nationally. The ability to load up poker machines with large amounts of cash, as well as the often lax regulations surrounding payouts, mean that launderers can and do get away with it. Criminals are attracted to poker machine venues because they are so commonplace. There are about 5,400 venues in Australia and many are darkly lit, anonymous places with very little face-to-face contact with staff or other customers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is even more necessary now than when I first introduced it in 2012. In that time, the number of poker machines has continued to expand, expanding the opportunities for criminals to use them for money laundering. One of the most recent assessment of poker machine numbers in Australia, based on state and territory figures from last July, indicates that Australia has about 200,000 poker machines across 5,400 venues. Combined, they reaped almost $13 billion in losses from Australians each year—forty per cent of that, parenthetically, is from problem gamblers, according to the Productivity Commission. I will not now go into the significant damage that that causes individuals, because the focus of this bill is in relation to money laundering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes to ensure that the extent of money laundering is restricted and that it is made much more difficult. Money laundering through poker machines can be achieved by one of two ways. Separately or in combination, criminals can load up thousands of dollars into a machine, up to but not above the trigger for payouts to be made by cheque. It is $10,000 in NSW, as I understand it. They then play a few games, usually losing a few dollars, and then cash out their credits with the venue—laundering the money in the process. Depending on the regulations in each state, careful so-called playing can ensure that the criminal walks out with thousands of dollars in clean—that is, laundered—money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A second option for criminals, usually used in combination with the first, is to wait around venues until a gambler wins a prize. Depending on the regulations, winnings over a certain amount are issued by cheque to make sure that gamblers have a cooling-off period while the cheque is processed so that they do not gamble away their winnings. Instead, criminals approach gamblers and offer to buy the cheques off them for cash, often at a discount, which the gambler can then use to continue playing. The launderers then cash the cheques, which have been signed over by the original claimant and do not carry the name of the criminal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill aims to address these practices through requiring that payouts over $1,000 are made by cheque and are threshold transactions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. Such transactions require a report made to AUSTRAC in the approved form under the act, allowing AUSTRAC to monitor and record such activity for the purposes of reducing money laundering and other prohibited actions. This reporting usually includes relevant personal details of the so-called winner and details of the transaction itself. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also requires that any cheques or credits for winnings that are transferred into another name are also threshold transactions under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and also requires the details of the new recipient of the cheque or credit to be reported to AUSTRAC. Failure by venues to comply with the act can result in a significant penalty.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that because of the miserly nature of poker machine payouts, these changes will not be an undue burden on venues. There are not going to be that many transactions in a typical day that will be affected by this, but it will make a difference with the criminals who are laundering up to $2 billion a year of drug money that is made through organised crime and various illegal activities through poker machine venues. Poker machines rarely pay out in large amounts and instead are generally programmed to provide smaller, interspersed wins. Creating these two new definitions of threshold transactions will allow AUSTRAC access to information relating to larger wins and will lead to a fine-grain view of patterns and habits vital to uncovering criminal activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not suggesting that this will put an end to that criminal activity, but it is going to make it a lot harder and a lot more cumbersome for the criminals. It will make their lives just that little bit more miserable. It will mean that they will have to work a lot harder to try to launder money. It will mean that there is a higher risk of detection because of what they will have to do to get around what is being proposed. Under these proposals, each cheque drawn triggers a report to AUSTRAC and the AFP. Armed with the information on suspected money launderers, AUSTRAC and the AFP can then apply anti-money-laundering offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, if passed, will also act as a deterrent to criminals who will no longer be able to use the machines to launder large amounts of cash. The bill also amends the act so that the controller of a poker machine venue will be considered to be providing a designated service under the act. This will mean that the controllers of poker machine venues will be required to abide by the laws surrounding threshold transactions. AUSTRAC already has regulations in place relating to some forms of gambling, including sports betting and casinos. These additional safeguards are a way to plug a loophole in the law, as well as protecting problem gamblers and venue owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Poker machines cause great harm in our communities. The poker machine sector is clearly wary of regulations. They fought and succeeded in stymying moves in the last parliament to limit the damage done to problem gamblers via $1 bets and mandatory precommitment, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. Such measures, if adopted, would have made a real difference to many people's lives. Now, unfortunately, it appears that the poker machine lobby, the poker machine barons, will resist these simple measures to curb money laundering via poker machines. Clubs Australia Executive Director, Anthony Ball—Anthony, if you are listening, cheerio to you—has called this bill a 'waste of the time and resources of our federal parliament'. Mr Ball went on to say: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill has been rejected by the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee for Gambling Reform, and its introduction would only heap further regulatory burdens on clubs, which already have significant anti-money laundering compliance measures in place despite their low risk profile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Ball reckons that anyone attempting to launder money through poker machines would have to be the world's dumbest criminal due to the presence of CCTV cameras and existing identification requirements, saying, 'The only criminal who would try to do this is one who was desperate to get caught.' What nonsense. Mr Ball clearly, incredibly, has no understanding of what is going on in the venues he is meant to represent. He should pick up the phone and call AUSTRAC or the AFP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By contrast, Adam Masters—one who does not have a vested interest in this issue—who is a researcher with the Transnational Research Institute on Corruption at the Australian National University, has said that lowering the threshold for reporting to AUSTRAC to $1,000 would 'definitely have an effect' on the profitability of money-laundering operations. Mr Masters, a former 25-year veteran with the AFP and a former team leader for Interpol in Australia, predicted the bill would impose 'minimal administrative burdens on venues'. The poker machine sector already fleeces close to $13 billion from Australians each year. It must not be permitted to impede what I believe is sensible reform, what Mr Masters from the Australian National University says would impose a minimal administrative burden on venues but would make a difference in terms of money-laundering operations, make it harder for the criminals to launder their money. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is an essential step towards bringing the scourge of money laundering in poker machine venues into sharp focus and allowing police and AUSTRAC to enforce the law. I urge my Senate colleagues to support it when it next comes before the Senate for a vote.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  I rise to speak on Senator Xenophon's Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012. The government does not support this bill. This bill seeks to introduce amendments to existing legislation that will increase the regulatory demand on an already heavy regulated sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Electronic gaming machine venues, such as casinos, hotels and clubs, must already comply with strict obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. Depending on a venue's size, requirements under the existing act already include: having a program to identify, mitigate and manage money-laundering and terrorism-financing risk; identifying customers for transactions involving $10,000 or more; and reporting cash transactions of $10,000 or more. All gaming venues are already required to report suspicious matters to AUSTRAC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill is to amend the current act to lower the reporting threshold for gaming machine payments to $1,000. It also seeks to include the cashing of transferred cheques for amounts in excess of $1,000 in the definition of 'threshold transaction'. Under this bill these transactions would then have to be reported to AUSTRAC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believes that the current regulatory framework, in place since 2006, provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering and that lowering the threshold to the level suggested would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues. During the passage of the original legislation, the appropriate threshold for reporting was extensively analysed. The government believes that this is an issue of balance and that the balance is currently struck in the right place. The outcome of that original analysis was to set the threshold at its current level of $10,000. There is simply no evidence that this needs to be amended, as currently proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we will not be supporting this bill, the government does take money laundering very seriously, and that is why Minister Keenan recently announced changes to the customer due diligence obligations of regulated entities. These changes are designed to strengthen Australia's anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. The announced changes apply to electronic-gaming venues, and will increase transparency and customer identification processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ongoing work of gaming venues in customer due diligence, reporting threshold transactions and suspicious matters is of central importance. The government knows this and understands this and is acting on it. We believe AUSTRAC already works closely and collaboratively with industry and holds regular meetings with both state gaming regulators and industry associations to ensure that matters of concern are discussed and actioned where necessary, and also that all obligations under the act are understood. AUSTRAC has run a number of awareness campaigns over the last few years to increase awareness of the risk of money laundering through the use of electronic-gaming machines. As a result of these campaigns there has been a significant increase in the number of suspicious matter reports. In 2013-14, there were 381 suspicious matter reports, with a total value of $10.1 million. Compare this to 2012-13, when there were only 135, with a total value of $3.4 million. This indicates that education and awareness campaigns are working and are already having a significant effect in identifying money laundering through electronic gaming machines. These crucial measures assist law enforcement agencies to detect and investigate possible money laundering and other criminal activity connected to gaming venues in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also touch on the excellent work of AUSTRAC in this area. I was very heartened to hear Senator Xenophon acknowledge the wonderful job that the organisation is doing. AUSTRAC, as the primary body responsible for tracking money laundering within Australia, plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and security of all Australians. For many years I had very close involvement and association with AUSTRAC. I have seen first-hand the wonderful job that that organisation does on behalf of all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AUSTRAC's role is to protect the integrity of Australia's financial system and to contribute to the administration of justice through countering money laundering and terrorism. They do excellent work in conjunction with Australia's other law enforcement agencies to counter the financing of terror and organised crime. AUSTRAC continues to work collaboratively with businesses and law enforcement to assess money laundering threats in Australia. These joint efforts improve our ability to prevent, deter and prosecute money laundering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, through the Attorney-General's Department, is also currently undertaking a statutory review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. This very important review is estimated to be complete early in the new year. It will follow an on-site visit and mutual evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force. The Financial Action Task Force is the world standard-setting organisation for anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing. Australia, pleasingly, is currently the president of the Financial Action Task Force. This already reflects our position as the world leader in anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrary to Senator Xenophon's assertions of undue influence on the government in relation to this matter, the government does believe that the current regulatory framework provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering and that lowering the threshold to $1,000 would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues, especially those which are small business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government believes that the current regulatory framework provides adequate controls and mitigations for the risks of money laundering. Lowering the threshold to $1,000 would pose an unnecessary burden on gaming venues, especially those which are small businesses. This government is absolutely committed to reducing red tape in Australia by $1 billion each year and not increasing it. This commitment was realised in the first parliamentary repeal day in March this year and through other measures such as the National Gambling Regulator. The National Gaming Regulator and its associated measures duplicated the roles of state and territory regulators and foisted a huge, unnecessary and expensive red-tape burden on hospitality venues. While the government will not be supporting this bill, the government does take money laundering very seriously. That is why Minister Keenan has announced changes, as I have previously stated, to the customer due diligence obligations. We believe that these changes will apply to electronic gaming venues and will increase transparency and customer identification processes.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOORE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Senator Xenophon, we will continue to have these discussions in this chamber, as you well know. You will be bringing back your range of issues around gambling in Australia, as you need to do and as I know you will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us is the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 [2013]. I am disappointed that we did not have the chance to consider this bill in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and that I could not refer to the evidence that we had received in committees that we have served on in the past on a range of gambling bills. I did go back and checked out the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, to which this bill and three others went. They brought down their report in June 2013. Quite disappointingly, considering the amount of discussion that Senator Xenophon has brought to us today and in statements over the last year and a half to two years on this issue, when this bill was brought to the joint select committee there were only two submissions. It was probably one of the bills that attracted the least interest in the wider community. Perhaps they were scared away by the legal nature of it. Perhaps they did not want to get involved in the discussions of AUSTRAC and the various processes there. It is really difficult to get a sense of where the rights of the argument are when you only have two submissions, as anyone would know. These submissions came from Clubs Australia and the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce. Unfortunately, whenever we get into these discussions, these two groups—who both have knowledge, who both have a passion and who both make public statements expressing concerns about problem gambling—consistently do not agree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this bill, there was again a great divide in the evidence they presented. The church antigambling group pointed out their worries about the process and about their inability to communicate effectively with people in positions of authority. They expressed their concerns about the sorts of issues Senator Xenophon was raising—the problems of money laundering and the extra pressure that puts on people. They had already identified the problem of compulsive gamblers and the awful consequences for them and their families—and no-one knows more about those issues than the Australian Churches Gambling Taskforce. Those were the issues they raised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Understandably, the submission government received from Clubs Australia talked about the existing processes—just outlined here again by Senator Reynolds—the existing provisions under the act and the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill. They talked about the kinds of regulations and restrictions that already existed. Then, as we consistently hear in this debate, they emphasised what the impost on them, their businesses and their staff would be of any kind of restriction or any kind of regulation. Once again, then, as has consistently been the case in this debate, we have two groups who do not agree—two groups who, I think, far too often talk at each other rather than to each other and too often speak with third parties instead of with each other.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party is not willing to support the bill as it is written—and Senator Xenophon knows that. We are concerned that there continues to be conflicting evidence. I take your point absolutely, Senator Xenophon, about the academic research you brought to us today—which I have not read and which was not with your bill—from the well-regarded researcher you named in your contribution. I put a great deal of value on that sort of work and would like to see it continue, especially since one of the main things that has came out of our debates over the last two years is the absolute need for more independent research—that is something that everyone agrees on, I think. When we get such research, we need to discuss it from all perspectives. We need to see how the data supports the different arguments about what the impacts would be, for example, of a reduction in the amount of money that could be gambled—that thousand-dollar limit. In that context, and referring also to the evidence from AUSTRAC and the work that has already been done, we could objectively assess the claims that we hear: that there are strict regulations in place, that clubs are already regulated, that they have responsibilities which they regularly review, and that they try to ensure that their processes for discharging those responsibilities are clearly set out and transparent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the argument that is going on. Clubs Australia—and, to an extent AUSTRAC—are saying that the way they are implementing the current legislation is effective. I do not believe that any piece of legislation should ever be sacrosanct. I think it is very important that, as questions are raised and as the process attracts interest, there should be an opportunity to go back and review what is going on. I think Senator Xenophon's bill highlights exactly that kind of discussion point. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government position has been put by Minister Andrews, that he was moving away from the work that had been done by the previous government—options for various trials and the concept of having a central regulatory point. Senator Reynolds outlined that in her contribution. The government's position was that they wanted to start anew, that they would like to move forward in a reasonable and effective way to consider the important issues of gambling. That received some media attention at the time. Certainly we had a discussion in this place about what was happening—the change from what the previous government had put in place. The budget then took away money that had been allocated by the previous government in this area, replaced by a promise from the incoming government that they would take us down a reasonable and responsible path towards finding some solutions. I say, 'Let's get on this path.' Let us get on this path so the kinds of issues that Senator Xenophon is talking about can be dealt with. Let us look at the evidence that has come forward and let us undertake engagement so that we can understand exactly what is going on in this disputed space. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I shared a number of weeks on the community affairs committee with Senator Xenophon and other senators, all of whom were genuinely concerned about problem gambling in Australia. There was no doubt about that. There was no difference between the senators. In hearing them talk about the issue, you would not have been able to tell which party they belonged to or which group they represented. Certainly they took a genuine interest in these issues. We sat there for a number of hearings. First we heard, 'The sky is blue', and then we heard, 'The sky is black'—nothing, there was no agreement. As I said, what we have is an unresolved dispute. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have a commitment from the new government to put in place this new, responsible process to look at gambling issues in our community. Well, we have been waiting—because there are many of us who would like to walk down this path together with the government in a responsible and responsive way. So far there has not been a lot of action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly I believe the issue that Senator Xenophon has raised in this bill, which is the opportunity for criminal behaviour and money laundering to occur in our clubs, specifically around gaming machines, is a real issue. We need to see whether it is accurate and can be backed up by evidence and then balance that against the kinds of arguments we have heard pretty consistently from the clubs industry, which is about what impact bringing in yet another level of regulation would have on their business, their viability and the pleasure they provide to a number of people. If we are going to have a responsible, cooperative approach, then I stress this one paragraph we received from the government which talks about this new process 'engaging all stakeholders'. This has to happen. If you have heard me speak on this issue before, Mr Acting Deputy President, then you would know it has been the major process I have put on the table: we must engage all stakeholders. So far, I do not think we have been able to come up with any kind of common approach in this area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In hindsight, whilst our Senate community affairs process followed the standard model where we invite people to put in submissions, we call for public hearings, we have them, we put all the evidence together and then we talk about where we will go with our report—and I would think it is a very similar process to that of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform—we did not get the people together at any of these hearings. We heard sequential pieces of evidence from witnesses who were putting forward their own views. It should be done with everyone together, with the senators, so that we can see how people are interacting and responding to particular positions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this case, the kinds of evidence that Senator Xenophon has concerns about is money laundering, the ease with which this could happen and the fact that, under the current provisions of the act, AUSTRAC would not be able to gather evidence into their process for consideration. I think it probably would be more useful to hear those voices together, not speaking over each other—which sometimes happens when we get excited in these processes—but face-to-face so that we can ask questions in an engaging way rather than one where we hear the evidence, we close it off, we sit down and we do not have a chance to say, 'What do you think about that?' So perhaps in the responsible and reasonable way that the government has said they are going to move forward on the gambling issue, we could look at having some cooperative process whereby we get people who care about the issue together. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would be particularly interested to hear more about the evidence that Senator Xenophon has just put forward, because if that kind of information has been put forward by researchers it would be useful to see the reaction to it by people who one would expect from previous experience would not share a similar consideration. This could be such a process, and I think many people would like to be engaged in it. Again, I stress that the difference is not the concern about people who are damaged by problem gambling. The difference is certainly not any concern about whether there should or should not be illegality in our registered clubs—and I think that is clear. In fact, in their submission to Senator Xenophon's Senate select gambling reform bill, Clubs Australia were very quick to point out that they actually take their legal responsibility particularly seriously and that they already have a relationship with AUSTRAC that is focused on ensuring that there are minimal opportunities for the kinds of issues Senator Xenophon describes in terms of people being able to launder money—money that would have been obtained in an illegal way and then put into legal tender so that it could be used in other ways. 'Cheque change' is one process whereby you can cash a cheque and then use that money in other ways. The clubs were clear that it was not common practice in their business. We need to see what evidence they have for that view, as opposed to the concerns about what could happen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that was raised—and this widens the whole thing—is that Senator Xenophon<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s bill is particularly about gambling machine venues, and we heard that consistently. I know that a series of the bills put forward by Senator Xenophon at the time were looking mainly at the area of gambling machines. If these things are occurring and there is an opportunity for people to invest money and for it to be used in ways that are illegal or inappropriate then surely that should exist across the board in all gambling areas. My experience of the gambling world is walking through a casino, and my observation of the activities while on those walk-throughs is that there are a whole range of temptations for people who want to be involved in gambling—and they are not just in the machine area where people can win significant amounts and then get into the kind of temptation that Senator Xenophon has specifically pointed out in his bill around gambling machines. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Xenophon well knows, this debate will continue into the future in whatever way it will do so. At this stage, we are not supporting the bill in its current form. What we are supporting is that there needs to be continued action, because the problem has been identified. The reasonable and responsible response has yet to be identified. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The progress report on the Implementation and Administration of the National Disability Insurance Scheme was written by the Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS, of which I am a member, and I commend the secretariat for their assistance. I also want to commend the staff of the National Disability Insurance Agency, service providers, carers, and of course the people with a disability who have worked so hard to see the NDIS dream become a reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS represents a milestone in Australian history. It was designed and launched by the previous Labor government in recognition of the fact that people with a disability deserve a fair go. They deserve the opportunity to actively take part in work, school and community life, and they deserve the individual support needed to do this. This is exactly what NDIS offers—a unified system that identifies and prioritises the needs of the individual; a system that promises Australians with a disability, their families and their carers more control over their lives, more certainty over their care and more opportunities to contribute productively to the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS report before us today logs the first steps toward the full rollout of this landmark initiative and gauges how we are progressing. It is the result of evidence the committee gathered from public hearings in the Barwon, Hunter, South Australian and Tasmanian trial sites in April and May. Today, I would like to talk about the progress of the rollout in Tasmania, which on 31 March was on track to support 1,000 Tasmanians with a disability aged between 15 and 24 in its first year. This is a particularly important trial that will inform future NDIS rollouts across the country on how we can best support our young people with a disability as they transition from school to work or further training. From 2016, the rollout will be opened up to other people with a disability. It is predicted that it will support more than 10,000 Tasmanians in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report notes the success of the Tasmanian rollout in effective planning, objectives being met, dramatically reduced waiting lists and great feedback from participants. It also recognises that the groundwork for these great outcomes was laid very early on. This was helped by comprehensive data from both the state government and the gateway service for people with disabilities. It meant that tailored consent processes and early planning measures could be devised well in advance of launch.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another great strength of the Tasmanian rollout has been its effective engagement strategy which has resulted in strong relationships with a wide range of stakeholders. In fact, the committee believes the Tasmanian engagement strategy offers a good model for other areas to replicate. The report also notes that, with the exception of those seeking housing and respite services, there are no waiting lists for the Tasmanian trial site.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most worthwhile achievement outlined in the report is that the Tasmanian rollout is meeting the needs of its participants. In fact, 95 per cent of those surveyed indicated strong satisfaction in the process and outcomes they have had to date through the trial. This is an impressive statistic indeed, but perhaps the words of Mr John Coyle tell the more important human story. Mr Coyle is the father and full-time carer of three children, two of whom have severe intellectual difficulties. Here is what he said about the experience of his family with the NDIS rollout in Tasmania:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With the advent of the NDIS we are given a lot more individual control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We go armed with the funding; so, when we approach a service provider, we are spoken to differently, we can tailor our situation and my children's development can be targeted … That was non-existent before …</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I would like to take a few moments to talk about the Community Affairs References Committee's report into Out-of-pocket costs in Australian healthcare. I think it is important that I spend a few moments to outline this report, because the committee heard important evidence which heavily criticised the coalition's attack on the universal health-care system that has held this country in good stead for 40 years. It highlighted just how out of touch this government is with the lives of everyday Australians. The committee made a number of recommendations, but the key recommendation was that 'the Government should not proceed with further co-payments.' The evidence was overwhelming in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence to the inquiry emphasised that, rather than discouraging 'overservicing' and reducing the number of 'unnecessary visits', the introduction of co-payments would have a negative impact on consumers' ability to access necessary primary health care services. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners provided the following evidence:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The federal government's proposed co-payment model is intended to reduce unnecessary general practice health service use. However, international studies demonstrate that, with the exception of the most vulnerable patients, there is limited evidence that co-payments actually reduce health service use. The economic rationale for implementing co-payments is further confounded by evidence suggesting that healthcare costs increase due to preventable conditions not being treated and poorer control of chronic disease and greater hospitalisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submitters and witnesses expressed concern that an increase in out-of-pocket costs in the form of a co-payment for GP services would result in people delaying seeking medical treatment. In its review of health care in Australia, the COAG Reform Council found that nationally, in 2012-13, 5.8 per cent of people delayed or did not see a GP for financial reasons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding an additional co-payment will exacerbate the situation and impact disproportionately on individuals with the greatest healthcare need, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, elderly people, women, people on low- or fixed-incomes and people with chronic illnesses. A $7 GP tax would also affect the viability of GPs in rural and regional areas and could lead to their closure. Mr Gordon Gregory, the Executive Director of the National Rural Health Alliance, told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we anticipate that a $7 co-payment will present a dilemma, especially for lone GPs in small rural and remote towns, and that the viability of these medical practices may be reduced, with consequences for access to health services in those towns. Further consideration of the impact of proposed new co-payments should therefore include their differential impact on people in rural and remote areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence provided to the inquiry indicated that people living in rural and remote areas are less able to pay out-of-pocket costs, resulting in a greater proportion of people in rural and remote areas postponing or not making visits to a health professional due to the costs. As a member of the committee, I was concerned about the evidence given about the effect that the $7 GP tax and other proposed government measures would have on my home state of Tasmania. I would particularly like to highlight the evidence given by the President of the AMA, Associate Professor Owler, who said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmania has a higher burden of chronic disease and higher smoking rates, and we need to do more to encourage preventive health care and chronic disease management. That is why I think the co-payment is probably going to affect Tasmanians more than it affects people in other jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Health clearly articulated what was wrong with the ideology behind the coalition's policy of a GP co-payment, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Basic economics suggests that, other things being equal, increased prices lead to decreased demand ... However in real world situations, particularly in health, other factors are not equal, and the relationship can be quite complex. In particular, demand is also influenced by income, and for superior goods like health, demand can be very elastic and grow faster than incomes. Moreover, not all health interventions have the same value and changes in aggregate demand may not impact on health outcomes if they reflect a 'swapping out' of less effective interventions for more effective interventions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing that the coalition senators chose to write a minority report that coincided with the government's own ideological position rather than the evidence given at the inquiry, because this inquiry clearly showed their thinking is flawed and they need to stop developing policies based on self-serving ideology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cost is currently preventing Australians from seeking the treatment that they need. Adding a GP tax will further increase the number of Australians delaying treatment—particularly the most vulnerable Australians. This will cause an exacerbation of their symptoms and they will present to hospital with more severe conditions at significant additional costs to the health system. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FAWCETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I rise to address the Senate Economics References Committee report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Future of Australia's naval shipbuilding industry</span>. Although I was not a member of that committee, I have read through the submissions and have been involved in this for some time. As a senator for South Australia, who is deeply concerned and involved in our defence industry and our Defence Force, I have a great interest in this topic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the reason that shipbuilding is important is the capability it gives us in a number of areas around the innovation of design and our abilities to sustain ships in a cost-effective manner and repair and modify ships as appropriate. It is not all ships, just as it is not all pieces of defence equipment, but the important part is that to be a sovereign nation we need to understand the competence and capacity that we need in our engineering workforce—whether they be in industry or in uniform—and in the infrastructure and capacity of the industry to perform certain functions. The way we achieve that moving forward is to avoid the bookended projects we have had in the past and that we have seen in things like our air warfare destroyer and how that start-stop approach has killed off the investment in skills and infrastructure that we build for a given project. The project stops, it all dies and then we face cost and risk when we start to try and rebuild that capacity down the track. There is a clear case to have an ongoing plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the arguments that I believe is important to take on board is that the defence industry provides one of the fundamental inputs to our defence capability. Very welcome side products of having a defence industry here are jobs and investment in the economy, but we need to bear in mind the government's primary responsibility is the national security of Australia. The reason we should be concerned and should take an interest in the viability of the defence industry is that they are a fundamental input into defence capability. We need to understand what the elements are of the defence industry that need to be viable in order to keep our Defence Force viable. I have put forward a number of papers and discussions around the fact that the Capability Development Group should actually have ownership of planning out over the next 20 years—not just for the life of one project, but over multiple projects, over at least a two-decade period. In a rolling fashion, they should be updating: 'What are the investments that the government needs to encourage industry to make, and, where necessary, the government needs to make, to have the engineering and manufacturing competence and capacity that is required to support our Defence Force?' If we get that right, then not only will our Defence Force have more effective and available capabilities; we will have better-informed decision-makers within the military, and within government, which is the basis of being a sovereign nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, if we choose the right projects to invest in, to have that work done onshore, we will have a better return to the economy. I would just like to talk through that a little more. Professor Goran Roos, who is now based in South Australia but has worked extensively overseas, brings a focus to work that has been done in northern Europe, has been done in North America and has been done in the UK, where, for defence projects—and I highlight here that we are talking about defence projects—there is a strong case that can be made that the second-order effects, or those spillover effects, of investing in industrial innovation and capacity in a country, returns to that economy, over a period of time—a decade or more—multiples of anything from around 1.6 in the UK for their shipbuilding, through to multiples of up to six in the US for some of their aerospace projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This does not hold for other sectors. People often quote the automotive sector and argue that spillover effects cannot be measured and are not effective—and we just have to look at the money that has been invested in people like Holden and Ford here, and yet they are closing down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference between other sectors and Defence is that, in other sectors, the public have the option to choose whether or not they will purchase those cars. If they want to go and buy a Hyundai or a BMW they can do that. So there is not a certain market. There is also not a certain time frame for a particular product that is developed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this works and can be quantified for Defence is that you have one customer, who is normally going to operate a piece of equipment for at least 10 to 15 years—sometimes 20 to 30 years—and so you have an almost guaranteed quantity that are going to be acquired. You have a through-life-support program put in place. You have an upgrade cycle put in place. So all the elements that contribute to second-order effects are there in a Defence acquisition. That is why it stands alone compared to others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this works for some projects, not all. For projects that are low-complexity and that do not involve a lot of innovation, the theories and the quantifiable effects are not there, which is why we should not necessarily rush to try and do everything in Australia. But there are some areas where complex projects, requiring systems integration and innovation, clearly have—and it is demonstrable and measurable—the spillover effects that will give us those engineering skills that will deliver the ability for us to be a smart customer, to have the sovereign capability as a nation to understand our equipment—its shortcomings; its effectiveness—so that our war-fighters have the best equipment, and the decision-makers—whether they be logisticians, people involved in the sustainment, or at a political level—have the information they need to make decisions that are in the best interests of the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of examples that I can provide in both the maritime and particularly the aerospace sector, which is my own background, where the ability to understand, modify and certify aircraft has saved the Commonwealth significant amounts of money. Where we have lost those engineering competencies because we have not planned this out over time, we see disaster—for example, the collapse of the amphibious fleet in 2011. Navy has now had to spend a large amount of money trying to recreate and restore the engineering and technical competencies to actually understand and oversee the engineering to ensure the seaworthiness of its ships. So there is an investment that is appropriate for governments to make in the engineering competence and capacity in both uniform and industry, if we are going to sustain the capability. And that, fundamentally, is why we should be supporting shipbuilding here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the particular terms of reference of this inquiry: it was looking at the supply ships and looking at why they were not built here in Australia. Looking through the submissions, one of the things that I see, and it is a constant theme, is that people such as BAE Systems and ASC—some of the major shipbuilders here—recognise that they could not deliver in the time frame that the government needed in order to replace the supply ships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The time frame is important, as we see if we look at the decision points to actually get ships into service. The AWD is currently just past the peak of its workforce engagement. The decision to actually get ASC to be the shipbuilder was made in 2005. The decision on the design going to Navantia was made in 2007. So, 2005 to 2007 to now—we are talking seven to nine years between those two decisions and now. So, clearly, if we wanted a project to continue that workforce and that investment, the supply ships project was never going to cut it because it would not be delivered in time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the way forward to actually sustain that investment—that has been made, to their credit, by the South Australian government in Techport, in ASC, by BAE Systems and others, in the ability to design and manufacture ships, or to understand the design and manufacture of ships—is the future frigate project. The reason that that is viable is that—with the investment that the government has made, of some $78 million, to establish the viability of integrating the CEA radar and the Saab 9LV combat system into the existing AWD hull—that means that we could commission, early on, the manufacture of hull blocks which will keep those skill sets going. When the fit-out of the three AWDs is finished, we then start looking to assemble and fit out the hull blocks for future frigates. What we start generating is economies of scale. We have proven with the Anzac project that we are capable of equalling, if not bettering, world's best practice in productivity. But it always takes a number of ships. So by continuing the lineage of that design around the hull, by integrating Australian systems, we achieve a continuity of build, which gets a return on the investment we have made in those skills and capability. It gives us the kind of engineering competence and capacity to deliver sovereignty to the nation, good capability to Defence and a return, importantly, to the Australian economy, which for South Australia would also have the flow-on effect of those jobs. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us make no mistake about this. The decision made by the government on the basis of advice from the Defence Materiel Organisation not to even allow Australian companies to tender for the $1.5 billion supply ship contract is a disgrace. It does not make sense to me that they be excluded entirely. It does not make sense to me that Australian companies did not even have a chance to be part of a competitive tender process. It is a gobsmackingly stupid decision by the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I have a lot of respect for the integrity, the decency and the competence of our Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. I think he is a good man who is doing his best, but somehow this decision was made. I do not want to focus my remarks on Senator Johnston because I suspect, although I have no evidence for it, that there were other forces at play, that, in relation to this particular decision, the bean counters won, that the DMO won the day, and that really concerns me. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put this decision in perspective. The Australian government is effectively saying that Australian companies are not worthy, are not good enough to put in a tender for a $1.5 billion contract—$1.5 billion worth of shipbuilding with a huge strategic, economic and social impact on this nation. We heard evidence at the inquiry from local shipbuilders. We heard evidence from the Australian industry that they could have been part of this, that they could have participated in this. It was put to me privately that, for instance, the Australian industry could have participated in this project with a joint venture with overseas shipbuilders—maybe the hull could have been made overseas, given the time constraints, but that the fit out, the technology, the electronics, the various capabilities within that vessel all could have been done here in Australia, so that a significant proportion of the $1.5 billion could have been spent here in Australia. We heard from Senator Fawcett about the potential multiplier effect. We heard from him that it could vary from 1.6 to seven in terms of the number of other jobs it could create, the economic activity that could drives, let alone the skills base that it could build and let alone the strategic significance of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put it into perspective, Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards, as a fellow South Australian senator. We are in deep trouble in our home state of South Australia with the impending departure of General Motors Holden as an automotive manufacturer in South Australia. We are losing skills. I know of smart car designers and engineers who are already going overseas because the jobs will not be here in three years time. We know that in South Australia there are many thousands of jobs in the component sector, directly between 7,000 and 10,000 and indirectly in tier 3 and 4 manufacturers, thousands more—a huge economic impact on South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that unless we ensure as a matter of urgency that there is a sufficient fund to allow those industries to transition, to make other things, other than for General Motors Holden, for Toyota or for Ford in Victoria, as they do, there will be mass job losses; there will be a massive impact on the South Australian economy. I do not understand why the federal government, in addition to ripping $500 million from the Automotive Transformation Scheme as part of their election promise, took another $400 million from the Automotive Transformation Scheme in the budget. I put on notice to this government that I will oppose that resolutely, I will oppose it every way possible to ensure that those cuts do not go through. I am grateful for the discussions I have had with Senator Kim Carr from the opposition, whose passion for manufacturing is well known. We need to ensure that those cuts do not take place and we also need to ensure that ships are built in Australia, that submarines are built in Australia and, as much as possible, in South Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Fawcett's contribution made a very good point about the capabilities and made a very good point about the fact that when you are building something you build up the skills and expertise, that to judge our shipbuilding industry by the first ship or the first submarine that is built is not fair because that is not how it works in the real world. We know that expertise and efficiencies are built up as you go along. If there are labour practices that could be improved, if productivity gains are to be made, then so be it. I am all for that, but not to allow the Australian shipbuilders to even tender for a $1.5 billion supply ship contract is extraordinary. It is a vote of no confidence by the DMO, by the Australian government in our shipbuilding industry </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the ordinary man or woman in the street, if they heard that, would be scratching their head and saying, 'Why wasn't Australian industry given a chance, a fair go, to even compete for this tender process?' I know that Warren King, the head of DMO, has been around for a long time, but I do not accept his rationale for the decision. I think the rationale could be summed up as: 'We didn't want to put Australian industry to the expense of putting in a tender process.' How insulting!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that we put it into perspective as well that, for every dollar spent on local defence procurement, there is a huge impact on our local economy. A study done in the United Kingdom indicated that, for every pound spent on local UK defence procurement, there was a return to the exchequer, the treasury of the UK, of 37 per cent. That is the magnitude we are looking at. So even if a ship is a bit more expensive to build in Australia, the economic benefits are still overwhelmingly in favour of it being built here—let alone the strategic significance of it being built here. We are losing our engineers in the automotive sector. We are losing our expertise in manufacturing. If we lose our shipbuilding, if we lose our submarine capacity, it will be a disaster for Australian industry and for my home state of South Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank, and acknowledge the role of, Chris Burns, the head of the Defence Teaming Centre in SA. He has been a champion for the local defence industry and has spoken fearlessly on behalf of local defence contractors. In fact, what he has said resonates across the country. He is a highly competent and articulate representative for the industry and his views ought to be heeded by government. His submission, and his evidence, was incredibly powerful, yet it appears that it has been ignored by government. What Mr Burns told the committee needs to be heeded. We need to look at having some certainty for the industry. If we do not, the valley of death will be upon us. We will lose thousands of jobs that we will never get back and we will lose that critical defence capability, which will be a national tragedy. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

I have spoken to many people in the community and the industry about the report and about the media coverage. One thing I would like to say up-front is that I recognise and want to put on the public record that there are many financial advisers, both in large vertically integrated companies and in small independent operations, who work ethically, who work hard and who work for the best interests of their clients.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst there a few who are the cause of the worst action—in the Commonwealth Bank and others; recently Macquarie Bank has been in the news—the report does highlight, from a governance perspective, the role of the regulator and, particularly in the larger organisations, the role of the board, the senior management, the supervisors and the remuneration structures that are put in place. All of those things combine to either encourage or allow certain cultures and behaviours within organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report had a large number of recommendations. One recommendation in particular that has affected my committee was that we take on an inquiry looking at raising professional standards in the education of financial advisers. We have done that. We have called for submissions and we are starting to receive submissions from people in the industry. That is important because, at the moment, after doing a very brief course, RG146, in under two weeks you can have a qualification that enables you to work in a sector where you are advising people on their life savings, which can run into the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars. I think the ordinary person on the street would expect that somebody who is going to be advising you on those things would have a higher level of training, qualifications and experience if you are going to entrust your life savings to them. I am pleased in that regard to see that, in recent weeks, some of the large financial organisations have come out ahead of our inquiry and said they recognise that they need to professionalise and they are going to start setting some benchmarks and looking at tertiary qualifications as well as ongoing professional development for their members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry will have an important job to do to try and coalesce the interests of people who are working in the small independent firms, people in the large integrated firms and people who work in the self-managed superannuation space to make sure that we find a common landing ground for how that would work—who regulates it? Is it going to be regulated by industry? Is it going to be regulated by ASIC? Who sets the standards? Who enforces those? Who oversees ongoing professional development? How do we grandfather people who in some cases have been working very successfully and very ethically in the industry for many years but do not have a tertiary qualification? How do we bring them in? There is a body of work to do and I look forward to that engagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to make the point that the report has provided for my committee, for ASIC and for industry a wealth of information about things that can go wrong in the governance of an organisation and in the oversight of the regulator. One of the things that my committee is doing, which I will be working with ASIC to do, is going through that report and identifying—not just the recommendations, but looking at the submissions and looking at the discussion by the committee—all the various aspects of behaviour, of governance, of how the regulator oversees the industry, to see what it is that we can learn. What is it that we can adapt, change or improve so that we reduce the burden of regulation whilst, at the same time, improve the quality of the outcomes? For the consumer the quality of the outcomes that we are looking for is advice around their financial circumstances that is suitable for them, widely available, and affordable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the financial services inquiry is also looking at some of these areas and is even looking at things like the structures of the financial services sector and whether the existing structures are right. It is an area that is in considerable flux at the moment. As a government, we have a dual responsibility where we have to seek to change but not for change sake, because every change we make has a flowthrough cost for industry. Every time there is a change in regulation the impact for those in back of house to their systems, their training, their IT systems, their personnel, is huge and can cost, in some cases I am told, into the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions of dollars in terms of whole-of-system changes. We have to be very careful that the changes we make are needed and are targeted so that we achieve the outcome for the consumer without increasing regulation, without dampening competition and without putting unfair impost on the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commend the secretariat of the committee who took evidence from a wide range of people both from the industry and from those who had been affected by poor financial advice. I would like to thank the officers from ASIC. ASIC comes in for a fair hiding at different times. The public expectations of what they should be doing in a whole range of areas—whether it be information, enforcement, auditing or investigations—are very high. Yet they are an organisation with a limited capacity. I have seen a willingness to increase their learning on how they respond to and how they react to, for example, whistleblowers and to things like enforcement and increased transparency. There is a range of people here who have contributed to what this report represents. It provides a good basis for ongoing development work by the parliament, by ASIC and by industry, all of which, I trust, will be to the benefit of the consumers in Australia who need this financial advice to plan and to provide for their future. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not support the Education and Employment Legislation Committee's report tabled today on the provisions of the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Measures) Bill (No. 2) 2014. We do not support this majority report which focused on childcare benefit, and I will present my reasons as to why we do not support it. I commend the Labor senators' dissenting report which gives an accurate report about the impact of freezing the income eligibility thresholds for childcare benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that Australian children have a right to good quality, accessible and affordable early childhood education and care, and we further believe that children and families have a right to a quality educator. After all, many children spend longer in childcare services than their brothers and sisters do in school. In order to retain quality educators Labor believes in paying educators a decent, professional wage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, Labor undertook major reforms in the early childhood education and care sector and part of those reforms are still underway. Our reforms focused on improving educational outcomes for Australian families. The early childhood education and care sector has overwhelmingly endorsed Labor's reforms. Labor improved staff qualifications, improved staff-to-child ratios, introduced a national Early Years Learning Framework and a new outcomes based accreditation system. Through the COAG process states and territories introduced national early childhood and education laws. Labor, through its Early Years Quality Fund, took a first step in addressing the poverty wages in early childhood education and care which left many workers well under the poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government has already abolished the Early Years Quality Fund and seems set to roll back Labor's improvements against the wishes of the sector. Despite promises before the election, all the Abbott government has done is cut $1 billion out of childcare assistance for Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen cuts to family day care and we have seen cuts to outside school hours care. And then we have the accessibility fund, which was actually designed to increase childcare places. When the government was in opposition the now minister criticised the fund and in fact sat on that report from September of last year; yet earlier this week—Tuesday, I think—praised the report, which looked at how you might reduce some of the barriers that local government have in fast-tracking applications and making sure that there are enough early childhood places for Australian working and studying families. Minister Ley first criticised Labor's initiatives and then praised them. And the cuts go on. We have seen the Indigenous Child and Family Centres in Western Australia and across the nation severely cut, and we heard Senator Sterle speak about those earlier in the week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the most recent one—and the one we had the inquiry into—was the childcare rebate. Minister Ley is still singing from the Abbott government's old broken promises and litany of lies song sheet with this lie on Tuesday, where she said in her media release:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:9.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The Abbott Government is committed to making child care more affordable</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When? Not in this budget and not with $1 billion worth of cuts. The Prime Minister's latest cut to child care currently before the parliament is a cut to the means-tested childcare benefit. It is an attack aimed directly at low- and middle-income Australians—the same people who are already doing it tough and feeling the pain of the Prime Minister's harsh budget. This is another attack on families. There was no warning before the election. No government has ever before either moved to cut or freeze the childcare benefit. Families should not have to pay the price for the Abbott government's inability to get their budget through the parliament. Prime Minister Abbott should keep his pre-election promise and reverse the $1 million cuts to early childhood education and care—something which families rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we did the inquiry earlier this week, the department appeared as witnesses and gave us evidence. You would think that, if the government were going to make it much more difficult for families to find their out-of-pocket expenses by freezing the wage eligibility of the childcare benefit, they would have some very solid research that they could present to the committee. But, no, despite questions during Senate estimates, despite questions since and despite questions earlier this week at the hearing, the department—and therefore the government—have no modelling at all other than a bit of a guess to let the committee and the public know what the cuts will mean for families. They were able to say that about half a million families would be affected. That is a staggering number of families who are already reeling under other cuts in the harsh, cruel Abbott budget that are hitting low- and middle-income families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The department were not able to demonstrate to the committee the justification or to present modelling to tell us exactly which families, when and how—which you would expect when you are taking a million dollars out of a program. The government should be able to demonstrate very clearly how they arrived at that figure and what the damage will in fact be. But the department have not done any modelling. They have no intention of doing any modelling and they certainly did not have any modelling to share with us earlier this week at our committee hearing. This is despite overwhelming evidence in other childcare inquiries and overwhelming evidence presented through submissions that the cuts to the childcare benefit, which is aimed at low-income families, is really going to hurt families using child care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought that maybe the government had some other targeted program that they wanted to put this money into—maybe the family and children services that Senator Sterle spoke about—and that maybe they were going to find the million dollars needed in Western Australia to continue to support those childcare centres. But when we asked where the savings from the cuts to the childcare benefit were going to go, they did not know. The freezing of the eligibility to the childcare benefit has been around since the budget—more than 100 days—and still the department were not able to tell us where that money would go, other than to other government priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What could be more important than supporting young children into quality early childhood education and care in this country? Indeed, before being elected as Prime Minister of this country, that is what Tony Abbott, as the opposition leader at that time, committed to do. What he has done ever since then is the complete opposite. Taking money from the early childhood sector is a bad move. It will impact families. We will potentially see women who work part-time having to cut their hours and therefore reduce the family's income or we may see families being pushed into backyard unregulated care—and that would not be in anyone's best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence on the positive impact that early childhood education and care has on children's brain development is absolutely clear. Children benefit from quality care. Yet our Prime Minister is making that much, much tougher for Australian families, particularly those on low income. There is also plenty of evidence to say that kids from low-income families also benefit from this additional support. But, no, like many other budget measures, this is being ripped away from low-income families. They will suffer at the hands of the Abbott government. They will be the ones who have to pay more out-of-pocket expenses for child care—child care which is already way to expensive. And this is from a government that committed to do better. Well, when? That is the question that we ask. I commend the Labor senators' dissenting report, and I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>

I am speaking of AIDS 2014, the premier international gathering that brings together renowned experts working in the HIV field around the globe, along with policy and decision makers, those who are living with the reality of HIV in their lives as well as others with an interest and commitment to ending HIV.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conference is held every two years and is widely acknowledged by those working in HIV research and policy as the pre-eminent gathering of experts. Australia should be proud to have hosted such a prestigious event and for the opportunity to share with delegates our nation's success in the fight against HIV, which has always been a strongly community-driven effort. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conference, held in Melbourne from 20 July to 25 July convened around 14,000 delegates, including around 1000 media representatives. I was enormously pleased to have the opportunity of attending several days of the conference to discuss Australia's efforts in this field with those from other countries and to learn from each other's stories. I did so in my capacity as chair of the Parliamentary Friends of HIV/AIDS, Blood Borne Viruses and Sexually Transmitted Diseases. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were presentations from renowned scientific and medical experts, policy makers and those recognised as driving forces in campaigning to end discrimination against those suffering from HIV and AIDS. There were also high-profile speakers who provided keynote addresses during the days of the conference, including former Justice of the High Court Michael Kirby, former President of the United States of America Bill Clinton and musician Sir Bob Geldof, whose commitment to improving health and lives in Africa is particularly well-understood and well-documented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, of course, the conference began on a particularly sombre note. The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was a tragedy for many nations around the world, not least our own, with the loss of 38 of our fellow Australians. This senseless tragedy also had a direct bearing on the AIDS 2014 conference. Six of those lost aboard MH17 were en route to Melbourne to participate in the conference. Among them were the World Health Organization's media officer, Glenn Thomas, as well as Dr Joep Lange, a former president of the International AIDS Society who had been involved in the fight against HIV from the very beginning. His work was crucial in the development of the antiretroviral therapy that is integral to the treatment of HIV today. Dr Lange was also a key force in the development of methodologies to prevent mother-to-child transmission. His passing, and that of his partner, Dr Jacqueline van Tongeren, is an incalculable loss to the field of HIV research globally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opening session of the conference paid tribute to these and three other Dutch delegates who lost their lives in the tragedy. The conference proceeded inspired by the spirit of their dedication to ending the HIV epidemic around the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opening plenary address given by the Hon. Michael Kirby was all at once moving, insightful, elegant and engaging. I would encourage my fellow senators to obtain a copy and read it, because there are clear messages in it for all of us. The standout message is a simple one—'We are in this together.' Just as HIV-AIDS does not discriminate between classes, races or geographic boundaries, Michael Kirby clearly articulated that not one side of politics has a monopoly on wisdom and compassion when it comes to the fight against AIDS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's initial response to AIDS—which came at a time when we knew very little about the condition and fear and panic abounded in some quarters—was forged in an atmosphere of bipartisanship. It is a credit to both major parties that they had within them people of the calibre of the then Minister for Health, Labor's Neal Blewett, and his opposition counterpart, Dr Peter Baume, who worked together to develop Australia's response, which is now widely acknowledged as being one of the more effective in our global community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this particularly in an international context because, as we know, there were some countries in the 1980s, when the disease first emerged, where political parties used fear of HIV-AIDS as a political weapon. There are still countries where this is the case, and I will come that shortly. I am pleased that this approach has endured for the past three decades through governments of both political hues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a political conservative myself, I am particularly grateful to Michael Kirby for shining light on the fact that conservatives have played a leading role in the fight against HIV-AIDS, because it is not a point that is usually underlined in much of the commentary on the issue. But as Michael Kirby's speech pointed out, it was President George W Bush in the United States who established the PEPFAR Fund and who in retirement continues to provide leadership and promote the Global Fund that has helped save millions of vulnerable lives, especially in Africa. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was also pointed out, a conservative, conviction politician, such as our present Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, is also well placed to talk to certain political leaders at forums, such as CHOGM or the G20, to persuade them to take real action in their own countries to abandon the politics of fear in this area. They are more likely to be persuaded by him than by their political opponents was the suggestion. Given the Prime Minister's long record of commitment to the fight against HIV-AIDS, I am sure it is an opportunity he will not overlook. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all the progress that has been made in this country, both in the medical fight against HIV and the fight against discrimination, there remains an alarming number of countries in our world that continue to pursue policies that cause great harm to many of their citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians would be shocked to learn that around four out of every five countries who are members of the Commonwealth, which itself accounts for 30 per cent of the world's population, still view homosexuality as a criminal offence. The Commonwealth comprises 53 nations. Of these, 42 continue to criminalise homosexuality. Tomorrow, 29 August, is Wear It Purple Day, which is an opportunity to show support for young LGBTI people in the fight against bullying and discrimination by wearing an article of purple clothing. I hope that in doing that we can also pause for a moment to think about these issues in a global context, because, while the fight to eliminate bullying and discrimination in our own country goes on, the global fight is a much bigger and more daunting challenge. To illustrate that point, it is helpful to consider Commonwealth countries by region. In Africa, 16 Commonwealth countries criminalise homosexuality. In the Americas, it is 11 countries. The situation is dire in Asia, where every member country of the Commonwealth, eight in total, continues to punish homosexuality. Even in our own Pacific region, only four nations—ourselves, New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu—have decriminalised homosexuality. The other seven Commonwealth nations in our region continue to have anti-homosexuality statutes on their books.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While these laws are often not enforced in Pacific nations, especially in the manner in which they are in Africa and the Americas, that is of no comfort. The continued existence of these laws inhibits progress towards genuine equality, such as the introduction of anti-discrimination laws. Even if they exist in name only, these discriminatory laws nonetheless need to be removed. As some commentators have noted, it is richly ironic that the existence of these laws in many Commonwealth countries is not because of something indigenous to their cultures but through the import of British laws criminalising homosexuality that existed in the past but no longer exist. Likewise, there are religious influences at play in some of these countries. But, again, in many cases these are influences imported from Europe, which is now the only region among Commonwealth countries that is entirely free of laws that criminalise homosexuality. For those who are interested, I encourage you to read an excellent survey of this issue by Paula Gerber: 'Living a life of crime: the ongoing criminalisation of homosexuality within the Commonwealth'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has always been influential in Commonwealth affairs. We took a leading role in the Commonwealth's fight against apartheid in South Africa. We took a leading role in the fight against the atrocities and injustices of Mugabe's Zimbabwe during John Howard's time in office. The fight to rid Commonwealth nations of laws that discriminate against their LGBTI citizens, like those battles of the past, is ultimately a fight for equality, and it is one where Australia can and must again play a leading role. I am confident that this effort is one that will enjoy the support of all Australians. This nation's enlightened approach to fighting both discrimination and the scourge of HIV/AIDS and our geographic proximity to some of the worst perpetrators of discrimination should see us taking a leading role.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  It is a well-known fact of this place that I do not take adjournment very often, and, if I do, most people duck or get ready to sue me. But anyway, let's have a crack. I sat in your position yesterday, Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards, and I had to listen to a speech from Senator Canavan. I have to be honest with you. We all get tapped on the shoulder now and again: 'Go down there, make a contribution, burn up a bit of time, pretend you know what you're talking about.' Those of us who do not know what we are talking about will follow the script. Sadly, Senator Canavan did not, in my opinion. But he will have a chance to square the ledger with me; I am sure there are no dramas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I have to say, I could have chewed through a piece of two-by-four yesterday listening to some of the contributions and facts and figures that came from Senator Canavan. I just want to share this with you. Senator Canavan was talking about one of my favourite subjects. He had obviously had the call to go in there and chuck a hand grenade—and this is my opinion—and try to win over some of  the crossbenchers to support Senator Abetz's burning desire to get rid of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal—because we cannot have truckies getting paid! We cannot have the likes of Coles and transport companies paying their drivers to make sure that our roads are safe, make sure that our truckies are not overloading, make sure they are not speeding or taking illicit drugs or being forced to take shortcuts in terms of repairs and maintenance!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Canavan made the fatal mistake of grabbing a figure—and I do not know where he got this figure—and, in his desire to belittle the fine work of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, thought it was clever, in his opinion, to attack three members of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. One of them I do not know. Two of them I know very, very well, and most people in this chamber know one of them extremely well and hold that former senator in very high regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not have a lot of time, but I am going to spend the time sharing with other senators in this place the backgrounds of three of the people Senator Canavan attacked. He talked about Jennifer Acton, the president, who is the Hon. Jennifer Acton. Her husband was Bill Shorten's office manager. Senator Canavan had a crack at her. He also mentioned a former senator of this place and former TWU boss, Steve Hutchins, as being on the tribunal. He went on to mention Paul Ryan, who represents an employer body and is also 'reportedly close to the Transport Workers Union' and he said, 'All of these people are being paid in the order of $95,000 to sit on the tribunal.' Well, let's clear the air. Everyone knows that I am ex-TWU. Everyone knows I am a life member of the TWU. And everyone knows that I am an ex-truck driver. I did not go through university and say, 'Ooh, I think I want to be a senator'; I actually worked for a living—like some of my colleagues in this place, not all of them, but some, and like you too, Mr Acting Deputy President, and Senator Bilyk and everyone in the chamber now, and Senator Wacka Williams. Okay, we've got that one out of the way!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, Ms Acton—the Hon. Jennifer Acton—is a senior deputy president of Fair Work Australia. She has previously been the head of the Termination of Employment Panel and currently serves on the Industries Panel and the Organisations Panel. President Acton is also a member of the advisory board for the Centre for Employment and Labour Relations Law and the editorial committee for the Australian Journal of Labour Law. Since 1992 President Acton has also been a senior deputy president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. She was an industrial advocate for the ACTU for 10 years, and has a wealth of workplace relations experience. Nothing about TWU there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go on to another fellow who I do know very, very well—Mr Paul Ryan. I classify him as a good bloke, a mate. He gave me a few blues in Perth and a few brawls in his previous life at Mayne Nickless, and I will tell you what—he left me wounded a couple of times. I would not call him a great friend of the TWU, but I will let you decide. Paul Ryan has 20 years experience in industrial and workplace relations in the transport and logistics industry. He holds qualifications in commerce and law. After working for 10 years in the Commonwealth public service he joined Mayne Nickless, where he had responsibility for industrial relations in the freight and logistics group of that company—and I had plenty of experiences with him when he was with Mayne Nickless and they weren't all good, I am telling you, for me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He currently operates his own consultancy, Strategic Industrial Planning Services Pty Ltd, which provides industrial relations advice and assistance to companies—not to truckies, but to companies—working in the freight and logistics industry. He is national industrial adviser for the Australian Road Transport Industrial Organisation, which is not some mad left-wing union group of truckies who want to bash up bosses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get to my old mate, a mentor of mine, and a damned good bloke—former Senator Steve Hutchins. He had a crack at Steve as well, or 'Hutcho', as we have lovingly called him all of the years we have known him. Steve Hutchins is a former senator in the federal parliament representing New South Wales from 1998 to 2011. Amongst his various committee appointments he was a member of the Senate committee on road transport. He currently tutors in industrial relations at RMIT University. His experience with road transport began in 1977 at the transport company TNT—actually, so did mine; I did not know that—before becoming an official with the Transport Workers' Union New South Wales branch as assistant secretary and then secretary-treasurer. He subsequently became the federal president of the TWU as a senior member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. So if you want to have a crack, Senator Canavan, about my old mate Hutcho being close to the TWU, well, duh—we all knew that. But it is grossly unfair to attack Paul Ryan and accuse Mrs Jennifer Acton, or President Acton, of being TWU gumbies. I will chuck the 'gumby' word in, although he did not say that, but I have insinuated it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another misleading of the Senate, where you said they get $95,000. I thought: 'Crikey, Hutcho—if we could do a swap, that is not a bad gig, and you can have the Senate spot.' So I rang former senator Steve Hutchins, who wished he was getting paid $95,000 a year. I just want to correct the record and, Senator Canavan: don't make up figures, mate. It can get you into a lot of trouble. This is taxpayers' money, and I have it here from former senator Hutchins—he is paid $40,960 to be a member of that brilliant committee that is trying desperately hard to keep our roads safe, and there is a $615 meeting fee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a number of other ridiculous statements Senator Canavan made. In fact, if I wasn't sitting in your spot, I would have challenged him to take 40 steps to the right and make the statement out there where he is not protected by parliamentary privilege. I reckon he would have panicked and not done it. He also says—and I have to agree with him here—that 1217 people from the 12 months from March last year to this year have been killed in traffic accidents; spot on. He also says that his father-in-law is a truck driver; I reckon he must be a good bloke, then. And his uncle is a truck driver, so he must be a good bloke, too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if you are going to start talking as a truckie, let's be fair. There is only a handful of us in this place who could talk like that. Senator Williams is one, I am the other, and Senator Gallacher. We could probably find another truckie if we looked hard enough—maybe they drove a five-tonner at university, I don't know. But it is really disingenuous for any senator to come in here and cast ridiculous aspersions on people who are chosen for these positions. You may not like the legislation, those on that side. You may have difficulty with the thought of a road safety remuneration tribunal, which most of you, or some of you, have shared with us, and that is fine. But you don't, because you get the tap from the whip, come in here and start throwing mud around when it is ridiculously way off mark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity in the adjournment speech tonight to talk about the wonderful opportunity that I have taking kids on World War I tours through France and Belgium visiting numerous Commonwealth cemeteries where all of those brave boys now lie. I will get the opportunity again, hopefully, soon. But I could not let Senator Canavan's wild and ridiculous statements pass through this chamber, and I know I will be joined by you, Mr President. I certainly would not put words in your mouth, but to even try to degrade former Senator Hutchins, whom we all know and whose fine work we respect, is just a little bit out there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all ridden the rough and tumble; we have all had a good crack at each other here. Fortunately, most of it is smoke and mirrors and all for show—behind the scenes, we all respect each other—and most of us have relationships where, once we leave this place, there is something more important than sitting across the chamber throwing rocks at each other. It is our families that we go home to. But I just wanted to correct the record. Senator Canavan, I am happy to have another conversation with you. I acknowledge that you have been elected by the people of Queensland—good on you. Get your facts right. Get the figures right. It doesn't do any favours making it up.<span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator XENOPHON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  Earlier today Qantas, one of the world's great airlines, announced a record $2.84 billion loss—a staggering loss; a loss that appears to be inexplicable, given the role that Qantas has in Australian and world aviation. And what I would like to put to the Senate tonight and to the people of Australia is that, if Qantas needs to turn things around, it needs to get rid of Alan Joyce, the CEO; and Leigh Clifford, its chairman; and its board. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sir Rod Eddington, a former airline supremo—British Airways, for instance—made a point that in a service industry such as the airline industry you cannot succeed, if you declare war on your workforce. That is what Qantas management has done. Let's put this in perspective in terms of what has occurred. Alan Joyce today said that there will be a turnaround; that Qantas is about to turn the corner. He has said it before. He said it back in 2010. He said in August 2010 that 'international demand and yield across the business and leisure sectors continue to improve' and that there was an improvement in international business. In February 2011, Mr Joyce said, 'Qantas Airlines produced a strong revenue performance across both its international and domestic operations.' Yet by June 2011 Alan Joyce was saying that Qantas International was in terminal decline. In that four-month period there was a 27 per cent drop in the share price of Qantas, but not a peep was said to individual shareholders and small shareholders in Qantas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012 we heard announcements made about Jetstar Hong Kong getting off the ground. It is yet to get off the ground, and they have blown millions of dollars from aircraft sitting in Toulouse, France, at Airbus's headquarters because they have not got regulatory approval and it is unlikely they will get it any time soon. We know that back in 2012 Alan Joyce said of Qantas: 'We continue to work towards returning Qantas's international performance to profitability in the short term.' That was another 'turning the corner' statement. We know that in August 2012 Qantas said 'significant progress' was being made on an international turnaround plan. We know that on 18 October 2013, at the AGM for Qantas, Alan Joyce and Leigh Clifford got up and said things were looking good and that there was a clear strategy for Qantas to turn things around. Yet just seven weeks later, 49 days after that AGM, they made an announcement of a predicted loss of up to $300 million. In the meantime the share price has fallen by more than a quarter, but not a peep was said in the interim period to investors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is something that concerns me very much. That is why at the beginning of last month, on 8 July, I wrote to Mr Greg Medcraft, the chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, our corporate watchdog, raising a number of serious concerns put to me by employees of Qantas over the years in relation to the conduct of Qantas and whether Qantas has been complying with its statutory obligations in respect of continuous disclosure and the good faith provisions in section 184 of the Corporations Act. I did not raise these concerns with Mr Medcraft lightly. I raised them because there are many unanswered questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Senate inquiry process—and Senator Sterle was the chair of one of those inquiries—I asked Qantas management whether they had given briefings to institutional investors and whether those briefings were secret or not. Qantas responded on notice that those briefings were commercial-in-confidence. That is not good enough. If we believe in the stock market and a free enterprise system, small and large shareholders should be able to access the same information all the time. That is what continuous disclosure is about. Why should a mum-and-dad investor be left in the dark when institutional investors can get special commercial-in-confidence briefings? I think that is outrageous. There are 117,000 small, mum-and-dad investors with 10,000 shares or fewer in Qantas. There are many families around this country who have put their significant savings into Qantas on the basis of statements made by Qantas management, and they have been let down time and time again. I only hope that ASIC is able to thoroughly investigate the claims that I put to it. These are comprehensive claims in respect of inconsistent statements made by Qantas over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to put into perspective the Emirates tie-up. You may remember, Mr President, that one of the key turnaround strategies for Qantas was that it was going to have a tie-up with Emirates that would make a big difference to that airline. I made submissions to and appeared before the ACCC in relation to this because Qantas said that its international division was 'in terminal decline'. Guess what? The ACCC found that that assertion was not proven by Qantas. Let's look at what has happened according to the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics figures. In the first 12 months of the Qantas-Emirates tie-up, from 1 April 2013 to 1 April 2014, Qantas's passenger numbers into the country went up two per cent, even though the market grew much more than that. Emirates's numbers went up 18 per cent. Who got the better deal?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that secret, confidential briefings have been given to institutional investors to the detriment of small investors. If that is the case and the information contained in those briefings was material to the Qantas share price, that is a matter that ASIC must look at very closely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to comment on the whole issue of the shutdown of Qantas back in October 2011. It was a unilateral action by Mr Joyce that cost the airline some $200 million. I am not saying that the unions were blameless in relation to this, but it seemed to be an extraordinary action on the part of Mr Joyce. Interestingly—and these documents have been tabled in Senate committees—two weeks before the lockout, Qantas applied to the regulator of international routes to replace Qantas with Jetstar aircraft—in other words, a fully owned subsidiary. So maybe this has been Qantas's plan all along—to offshore and have Jetstar involved in these international routes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is also important to put into perspective that other airlines have done remarkably well. Air New Zealand's going gang busters. They announced a record profit just yesterday. They have really turned the corner. They are an airline that are not at war with their workforce. They work well with their workforce, and they announced a profit of NZ$260 million. That is a very significant profit, and that airline's projections are incredibly positive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to know what material and confidential briefings were given to institutional investors by Qantas and what information was excluded from the many tens of thousands of mum-and-dad investors. That is something that Senator Williams, who is in the chamber, has been a passionate advocate for—corporate accountability. He played a driving role in the ASIC inquiry, and I know this is something he has a particular interest in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put remuneration in perspective. Since Alan Joyce took over Qantas he has earned $22.2 million while the share price has fallen 40 per cent. His pay packet of $5.1 million in the last year we know of, 2012-13, was the combined pay packet, virtually, of Singapore airlines, Cathay Pacific and Air New Zealand, yet the Qantas share price has gone down 40 per cent since he became its CEO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a serious issue: 5,000 Australians will lose their jobs. Qantas is a national icon. It is our national flag carrier. I feel we have more bad news to come. What Alan Joyce has said cannot be believed. In my view, he is to Qantas what Caligula was to the Roman Empire. He is a person who has been part of the demise of a great Australian carrier. Notwithstanding that, Qantas still has outstanding individuals working for it—pilots, flight attendants and those on the ground. I pay my respects to them and I am sorry that they have to put up with such a shocking and appalling management.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I rise this evening to talk about my visit to the Richmond electorate, in my role as Nationals' duty senator for that seat, during the winter break. Don't you love that phrase 'winter break'? It is as though we do not do anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My first stop was Byron Bay, where I met with Byron Shire Council, which is thankful to the coalition for providing $200,000 from the Safer Streets Program for CCTV. The council will install the CCTV and additional lighting in Johnson Street, which is the main street, and also in Apex Park. Byron Bay is a very popular holiday spot and also a destination for schoolies week. Of course, with increased crowds and a bit of grog come problems. In fact a media report of April 2012 quoted police as saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Byron Bay is now one of the most violent places in the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At two o'clock in the morning, or between 11 and three, you have a far greater chance of being assaulted in Byron Bay by someone who's affected by alcohol than pretty much anywhere else in the State—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">of New South Wales. That is very concerning. In future, when people in Byron Bay want to engage in violence and give a bad name to a beautiful holiday town, they should expect the police to come knocking when they have been identified on CCTV.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was good to meet Mike, Virginia and Paul from EnviTE. EnviTE is the sponsor of four projects under the coalition's Green Army program and it will be working on revegetation and rehabilitation projects along the coastline in the Byron Bay area. There are four other projects in the Richmond area under the Green Army program. Not only are they good for the environment, each project provides work for up to 30 hours a week for nine participants plus a supervisor. The coalition government has committed $300 million over four years for the Green Army program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity to inspect some of the work underway on the Pacific Highway between Tintenbar and Ewingsdale. In the budget, the coalition confirmed $129 million for this section of the highway linking Byron Shire to the Ballina bypass. It means that Richmond will be the first electorate north of Newcastle in New South Wales to have a complete dual-carriageway highway. There is an enormous amount of traffic in this part of the state and it will flow much better when the highway upgrade is complete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Tweed Heads, Kennedy Drive is a very busy thoroughfare. At the last election the Nationals' candidate Matthew Fraser promised $3.3 million for the upgrade of a section of the drive, on which the coalition is delivering. I met with a number of councillors, including the mayor, Barry Longland, and the general manager, Troy Green. They explained what the $3.3 million federal contribution would go to. There is a lot more work to be done but it certainly is a good start. I know that Mayor Barry and General Manager Troy would be delighted that the Roads to Recovery funding can be rolled out, following the passing of the legislation today. I am sure they would have been quite concerned when they saw what the Labor Party and others were up to with the Roads to Recovery program. I am glad that that has been passed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most impressive projects, which has community and council support, is the concept of a rail trail from Casino to Murwillumbah, a distance of 132 kilometres. The rail line opened in 1894 and closed down in 2004. In April last year, a NSW government report suggested it would cost $900 million to restore the line to be able to take passenger services again. We know that is not going to happen. There is a community push for a rail trail, where people could walk, run or ride a bike or a horse and call in at the towns along the way. Communities are always looking for ways to increase tourism and I think this is a viable project. Imagine riding on a pushbike on a lovely, sunny Northern Rivers day and calling in at the small railway stations along the way to have a coffee, look at the local arts and crafts and even pop into town. Why couldn't the existing rails be taken up and sold off for scrap? Perhaps the ironbark sleepers could be sold for firewood. It is a good concept that I think would bring a lot of tourism to that region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tweed area is an extremely important area for sugarcane growing. In 2012, 4,300 hectares were harvested in the area surrounding the Condong plant, producing more than 300,000 tonnes of cane and 36,000 tonnes of sugar. The sugar growers are very concerned about the viability of the industry, because of changes in marketing arrangements, and they fear that their bottom line will be impacted on. Australian farmers are traditionally price takers, to their detriment. We have seen it in so many industries, and the dairy industry is one that comes immediately to mind. The cane growers are concerned about the impact of the large multinational companies affecting their bottom line. I said I would do what I could for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a really interesting chat with Bill Townsend from Coolabah Cooling. Bill made it clear he is neutral on the question of climate change but he knew one thing—the carbon tax was a stupid policy that had a huge impact on so many businesses like his. He made the point that the cost of refrigerants went through the roof when the carbon tax was introduced, which meant of course he had to charge more to cafes, restaurants, supermarkets and homeowners. Bill told me that in some cases people just did not get their fridges or their air conditioners fixed, or they thought that he was overcharging them and went elsewhere. The customers thought that Bill was ripping them off. That was not the case at all. He said it was like a cyclone had hit the industry. When the carbon tax was abolished he was left with a large amount of gas that he had purchased at the old higher price, but, of course, he could not expect his customers to pay the higher price. So he took a financial hit on it, but Bill said he would wear that just to be rid of the carbon tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank Matthew Fraser, Chairman of the Richmond Federal Electorate Council of the Nationals, for being with me for much of the tour. Matthew is a successful, young businessman who was recently elected President of Tweed Chamber of Commerce; he will do a great job. The Member for Richmond Justine Elliott could not contain herself; she criticised Matthew's election as being political. Ms Elliott, please do not criticise young Matthew because he is a great businessman and he works for his community in a great way. My many thanks go also to Alan Hunter and Rory Fraser for helping out on the Richmond tour .</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, I would like to pass on my congratulations to Madison Millhouse from Terranora in the Richmond electorate. Madison attended All Saints Anglican School and was one of the 500 Australian students named this week as winners of the 2013 Australian Student Prize. And while I am at it, I would like to place on record my congratulations to a young man from my home town of Inverell—Alexander Dimmock from Macintyre High School was also one of the 500 students to receive the prize. Well done to both Madison and Alexander.</span>
