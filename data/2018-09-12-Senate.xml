That contribution was an interesting one. I don't think that many would find it particularly persuasive.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government won't be supporting the Greens amendment. The government announced in the 2018-19 budget that it will extend the $20,000 instant asset write-off by a further 12 months, to 30 June 2019, for businesses with annual turnover of less than $10 million. This will improve cash flow for small businesses, providing a boost to their activity and investment for a further year. The Greens amendment would increase the threshold to $30,000 for assets relating to energy efficiency or clean energy, on an ongoing basis. The government's $20,000 instant asset write-off is widely supported by stakeholders and applies to all small businesses with an annual turnover less than $10 million. In extending the $20,000 threshold for a further year, the government has sought to strike a balance between helping small businesses' cash flow and investment and the revenue impact on the budget. We therefore don't support the amendment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  It is no surprise that neither the Labor Party nor the LNP will be supporting this amendment, because we know that they are fully ownedâ€”lock, stock and smoking barrelâ€”by the fossil fuel industry in this country. They both receive massive donations from fossil fuel companies. This amendment would encourage and incentivise small businesses to invest into infrastructure and assets that would result in an energy-efficiency dividend for small businesses, which would bring Australia's emissions profile down as well as improve the bottom line of small businesses. It would also encourage and incentivise small businesses to reduce their use of fossil fuels and to fuel-switch from gas to electricity. So it's no surprise at all that what we're getting from those political parties that accept large corporate donations is, once again, backing in of the fossil fuel sector and voting against an amendment that would ultimately deliver a more energy-efficient country, a more energy-efficient small business sector, and a country and a small business sector that would actually reduce their greenhouse emissions. Senator Seselja's been rewriting history once again in here this morning in regard to what happened in Tasmania. I had to put him over my knee last night when he tried to do that, and I'm going to do the same thing to him again this morning. I didn't hear everything he said, because I've just come from a meeting of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, but my friend and colleague Senator Whish-Wilson informs me that Senator Seselja's been at it again. Despite being schooled last night, he's going to have to be schooled again this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I want to make it clear that, in fact, the period of government between 2010 and 2014 in Tasmania was government for grown-ups. It was a government that Liberal leader and current Tasmanian Premier, the Hon. Will Hodgman, could have actually participated in, if he'd had a bit of spine, backbone and courage. Of course, on election night in Tasmania in 2010, Mr Hodgman got up and made a victory speech, and a fine victory speech it was, too. There was only one problem with it. Ten seats out of 25 doesn't give you a majority. In fact, he hadn't won; he'd lost. We all remember that speech, and Senator Bushby, I'm sure, remembers that speech as well. He might even have been there. I don't know. I was there when Mr Hodgman gave that speech, and I was having a good old giggle at it because I knew that 10 out of 25 does not equal 50 per cent. I knew that, but Mr Hodgman didn't know that, and he thought he could walk into government with 10 seats in a 25-seat lower house in Tasmania. History proved me right and proved him abjectly wrong and exposed his lack of understanding of basic mathematics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What did happen, ultimately, is the Greens and Labor got together and engaged in a government for grown-ups. What that government for grown-ups did was massively put the budget back on track. It engaged in taking on the forestry issue in Tasmania, something that successive majority governments had consigned to the too-hard basket for decades. And do you know what? We actually landed that issueâ€”something that had split our community apart and resulted in violence in our community and resulted in arrests, including my arrest back in the 1980s for protesting at Farmhouse Creek. Other people were arrested there and in other places. We were arrested defending our magnificent, globally unique forests, defending the carbon in those forests to ensure that it wasn't emitted and would contribute to the disruption of the climate that we are seeing today, and defending those forests on behalf of the people who actually own them, which is the Australian and Tasmanian people, not the governments of the day. Governments of the day are only ever temporary trustees of any public asset. We did it to stop the transfer of wealth from public to private, because, of course, for many decades in Tasmania, the more trees you chopped down, the more money you lost. That still applies today, with a massively subsidised and, in fact, mendicant forest industry in Tasmania.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In landing the Tasmanian forest agreement, in getting it through parliamentâ€”albeit in an imperfect way, because the upper house took the chainsaw to it when they had the opportunityâ€”what that government did was deliver hundreds of millions in investment into Tasmania, thanks to the federal government. That's hundreds of millions of dollars of investment that the Liberal Party is now running around trying to claim credit for. That's hundreds of millions of dollars that set Tasmania up for the future, with investment into tourism, investment into everything from cut flowers to berry production, and investment into transitioning the Tasmanian economy out of an overreliance on the old 'dig it up, chop it down' mentality that the Liberal Party love so much and into an economy that could thrive and prosper in the 21st century. When you look at Tasmania now, you seeâ€”and it's generally acceptedâ€”that our economy is moving forward in a more beneficial way not only for Tasmania but also compared to the rest of the country. And what's the major reason that is happening? It's that shot in the arm that was given to small businesses, tourism operators and primary producers in Tasmania, thanks to the hundreds of millions of dollars that flowed in through the Tasmanian Forest Agreement that the Liberal Party opposed. Senator Seselja has again displayed his extreme level of ignorance with regard to anything Tasmanian. I would have thought that Senator Bushby might have known a bit better, but clearly not. He should have advised his colleague Senator Seselja about the facts of the matter. I place on the record that I'm proud of the role the Greens played in that government. We delivered stable government. We addressed the primary challenges facing the state at the time.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The CHAIR:</span>  Senator McKim, I draw your attention to the amendment. You started off talking about the amendment. You have come close, and I appreciate that it's a wide-ranging debate, but perhaps you could focus more on the amendment before the Senate.</span>

                    </a>  I am, I believe, speaking in the main about small business, and, obviously, this amendment is with regard to providing more incentives for small business to become more sustainable. But just to complete the thought that I was engaged in: that period of government was government for grown-ups. It was a government that the Tasmanian people voted for comprehensively at the 2010 election, it was a government that took on all of the hard issues that had been left in the too-hard basket by majority governments of both political stripes in the past, and it was a government that, as I said, could have involved the Liberal Party, had Mr Hodgman had the backbone and courage to take it on. But instead, he had to sit there for four years on the opposition benches and impotently gnash his teeth every time the Labor-Greens government conducted itself in a way with which he disagreed. All of this was within the context of very difficult economic times for the whole country and particularly for Tasmania, the most export-exposed economy in the country, with a very high exchange rate between the US dollar and the Australian dollar.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very disappointing that neither the Labor Party nor the Liberal Party are prepared to support this amendment, but, as I said earlier, it is not surprising at all, because this is an amendment that is beneficial to small business, and we know that the Liberal and Labor parties are the parties of the big corporates, big business and the top end of town. The small business community, I might add, support the Greens' move for this scheme with a higher expenditure limit for renewable assets. That's important to place on the record, and has been placed on the record by Mr Peter Strong from COSBOA. As I said, it's disappointing but not surprising that the major parties in this placeâ€”who accept those tens of millions every year in corporate donationsâ€”are not prepared to support an amendment that would not only help small business but also help bring Australia's emissions profile down.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  I rise to urge the Senate to support Senator McKim's amendment, and make the point very clearly that the Greens have been the leaders on small business policy in this place over the last six years. You may not want to acknowledge that, Ministerâ€”through you, Chair. We brought the most comprehensive small business policy package to the 2013 election. That included a cut for real small businesses with a turnover of under $2 million, which make up the big bulk of my state of Tasmania's economy, that needed a leg-up. We worked with the small business community and COSBOA on accelerated depreciation and another 11 policies, and we took that package to the 2013 election. After the 2013 election, Senator McKim, my colleagues in this place, and I were all proud to vote for a tax cut for small business, and for accelerated depreciation for small business. There's a really important history here, Senator Seseljaâ€”through you, Chair. You should be taking this amendment seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're talking about how the Greens delivered for Tasmania, it's seldom acknowledged that the price on carbon, which is the international gold standard for action on climateâ€”and Senator Bushby would know thisâ€”delivered billions of dollars in windfall to Hydro Tasmania, who then paid a dividend to the Tasmanian government which funded schools, hospitals, policing and national parks. In fact, the Greens pretty much provided a lifeline to Tasmania's Treasury through a price on carbon. That has never been acknowledged in any public comment by the Liberal Party, who came in here and recklessly ripped up action on climate and billions of dollars of revenue to the Tasmanian government and to the Tasmanian people. That has never been acknowledged. Had that price on carbon gone into its final phase, after three years of being a carbon trading scheme, which is what it was set up to do, we would have had an official price on carbon. And we were that close to getting offsets for Tasmania's forests that would have been in the billions. The forests that Senator McKim, in his time in government, saved for the Tasmanian people, were eligible for offsets under the additivity principle, and there were advanced negotiations for the Greens to deliver billions of dollars to the Tasmanian economy. That was ripped up by the Liberal Party, with their cavalier attitude towards climate and the Tasmanian economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Senator Seselja, if you want to talk about economy-wrecking policies of the Greens, you should have a look at yourself and what you've done to my state of Tasmania. The hundreds of millions of dollars that we delivered through the diversification funds in the Tasmanian Forest Agreementâ€”which I'm proud to say my colleague Nick McKim played a role in deliveringâ€”have gone towards setting up mountain bike paths that are now leading the charge in the diversification of the Tasmanian economy. That is another win for the Greens, and for the Tasmanian people. In fact, I could go on and on all day about our 20-year vision for the Tasmanian economy that's come to pass. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1992, previous senator Christine Milne and the Green Independents put together a policy for Tasmania. This did include a policy for small business, because they knew back then that small business was the backbone of the Tasmanian economy. They knew that the big businesses that were tied to global commodity cycles would, unfortunately, likely fail in a changing world of globalisation. They predicted the demise of price-taking industries that had no control over their future, and they were right. They said governments should be investing in small business, incentivising small business, and focusing on the competitive strengths of Tasmaniaâ€”what we have that is unique, that the rest of the world wants and will come and see and will pay good money to see. And we were right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only thing that's held Tasmania back for decadesâ€”it's benefiting from this nowâ€”is the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and their anti-Greens rhetoric and the action they have taken to do everything they possibly can to put us out of business. But I say to Senator Seselja that we were right about small business and the importance of small business in Tasmania. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bushby, I urge you to support this amendment of Senator McKim's, because you know how important small business is to Tasmania. You have small business interests in your family. You know both my wife and I have run small businesses in Tasmania, and we're just like the tens of thousands of Tasmanians that have small businesses. They work really hard; they employ the majority of Tasmanians. This is exactly the kind of amendment that you should support, to support Tasmanians.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BUSHBY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:48</span>):  A few points that were made by the previous two contributors to this debate need some comment. Senator Whish-Wilson was just talking about the so-called windfall to the hydro-electric corporation in Tasmania as a result of the so-called carbon tax that was introduced by the previous Labor government. There is no doubt that they did have an opportunity to make extra money at that time. But that money didn't come from nowhere; that money was coming because they were able to charge higher energy prices to Tasmaniansâ€”to Tasmanian households and to Tasmanian businessesâ€”because, as part of the National Electricity Market, the carbon tax had increased the national price of energy and therefore they were able to charge more for their energy. That meant that Tasmanian households and Tasmanian businesses were paying higher energy costs and that Hydro, because it's renewable and was not having to contribute the same degree of cost through the carbon tax, was making a windfall. But make no mistake: that windfall was coming at the expense of Tasmanians and Tasmanian businessesâ€”Tasmanian small businesses, which Senator Whish-Wilson is saying this amendment will assist. I think there was also a mention of mountain bike paths as one of the magnificent things that were delivered by the previous Tasmanian state Labor-Green government. Most of the mountain bike paths that exist in Tasmaniaâ€”that have been builtâ€”have been funded in large part by the federal Liberal government since 2013. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that, by most economic metrics, prior to March 2014 Tasmania was languishing at the bottom of the pack relative to other states. We were seen as the poor cousin right across the nation, no matter which metric you looked at. That turned around after March 2014. There was an immediate improvement in business confidence just because of the election of the majority Hodgman Liberal government. There was an immediate improvement in confidence that resulted in an immediate increase in business and other investment, which led to Tasmania now being around the middle or higher in those same economic metrics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's not pretend and try to rewrite history that the Labor-Green state government was somehow a miraculous government that just happened to miss out on all the good things showing up because it lost the March 2014 election but all the good things that they did came out afterwards. The reality is that it was the election of the majority Hodgman Liberal government that provided confidence for businesses in Tasmania to make the investments.</span>

The problem that we face is that neither the LNP nor Labor are going to vote for the amendment that's currently before the Senate. Remember, this amendment would incentivise small business to invest in energy efficiency and to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That position is not surprising, given the massive donations that both the LNP and the ALP get from the fossil fuel sectorâ€”tens of millions of dollars a year straight into their parties' coffers so they can run campaigns to get re-elected. Of course, those donations buy the fossil fuel industry policy outcomes, and we're seeing that play out on the floor of the Senate this morning.</span>

Every single LNP and Liberal senator is about to vote against that and vote against small business in Tasmania. The same applies for every single ALP senator from Tasmania. They're about to vote against every small business in Tasmania being able to receive a more favourable tax treatment for assets they invest in, up to a threshold of $30,000, which would allow them to invest in energy efficiency, to reduce their use of fossil fuels and to fuel switch from gas to electricity.</span>

We're in a situation where the new Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, is washing his hands of responsibility to act on the disruption of our climate; to bring Australia's emissions profile down; to show global leadership and show other countries that as a rich, developed nation we can step up and fulfil our moral obligations to the rest of the world.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you, Chair. I've seen reports that one of Minister Payne's speeches to that forum did not mention climate change. Pacific island nations have shown global leadership on this issue, because some of them are going to disappear this century, Minister. It's not good enough for you and your government not to take the issue of emissions reduction seriously. Australia should be a global leader in showing the way forward on this issue. It is a disgrace that we have a Prime Minister who basically said this week that Australians are not interested in climate change. He's wrong. The polls show he's wrong. It's part of the reason why he's going to be ignominiously turfed out of government next year, along with Minister Payne and all his colleagues. He is misreading the mood of the nation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want strong action on climate change. They want far stronger action than even the Australian Labor Party are proposing on climate change. In fact, it is the Greens who are proposing setting a pollution standard for power stations and progressively shutting them, starting with the worst first. It is only the Greens in this place who oppose the Adani coalmine. The Queensland Labor government wanted to give free coal, free water and free money to one of the most corrupt corporations in the world, the Adani Group. That's exactly what they were doing.

                    </a>  Thank you, Chair. I appreciate your drawing the amendment to my attention. In continuing my contribution, I would draw the committee's attention to the fact that our amendment is actually all about reducing emissions, at least in part, as well as helping the bottom line of small business. Senator Cameron wrote the book on digressing from the topic at hand in this Senate, in my experience, so I'm very happy to take his counsel on that!</span>

It would give the opportunity for every small business in this country to thrive and prosper to a greater degree than will be the case when this amendment fails.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  Well, we finally made it! The Senate can finally consider the government's Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding for Proprietary Companies) Bill 2017. It's been nearly four years in the making, but the government has finally put forward some legislation that might meaningfully give effect to equity crowdfunding in Australia. The problem is that the government have been so diverted by the muppets across the chamber, so diverted by the extremists in their own party, that they really can't get on and deal with the issues that are important to the Australian economy and to the Australian people. Taking four years to get a bill to the Senate floor on crowdfunding just demonstrates how incapable this government is of actually focusing on the real issues of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill removes a range of government imposed regulatory blocks stopping proprietary companies, especially start-ups and small businesses, from using crowdsourced equity funding. By way of brief explanation, equity crowdfunding uses the internet to harness the financial support of investors to back a business, and in return those investors get a stake in that business. I open by referencing the tortuous journey this reform has been forced to experience under the coalition. It is worth recalling some history. In government, Labor tasked the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee to start scoping out a framework for equity crowdfunding in May 2013. A full year later in May 2014, following the change of government, CAMAC handed its report to the new coalition government, and all action subsequently stalled due to endless rounds of further consultation throughout 2014-15 and endless self-recrimination within the Liberal Party, which is stuck in an absolutely chaotic positionâ€”a government that has been incapable of governing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile various reports continued to identify the potential of equity crowdfunding to improve access to finance for small to medium enterprises: for example, the government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Industry</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">innovation</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">competitiveness</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">agenda</span> report, released in October 2014; the final report of the Murray inquiry into Australia's financial system, released in December 2014; the <span style="font-style:italic;">Business</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">set-up,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">transfer</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">closure</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Productivity</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Commission</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">draft</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">report</span>, released in May 2015; the government's National Innovation and Science Agenda, released in December 2015; and the government's own fin-tech statement, released in March 2016â€”more reports, more analysis, less action. That has been this government through and through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government eventually introduced its bill in 2015, but it was roundly criticised for being too cumbersome for the sector. After ultimately withdrawing that bill, those opposite introduced a new version in 2016 with roughly similar flaws. This is our government: you point out the problems; it looks at the bill and brings it back with the same problems still in itâ€”totally incompetent. No wonder the Prime Minister describes his own party as the muppets!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally in March last year the government used its numbers to force the bill through and sign into law an equity crowdfunding framework that it knew full well would have to be fixed before the year was out. The reality was that the current framework was racing towards one milestone and one milestone only: extinction. Sure enough, here we are in 2018 considering yet another attempt by this dysfunctional government, a government of muppets, to fix mistakes of its own making. The title of this bill is worth noting. It is the Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding for Proprietary Companies) Billâ€”2017! The bill has been stuck in parliament for a year because the government couldn't be bothered bringing on debate and getting this bill moving. Not only that; those opposite have had their own internal little problems in the meantime, carving each other up, knifing each other, changing the Prime Ministerâ€”complete dysfunction, complete chaos. This country needs a government that can focus on the issues that are important for the Australian people, and it is not the muppets sitting across the chamber. It is taking a new Treasurer to make it happen. The incompetence of this government is extraordinary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the other place the former Treasurer, now Prime Minister, lamely attempted to paper over this by suggesting his hand had been forced by shareholders to bring in new changes to its flawed equity crowdfunding framework. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a surprise. This is not a new revelation. Stakeholders have said this for years.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government get up here and lecture everyone on how they know about business, how they can really push business along in this country and, at the same time, they can't even get the basics right in a very simple bill. They are a bunch of frauds. They are a bunch of muppets. Even their own Prime Minister has got the adjective right about themâ€”absolute muppets; economic incompetents and absolute political incompetents.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The assessment by the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law was made years ago, but it remained the biggest criticism that confronted the government's botched reforms in this area. It is worth remembering that, even last year, speaking in response to the government's 2017 bill, business was critical of the government's efforts, with tech firm Veromo's Andy Giles stating: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So businesses are saying that the proposition from this government, who claim that they are the government of business, was 'unthinkable'. What a bunch of amateurs on the other side! </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not embarrassed by criticism that they were continually dragging their feet on this reform over the last four years, the government introduced this bill here in September last year and we debated it 12 months later. Now the government have come up with a bill to plug the gaps they left in March last year. The opposition is largely supportive of the bill. It provides some new allowances in its current form. For example, it permits that investors who acquire shares through crowdfunding offers not be counted towards the shareholder cap currently applied to proprietary companies. The bill exempts proprietary companies with shareholders who acquire shares through a crowdfunding offer from the takeover rules in chapter 6 of the Corporations Act. To provide some safeguard to investors, the bill also contains a regulation-making power. This will give the government the capability to respond quickly by imposing additional conditions on this exemption, if required. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question remains: is 'quickly' something the government are capable of doing? Well, in some things, the answer is yes. They can quickly get rid of a Prime Minister. They can stab a Prime Minister in the back. They can demolish their own credibility very quickly. They can do all of those things. They can quickly turn on each other. The Liberal Party can turn on the National Party. The National Party can turn on the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party can turn on each other. They can do that very quickly, but can they do anything that supports progress in this country? Not really. They talk a big game and they do nothing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also intends to impose additional obligations on companies who opt in to the equity crowdfunding regime. For example, proprietary companies with crowdfunding shareholders will be required to provide additional reporting to ASIC, provide information on the company register, prepare financial reports and statements for audit when over $3 million has been raised through crowdfunding offers, and have a minimum of two directors to assist with succession planning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, while we largely support this bill we are mindful of the start-up community's criticisms concerning the further delays baked into the bill by this incompetent government. Notably, the government's current bill would force businesses to wait yet another six months after royal assent before they could access this regime. In our consultations with the sector they called for this delay to be significantly reduced, which is why we pushed for this on behalf of small business and innovative enterprises forced to wait for the new regime. Given the bulk of the regulatory changes that have been put in place, and the extraordinary length of time people have been made aware of the likely arrival of equity crowdfunding, we believe that one month after royal assent is long enough for the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To their creditâ€”and I don't give them much credit; they don't give themselves much credit, so let's give them a little bit of creditâ€”the government has taken on board the opposition's concerns and has indicated its willingness to scale back the wait time to one month. While we would have preferred no delay back in May, as the fin-tech sector called for, we recognise this does present challenges for the responsible regulators, so we accept the need to amend the start date accordingly. Having said that, just imagine if the government had scheduled this debate sooner. We may well have had the new regime start earlier. I commend our amendment to the Senate and urge the crossbench to support our commonsense proposition. </span>

This is a bill that the opposition actually supports, and he was miserable giving his not quite 20 minutes to the chamber today on the Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding for Proprietary Companies) Bill 2017. This is a man who, quite clearly, didn't understand the content of the bill. He peppered it with bile, spewing forth throughout, reading the contents of his speech today in the chamber. Quite clearly, Senator Cameron is a man who has invested in nothing in his life. He has taken no risks in investment in his life other than, potentially, investing in whatever might give him a comfortable retirement. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to touch on four areas today: why I support this bill very enthusiastically; the specific provisions of the legislation and what the bill, in fact, does; the broader contribution of crowdfunding, generally, to Australia's economic prosperity; and how this builds on the work that the coalition is doing to support small businesses and start-ups in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would the government support this particular bill? In Australia we are not simply a nation of dreamers, we are a nation of doers. To provide my colleagues with some context to this: in June 2016 there were 2.2 million businesses trading across Australia. The number of new start-ups in the year prior to that was up 1.2 per cent. Indeed, the coalition's innovation agenda ushered in the promise of easy access for start-ups to crowdsourced equity funding, funding for incubator support programs, and tax incentives for investors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Morrison has said that those in this country willing to have a go should get a go, and that is fairness. He has been very clear that this bill forms part of the coalition's determination to deliver on that promise. This is in step with many other advanced economies that have embraced crowdsourced equity funding in support of business growth, from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which provides compelling and renowned alternatives for funding business development, to Singapore, which has recently made similar changes of its own to ensure a more streamlined and simplified framework for businesses to start up and to invest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the legislation that we are discussing today is very much some of the metal behind that vision that the government has set out in that initial work on the innovation agenda. While the title of this bill doesn't sound particularly exciting, it will have an impact on thousands of businesses and individuals who aspire to bring ideas to the market. They will have more access to money to do so and will have their chance to have a go and make their dreams come true. That is truly exciting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's why good government matters. It's about making the changes that genuinely, really count, rather than just whining and complaining all the time and finding something to be miserable about. Extending that good framework for crowdsourced funding is a key example of the former. I honestly think that Senator Cameron has spent way too much time in opposition. I think five years of opposition is beginning to take its toll. He has nothing good to say anymore, even about a genuinely good piece of legislation. Crowdsourced funding enables start-ups and small to medium sized businesses to raise money from the public to finance their businesses. These can be very small amounts from a broad range of investors. There may be quite a large number of investors. Companies that have less than $25 million in assets and annual revenue can raise up to $5 million a year using crowdsourced funding. When I became a senator, I stood in this chamber and said that in 20 years I wanted to be able to look my children in the eye and assure them that my generation did all that it could to create a prosperous and productive Australia. If we get this right, those born after 1992, currently aged 26 and under, not only will lead the entrepreneurial charge but will now be equipped to do so. Legislation like this will help ensure that future generations lead the charge for growth and business development in this country, the like of which we have never known.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk very briefly about what this bill actually does. Under the existing law, companies must use a crowdsourced funding, or CSF, platform, usually online, to make their investment offer. This is run by an intermediary that must have an Australian financial services licence authorising them to provide crowdsourced funding services. The intermediary acts as a gatekeeper between the company and investors and checks the company and the investment information that the company provides before the offer is placed on the website. For example, the crowdsourced funding website must have a warning for investors about the risks of investing through crowdsourced funding, as well as copies of the offer documents for each investment, which have important information about the business making the offer. The website must also have an online portal that potential investors can use to ask the company and the intermediary questions about the investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we're discussing in the chamber today makes an essential legislative amendment to the Corporations Act by extending the legislative framework for crowdsourced equity funding beyond public companies to proprietary companies as well. It builds on an already established crowdsourced funding equity framework for public companies which commences at the end of this month.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'What is crowdsourced funding?' I hear you ask, Acting Deputy President. Crowd-sourced equity funding is a relatively new and innovative concept. It enables businesses to source capital from a very broad range of investors online. Typically, each investor will contribute a small amount of money in return for an equity stake in the business. The coalition consulted at length on this extension of the policy to proprietary companies, and the submissions received as part of this consultation expressed widespread support for extending the crowdsourced equity funding model and framework to proprietary companies. Extending the framework to proprietary companies builds on the existing framework for public companies and, as such, will incorporate many of those existing features of the public company framework that I mentioned earlier, such as the obligations for intermediaries and the process of making crowdsourced funding offers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, private companies or proprietary companies are limited to 50 non-employee shareholders, so, to ensure that proprietary companies can effectively access the framework without breaching that cap of 50 non-employee shareholders for proprietary companies, investors who acquire shares through crowdfunding offers will not be counted in that shareholder cap. Subsequent transfers by crowdfunding investors who onsell their shares will also be exempt if the company is not listed on the financial market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crowdfunding priority companies will be exempt from takeover provisions, also consistent with the light-touch regulatory approach of the equity crowdfunding regime. The takeover rules are in fact very complex and would be very, very costly for proprietary companies using crowdsourced funding to understand and comply with. Recognising that this is in fact an extension is a new approach to the proprietary company framework in Australia. These companies will face some additional obligations, such as a minimum of two directors, financial reporting in accordance with reporting standards, and restrictions on related party transactions. This demonstrates the robust nature of the safeguards contained in the legislation before the chamber today while still embracing new start-up and business ventures and allowing them to grow, to expand and, hopefully, to thrive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, it is important to know that proprietary companies that raise $3 million or more will also be required to maintain audited financial statements. To ensure consistency with the proprietary company framework, the bill also increases the audit threshold for eligible public companies from $1 million to $3 million. Finally, the bill removes the temporary new public company concessions in the Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding) Act 2017. These concessions will be grandfathered for companies that register with a public company status prior to the bill taking effect after royal assent. These changes will not blur the lines between public and proprietary companies. It is perhaps worth noting that 98 per cent of Australian registered companies are in fact proprietary companies, and start-ups in particular adopt this structure. An inflexible approach would result in a much higher regulatory burden that deters business growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to touch on the contribution of crowdsourced funding to the economy. I've already outlined the specific impact of this legislation and the changes in detail. As mentioned, crowdsourced funding enables start-ups and small to medium-sized businesses to raise money directly from the public to finance their businesses and can be sourced from a variety of investors. We're seeing significant good-news stories already in Australia as a result of crowdsourced funding techniques. Indeed, since the equity crowdfunding framework was originally passed, in March last year, Australia has seen its first crowdsource-funded power retail company launched, a company called DC Power Co. It's hoped that this particular company will tap into almost two million solar households, and potentially six million by the year 2050. This solar energy disruptor has claimed a world record for the most people ever around the world participating in a crowdfunded equity raising, with over 17,625 retail investors taking part. It's a brilliant example of the contribution crowdsourced funding can make to Australia's economic prosperity. This particular company intends to seek investment from up to 95,000 people in order to raise a total of $4.75 million. So it's not the future of raising capital; in fact we're already facing the reality of how capital is raised, and this is what this bill specifically acknowledges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the bigger picture, crowdfunding offers a foundation for start-ups that automatically creates more job opportunities, which are of course essential to a growing economy. Moreover, generating a buzz around a forthcoming product or service often leads to more sales and more revenue generated. So crowdsourced funding can be a marketing tool as well as an equity-raising tool. The coalition thinks this is a good thing, and the coalition is delivering on legislation to make it possible. Business thinks this is a good thing. Entrepreneurs think this is a good thing. Innovators think this is a good thing. So the coalition thinks this is a good thing too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other ways small businesses and start-ups are being supported by the coalition. Let me turn now to talk about some of those other ways in which small businesses are being supported. The government's support of small businesses and start-ups does not start and end with crowdsourced funding; although it does make it easier, it's only one part of the puzzle. There are a range of initiatives already in place that make entrepreneurship and small business easier in Australia. Let me talk first about the Entrepreneurs' Program, which helps businesses increase productivity and competitiveness, linking them with funds and access to a national network of private sector advisers and facilitators across Australia. This is the government's flagship initiative for business competitiveness and productivity. It provides a range of grants, offering ventures up to 50 per cent of expenditure on a particular project, and applicants can seek free expert advice on ventures to address their knowledge gaps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another initiative is the CSIRO Kick-Start program, which is driving innovation by supporting local start-ups. It focuses on the research and testing of companies that have a new idea, a novel product or a service. It gives small to medium enterprises that are in the start-up phase access to the CSIRO's research expertise and capabilities and helps them grow and develop their businesses. Eligible companies have to be registered in Australia for GST, have an annual turnover of $1.5 million or less in the current and past two financial years and have been registered as a company for fewer than three years. They receive dollar-matched funding to research, develop or test a product or a process with commercial potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one of my personal favourites is the Biomedical Translation Fund, which supports start-ups operating in the area of health and wellbeing. It was established originally as part of the coalition's National Innovation and Science Agenda, and it's armed with over $250 million of Commonwealth capital and an additional $250 million from private sector capital. So far, ten investments have been made through the Biomedical Translation Fund, the BTF, including $7.5 million in a start-up company called Global Kinetics in April this year. Global Kinetics is an extraordinary company. It creates watches that measure movements, whether they be tremors, dyskinesia or other movement disorder symptoms. They collect data on the frequency and severity of those movements, which can change the lives of patients with Parkinson's disease.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the R&amp;D tax incentive to help all businesses stay ahead of the curve through a tax offset and encourage innovation, even in the smallest of ventures. From 1 July 2016, companies with an annual turnover of under $20 million can claim a 43.5 per cent refundable tax offset against R&amp;D expenditure that amounts to $100 million or less. All other eligible companies can claim a 38.5 per cent non-refundable tax offset. For R&amp;D expenditure under $20,000, companies can only make a claim if it was undertaken with a research service provider or a cooperative centre.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other programs run by the government that can provide incentives, whether they be financial or otherwise, to help young companies get off the ground, like the Venture Capital Limited Partnerships program in Australia, which attracts foreign investors to Australia and boosts the local venture capital market with tax benefits. To be eligible for that, funds must register as a venture capital partnership under the Venture Capital Act 2002 and make commercial, non-property, non-construction or non-infrastructure investments and hold them for at least 12 months. Those investments must be in ventures where the total assets are valued at under $250 million, 50 per cent of the assets are located in Australia and at least 50 per cent of the employees are in Australia. Tax benefits for VCLPs include flowthrough taxation treatment, exemption from capital gains tax on the share of profits made by the partnership and the ability to claim carried interest on the capital account instead of revenue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another program is the Austrade Landing Pads initiative, which aims to give Australian start-ups a leg-up in the global market by immersing them in one of five world-class innovation hubs. Start-ups accepted into Landing Pads in Singapore, Berlin, Shanghai, Tel Aviv or San Francisco benefit from an on-the-ground presence plus access to networks, talent, mentors and investors. To be eligible, start-ups must demonstrate a strong vision, scalability, traction and differentiation and explain how 90 days in a landing pad in one of those five markets could help their venture. Austrade provides workspace, an accelerator and free services, but participants have to fund their own travel, accommodation, living costs, visas, insurance et cetera. Austrade may also provide funding, potentially, for global start-ups in Australia through Export Market Development Grants.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without doubt, the Morrison coalition government is doing significant work to put small business and start-up development at the core of its innovation agenda. It requires constant work. It's not something about which any government could afford to be complacent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As credit becomes tighter, it impacts the viability of some businesses. So it is importantâ€”it is absolutely criticalâ€”that we, as a government, are constantly looking for better ways to help incentivise development and embrace the future, and crowdsourced funding goes such a long way towards that. It's not the only solution, and I think I've made that clear today. There are other ways to help and encourage young businesses, start-ups, small to medium enterprises, people with a good idea and people with a dream. How do we help them get a chance, get their first foot in the door, get a leg-up? How do we help their businesses grow and thrive and survive? Crowdsourced funding is part of the puzzle.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding for Proprietary Companies) Bill strives to balance supporting investment, reducing compliance costs and maintaining appropriate investor protections for proprietary companies as well as for public companies. I believe, and the coalition believes, that this legislation will go a long way to ensuring that Australia embraces crowdsourced fundingâ€”the concept of crowdsourced funding, and the opportunities that come with itâ€”as a viable route by which small businesses and start-ups can establish themselves, grow, expand, flourish and, hopefully, employ more Australians, because, when it comes down to it, that's what it's all about. That's why we want businesses to grow. That's why jobs and growth are so important to the coalition. Jobs aren't ends in themselves; they're a means to allow society to grow and to flourish, to survive and to thrive.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I rise to speak about the Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding for Proprietary Companies) Bill 2017. After listening to the speeches in the chamber today, I can't wait to get out of here and go and sign up to some of these amazing crowdsourced equity projects. It's going to build the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's be very clear: what we're talking about here is risk capitalâ€”in fact, some of the highest risk capital that we can see being raised through a retail offer. I've raised concerns about this in the pastâ€”in fact, this morning, going into this debate, I read my previous speechâ€”and I have looked closely at the bill, and I will say that some of the concerns I have raised previously have been addressed in this bill. But we're talking about risk capital here. We're talking about entrepreneurs raising moneyâ€”to the $10,000 limitâ€”from an unlimited number of Australians, up to their subscription level. Ten thousand dollars might not be a lot to people in this chamber, or to some people in this chamber, but it is a lot of money to an individual Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, my experience, from having worked in equities markets both here and overseas, is: I've seen the best and the worst. I've seen the kind of unscrupulous behaviour that leads to severe hardship and loss of money. I campaigned, and my party campaigned, for four years to get a royal commission into misconduct in the banking and financial services sector. That's happening now, and we've seen a whole range of examples raised of how things can go wrongâ€”and they're not necessarily even in high-risk products; quite often they're in things like superannuation and insurance. But what we're dealing with here is the highest risk spectrum of fundraising for retail investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past, before crowdsourcing became a thing in recent years, entrepreneurs who had a risky project at a very early stage of developmentâ€”which, by definition, often makes it riskyâ€”would go to angel investors. Angel investors are highly sophisticated investors. They understand risk. They understand that the majority of these projects will never be commercialised. They will never be commercialised. Some of them aren't designed to be commercialised, I agree with that. In my first speech on this bill, I gave the example of a honey-making technology in Byron Bayâ€”a friend of mine was involved in that. That was designed to create a backyard honey-making operation. It wasn't really designed to make a lot of money, but it's been quite a successful crowdsourcing venture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen what happens when you let sharks into the pool. There's plenty of burley being thrown in the water here with this legislation, let me tell you. I've seen, in particular, the high-risk end of the equities market. I've seen unscrupulous company directors mining shareholders for many years, continually raising equity capital on the promise that they were going to deliver high returnsâ€”blue-sky mining at its best. I'm concerned that the same kind of people that continually make a living out of being shystersâ€”and it astounds me how they keep coming backâ€”will look at this structure before us and will say: 'Yes, I'm going to participate in this. I don't need to have my accounts audited until they're at $3 million.' There is a list of things they'll have to comply with, but at the end of the day we are talking about blue-sky projects; we are talking about things at the early stages of development, which, who knows, may or may not get up. If an investor understands the riskâ€”an investor is diversified, and they're happy to put $10,000 into a project that they either support on a personal or a philosophical level, or they don't mind losing $10,000 if it doesn't get upâ€”that's fine. If they put in the $10,000 and they understand they may lose it but also that they might potentially get a very high return in the future, that's also fine. But, once again, whether it was the FOFA laws that we debated in here years ago, or the long and winding road to a royal commission, we can't make the assumption that investors will get that asymmetric information and a whole range of other things we looked at in detail in committees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a few questions, if I get to be around when we go in committee, Acting Deputy President Bernardi, but I may be sitting in your chair, so it may not happen. So I would like to put on record the things I don't believe have been addressed in this bill. I'm still very concerned about secondary markets for these, let's call them, parcels or investment units in crowdsourced funding operations or companies. Whether it's a public company or a proprietary company, what is the secondary market? Is there one for these investments? We know that there's an appointed intermediary who has to have a licence and that they are going to be regulated by ASIC, but, once again, I ask people to look at the landscape here. We're getting a lot of revelations from the royal commission about how difficult it is for our regulators to get on top of these issues, even in big, well-respected blue-chip corporations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, we are dealing with extremely high risk equity capital hereâ€”the highest risk financing that I can see in the spectrum. So, putting aside any doubts I might have about whether ASIC have the resources and the powers to do their job properly in relation to these kinds of things and whether they will, I'm still very concerned that one of the key indicators of risk in any investment is liquidity. How will I get out of my investment if I choose to? Who will price that? Am I locked in, in perpetuity? What is the exit strategy for an investor in these businesses? Is it that, because they're investing in something, they can receive a unit of it, like the physical delivery of a product in the case of the honey-making product that my friend in Byron Bay was involved in? People invested their money so that they could actually get a unit of it. It was like a down payment on getting it once it was produced. Is it an investment to purely make a capital return? If so, how do I trade out of my shares, my units in these investment companies? If the company goes publicâ€”and, I think, in a diversified portfolio of high-risk angel investors, you might expect one in 20 or 30 companies to be successful. If my company were successful and it went on to become, for example, a listed company on the stock market because the technology had taken off, who prices the original unit holders? How is that process enacted? Do unit holders get access to an IPO? What happens if the company that has been set up through CSF decides that it wants to sell the company or sell the asset? I understand there are restrictions here on takeovers, but what if the company voluntarily decides to sell its technology to a third party, which quite often happens? Who prices the exit strategy for those CSF investors in that business?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very immature market. As Senator Hume outlined, we really are at the beginning of a bountiful period, where these kinds of vehicles are going to facilitate entrepreneurial flair and develop the industries of the future. If that's the case, then I would say today that we need to watch this very closely. While the intentions of a lot of people in the fin-tech industry who are trying to do the right thing may be very good, it will attract sharks. Unfortunately, that's a sad fact of life. So how do we actually manage these risks? Is there going to be a secondary market? Do the financial intermediariesâ€”the licence holdersâ€”provide any advice to investors? Will they be doing any research? They're handling the transactions. Having been a broker myself, it's very hard to handle transactions, if there is any kind of secondary market, without providing advice. And will that also be regulated under the Corporations Act and by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission? We're dealing with high-risk capital here and with the potential for investors to be ripped off. I'm sure there's potential for investors to be happy and to realise long-term returns but, given how immature this market is, I certainly would like to see answers to these questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, I hope that I'll get a chance to ask some of these questions in committee and I will say that the Greens will be supporting this bill primarily because issues like the audit limit are subject to review. There is flexibility built into the legislation to allow these things to be changed as we fine-tune this and watch it very closely, but I do want some confidence in liquidity and the risk that poses to future investors.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HZE" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I'd like to thank all those senators who have contributed to this debate. This bill gives effect to the government's commitment to extend crowdsourced equity funding to proprietary companies in Australia. Extending the crowdfunding framework to proprietary companies will allow these companies to access an alternative form of finance, with additional obligations in place to protect investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alternative forms of finance are particularly important for innovative, early-stage businesses that may have difficulty accessing funding from traditional sources. As part of this bill, proprietary companies wanting to access equity crowdfunding will no longer have to convert to public company type, with its more onerous obligations. Instead, founders will be able to crowdfund while retaining the greater flexibility of the proprietary model. This extension will enable proprietary companies to access the existing regime that passed the parliament in March 2017. Providing one framework for both public and proprietary companies will reduce complexity, as proprietary companies will use the existing offer document processes and licensing regime for crowdsourced equity funding intermediaries. Investors in crowdfunding proprietary companies will benefit from the intermediary obligations and minimum requirements of the offer document, as set out in the existing crowdfunding framework.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crowdfunding proprietary companies will be exempt from the takeover provisions that usually apply once a company has more than 50 shareholders. The government listened to stakeholder feedback that the draft legislation's proposed exit arrangements would hamper legitimate capital raising. However, as it is common for proprietary companies to have tag rights in their constitutions, which allow smaller shareholders to participate in a buyout, the government proposes to include in regulations a requirement for companies to disclose these rights in the crowdfunding offer document.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising that proprietary companies generally have lower reporting and governance obligations than public companies, investors in proprietary companies will benefit from appropriate additional protections. These include a minimum of two directors, financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting standards, and auditing of financial statements once a proprietary company has raised at least $3 million through crowdsourced equity funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crowdfunding proprietary companies will also be subject to the related party transaction rules under part 2E of the Corporations Act 2001. These additional company obligations will promote investor confidence in the market by ensuring that companies have a minimum level of transparency with their crowd investors. Transparency of the online market enabled by technology also gives shareholders greater power. Confidence in the market will ensure the sustainability of the equity crowdfunding regime. This will help maintain a diversity of funding options that small businesses need in order to succeed. The government has consulted at length on the extension of this policy to proprietary companies to seek an appropriate balance on the trade-off between the corporate governance and transparency measures that are necessary to protect retail investors and the cost of compliance for small innovative companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Submissions expressed widespread support for the extension of the crowdsourced equity funding framework to proprietary companies, although they have diverse views on the detailed design elements. The government has closely listened to this feedback and considers that the bill strikes the right balance between the need for transparency and good corporate governance and the costs of compliance. The extension of the crowdsourced equity funding framework in this bill will take effect six months after it receives royal assent, although I note the amendment from the opposition, which the government will be supporting and which will see the bill take effect earlier than was initially anticipated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Securities and Investments Commission received $4.5 million in the 2017-18 budget to implement and monitor the extension of the equity crowdfunding framework. This bill's introduction will enable proprietary companies to obtain the capital they need to turn good ideas into commercial successes while providing Australian investors with a larger pool of choice. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

Obviously, by their nature, investments in small unlisted companies, including CSF companies, will be illiquid. All CSF offers must include a risk warning that discloses to investors the risk that their investment will be illiquid. However, the bill includes provisions to allow CSF shareholders to transfer their shares to other people without counting towards the 50-shareholder cap that exists for proprietary companies if that transfer occurs before the company is listed on a financial market. This provides some flexibility for CSF shareholders who may wish to exit their investment. If over time a secondary market for CSF shares develops, the operator of that market will need to obtain an Australian market licence and comply with relevant consumer protection requirements.</span>

You said there's been some development of these kinds of markets overseas. Have any existing financial licence holders in Australia shown interest in registering for this? Does it have to be a separate registration? For example, can an existing stockbroking equities company now take on a role of buying and selling share parcels in these CSF companies? Have they expressed any interest in it? How will that be regulated?</span>

I have to come up with a value for issuing those CSF parcels to individual investors. How do we look at the interaction between how I value my own shares, because I set it up, and other shares? Is it preliminary to the CSF stage of development? When it gets to the next stageâ€”if it ever gets to the next stageâ€”where it is commercialised and monetised through the share market or for a sale, what requirements will there be to make sure that initial investors get looked after and get an adequate return?

An exemption from the takeover provisions is consistent with a light-touch regulatory approach to the CSF regime. The takeover rules are very complex and would be difficult and costly for proprietary companies to understand and comply with. While there will be no legislative provisions on takeovers, it is common for proprietary companies to have tag rights in their constitutions which allow smaller shareholders to participate in a buyout. Proposed revisions to regulations for the CSF regime will ensure that the existence or not of these rights is disclosed in the CSF offer document. In terms of sale of assets, related party rules would apply.</span>

The Commonwealth is the consent authority for major developments at airports, which is unusual for infrastructure projects. Nineteen of the 21 federally leased airports are required to submit a master plan every five years for approval by the minister. Each master plan sets out strategic development over a 20-year period. The master plan process requires community consultation. Specific major projects require federal approval or a separate major development plan.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its original form, the bill made the following changes: all airports will be required to submit master plans, which will be removed from a five-year cycle to an eight-year cycle; an updated Australian noise exposure forecast will be required for each of the master plans; there will be a money trigger for the separate major development plans that will arise; there will be 15 days for the minister to consider reduced consultation periods for the major plans with deemed approval if that time frame is not met; there will be a proposal to enable the minister to extend, more than once, the period during which major developments are required to be substantially completed; and, finally, airport operators will be allowed to notify the minister of exceptional circumstances that mean a major development cannot proceed. The government claimed that these changes removed inefficient outcomes and onerous administrative burdens for the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is being debated at a time of considerable development at our nation's major airports. It also occurs at a time of considerable growth in air transport. Over the past 20 years, international passenger movement has grown at an annual average rate of some 4.5 per cent. That is slightly above the GDP growth in aviation. Labor has made it very clear that we support broad consultation with local communities, proper assessments of community impacts and reasonable mitigation measures to reduce those impacts when it comes to the question of airport development. We've had some concerns about the original form of this bill, but the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Mr McCormack, was prepared to work with the shadow minister to resolve these issues in a bipartisan manner and make this a better bill. Firstly, as the bill originally proposed increasing the monetary trigger for requiring the development of a major development plan from $20 million to $35 million, the government agreed to a lower trigger of $25 million. This figure, in our judgement, more accurately reflects the recent increases in construction costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the initial bill introduced into the House proposed inserting a new subsection that would have provided that, if an airport makes a request for a shorter consultation period for a major development plan and the minister doesn't make a decision on the request within 15 business days, the minister is deemed to have approved that shorter period. Labor could not have supported such an amendment. Of course, the amendment undermined the right of local communities to actually have a say. In the words of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bills</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span>, which were prepared by the Parliamentary Library:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment seems to raise the possibility that the Minister could simply not decide on the request, and then be deemed to have approved the short period, even if the development is inconsistent with the airport master plan, or raises issues that have a significant impact on the local or regional community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be well within a minister's capability to consider any request for reduced consultation within 15 business days, and that's why we welcome the government's decision to accept Labor's amendment which will deem any request for a shorter consultation period not approved by the minister within the 15 business days as being refused. This will achieve the right balance. And if we don't get the balance right in these tragic circumstances, I think it is of great disadvantage to local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we saw the situation that occurred in my localityâ€”I'll make this point. I've actually lived underneath a flight path with regard to Essendon Airport. I no longer live under a flight path, I'm pleased to say, but I do still live in Pascoe Vale in Melbourne, a few minutes from Essendon Airport. The circumstances that arose with regard to the events in February 2017, where a Beechcraft Super King Air B200 crashed into the DFO shopping centre in Essendon, has stuck quite dramatically in the minds of the local community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The circumstances of this incident, I acknowledge, are still under investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. But I am reminded that that shopping centre is within, I think, 170 metres of the runway. It is an extraordinary thing to actually visit that shopping centre and see just how close it is to the runway at Essendon. This crash was described at the time as 'Victoria's worst civil aviation accident in 30 years,' and it caused concern for residents and businesses surrounding the airport. I make the point that not only is that runway very close to the DFO but it's also very close to the freeways that run parallel to the airport and cut across the flight path of that runway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having received an overwhelming volume of calls and correspondence from local constituents, Mr Khalil, the federal member in the seat of Wills, and Mr Shorten, the federal member adjacent to the airport in the seat of Maribyrnong, hosted, in December 2017, a community forum at Strathmore Heights Community Hall, which is just around the corner from where I live. Hundreds of local residents attended, as well as representatives of the Victorian government and considerable media. It reflected the concerns of residents. The points that were raised by Mr Khalil and Mr Shorten had been presented in a letter to Mr Chester in October 2017, saying that until the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has published its findings about the fatal crash that occurred on 21 February 2017 questions remain unanswered about the safety of the airport, especially given the proximity of commercial and residential developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This tragic event at Essendon and incidents at other airports like Moorabbin highlight the need to get the planning balance rightâ€”that is, the balance between community safety and airport operations. I've long held the view that it's not unreasonable to suggest that the primary purpose of airports is aviation, not retail. I think the balance has been lost in the planning decisions that have been taken at a number of airports around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the observation that Labor has had a look at the second reading amendment to this legislation proposed by the Greens. We won't be supporting that amendment, but we do readily acknowledge the concerns of community groups and individuals who are affected by airport noise. We acknowledge that policymakers and agencies that oversee these issues have to pursue practical measures to minimise the impacts that airports have on communities that live around them. It is a simple proposition that airports are not islands. They have grown up in circumstances where the communities around them have changed over time. We have to acknowledge, however, that a proper balance needs to be set.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the last Labor government developed and implemented Australia's first-ever national aviation white paper, which strengthened the community consultation requirements and put in place transparent public oversight developments at Commonwealth leased airports. These measures include requiring all Commonwealth leased airports to establish community aviation consultation groups to address planning and development issues and a range of other operational matters, such as aircraft noise; establishing an Aircraft Noise Ombudsman; banning older, noisier aircraft flying over residential areas; obligating Commonwealth leased airports to submit more detailed master plans; and introducing a new major development plan trigger that is activated by any development with a significant community impact, regardless of the size or cost, ensuring communities get the opportunity to scrutinise developments which may be contentious within a local area, including proposed new flight paths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, Labor supports the April 2018 recommendations that were made by the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, following her investigations into the complaints about the introduction of the new flight paths in Hobart, including that Airservices access external expertise in community consultation to develop a 'more detailed community engagement strategy'. Labor also supports the ombudsman's recommendations that would strengthen Airservices' complaint management processes so as to ensure that the concerns of affected residents are managed effectively. These measures would benefit not only those who make complaints but also Airservices itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Australians generally acknowledge the importance of our aviation infrastructure. Labor have certainly always supported investment in Australia's aviation infrastructure. We are committed to supporting the growth of the industry, but growth must be underpinned by compacts between airports and local communities. The amended form of this bill, in our judgement, will help to ensure that airport planning processes remain transparent, while giving the industry the certainty to plan and invest for the longer term.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  The Airports Amendment Bill 2018 is evidence of the government going in entirely the wrong direction. It is not a particularly bad bill, like many that we see in the Senate, nor is it a particularly punitive bill, like some we have seen this weekâ€”such as the cashless welfare card billâ€”but it is a bill that is going in the wrong direction. It is yet another example of government being entirely wedded to making things easy for incumbent businesses and those with access and power, rather than looking after the interests of ordinary people in the community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through the changes that this bill makes. It wants to raise the threshold for airports needing to release major development plans. We already did this. In 2007, this parliament amended the act to raise the threshold from $10 million to $20 million. Why do we need to do it again?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What evidence does the government have that doing this is in the overall interests of the community? The major development plan process is a critical time for communities to be involved in the direction of airports and the impact that airports are going to have on them. It allows communities to see, comment on and engage with the activities of an airport and to ensure that their interests are protected. Why does the threshold need to be higher? It's only been a decade since we doubled the threshold, and here we are increasing it again. The government was proposing an increase to $35 million. It's good to see that it has been brought back to $25 million by amendments in the House. But the question remains: why are we going in this direction? What is the rationale for doing this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with the airport master plans. The development of master plans, like with the major development plan process, is one of the very few periods where we as members of a community get to see the direction that an airport is heading in. It is our key chance to make comments and to have input into that vision. This is so important for local communities, local residents and, in fact, local governments which co-exist with airports. But here we have the government trying to extend the period for when airports need to issue master plans, which basically will make it more difficult for the community to engage and it will be less frequent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose, yes, we should be grateful that the legislation doesn't require the major airports in our four larger cities to have their master plan cycle changed from the current five-year cycle. But why do we need to extend it to eight years for all of our other federally leased airports? Okay, it's in the interests of the airports, but it is not in the interests of the local communities that are affected by those airports. The government, of course, says that it has consulted on these changes. For a bit of discussion about this I turned to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bill</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span>, and we are told that in 2014, quite a while ago now, the then Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development circulated a discussion paper on efficiency proposals for the master plan and major development plan processes under the Airports Actâ€”that is, this was the beginning of the process underpinning what this legislation is enacting today. This discussion paper was apparently distributed to a range of stakeholders who fed into a second discussion paper for consultation in May 2015. The second discussion paper set out a number of recommended better regulation proposals, many of which are contained in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So where are these discussion papers? Where are the submissions? They certainly don't seem to be publicly available. Why does the explanatory memorandum not mention this consultation process or show any details of that consultation, particularly given that consultation now happened over four years ago and it has taken this long to get to this stage of enacting the results of the recommendations in legislation? Given the lack of documentation it's impossible to confirm this, but perhaps it's actually not useful for this government to have such a smoking gun of them listening entirely to the interests of the industry over the interests of the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the government has wisely decided not to go ahead with this proposed change, the worst idea in the original bill was to allow a proposed reduction in the public comment period from 60 days to 15 days in the event that the minister merely remained silent rather than the minister actively having to decide to allow a shortened comment period. We note that the minister currently has the power to do this, but only when the development is consistent with the airport master plan and doesn't raise any issues that have a significant impact on the local or regional community. How ridiculous would that have been, that simply by standing to the side and remaining silent the minister could create a 75 per cent reduction in public comment time? It's very illustrative of the regard that this government has for community consultation. It's very telling who they are really serving. It's the big business, the aviation industry, over the interests of local residents. We know that from the fact that that measure could even have been proposed. So we're glad to see that amendments that passed the House removed this proposed change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This attitudeâ€”governing in the interests of business, vested interests, political donors and their matesâ€”feeds the alienation that's driving our politics. Average members of the public are feeling that the deck is stacked against them and that the people who government are really listening to are big business and their corporate mates. We hear a lot from this government about red tape and regulation driving up the cost of doing business. I've got news for this government: community consultation and public and social licence are not red tape; they're the very stock of goodwill that underpins our democracy. When we destroy the ability of the community to be informed and have their say we are building the basis for community discontent, public backlash and, ultimately, the politics of division and anger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was part of a Senate inquiry into my private senator's bill which would have amended the Air Services Act to require a much higher degree of consultation by airports and aviation operators, and which would have better protected communities from air noise. We developed the bill because, currently, communities affected by airports feel disempowered, left out and that their concerns are just being paid lip service to. They feel that the current consultative mechanisms do not achieve the aim of communities' concerns being listened to and acted on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share a few choice comments from the witnesses at the hearing we had in Melbourne. Frank Rivoli, from the Hume Residents Airport Action Group, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The issues we raise are dismissed by the airport operator, stakeholders, the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities and Airservices, on the basis that the airport is an important piece of infrastructure and economic driver.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Frank said that since 2014, when he's been on the Community Aviation Consultation Group:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ it's made no recommendations which result in any worthwhile things for community, apart from some of the proposals to challenge some building proposals.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our concerns are not being addressed seriously. Aircraft noise answers are usually on the basis that there's nothing that can be done about aircraft noise. It's a product of aviation. Airservices says, 'We're doing our best to manage but our responsibility is to the safety of air travellers and so on'. They're the sorts of things.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'No point'. I know Frank, and I have met with him often about his concerns about the impact of Melbourne Airport on his community, on the suburbs of Gladstone Park, Tullamarine, Westmeadows and Broadmeadows. I know how genuine Frank is about acting for the benefit of his community. He's just the sort of person that governments and agencies rely on to give up their time and energy to be a conduit between them and the community. Our whole democracy relies on people like Frank. We know people are feeling disempowered about politics. They're cynical about politics. They're tuned out because they don't feel that anything they can do will make a difference. They feel that they lack agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you have a person like Frank, who tries his best to be involved, to be active and to participate in our democracy, and he says: 'There's no point. I'm resigning from the community consultative committee,' and gives up after so many years of trying to be meaningfully involved, that is serious. It's particularly serious for communities such as those that Frank represents. They are working-class communities, very multicultural communities and very diverse. The people are often doing their best to juggle working and surviving on low incomes, struggling with unemployment and feeling isolated and unvalued by the broader community. To have people like Frank say that there is no point engaging is a travesty. To have people like Frank standing up to represent the communities is a gift to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before standing for election to the Senate, I worked for a few years for Hume City Council, which covers the airport environs. I worked in the strategic planning department and I know how difficult it was to get people involved with the work that the council was doing. We ran workshops. We had leadership programs. We ran empowerment and community engagement programs to get people involved, to build social capital and to give them the sense that it was worthwhile engaging and that you could make a difference by being involved with activities that government was doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To trash that social capital by so-called community engagementâ€”community consultation which is nothing of the sortâ€”is an absolute travesty. It is running so-called community consultation exercises where people put themselves out to give their opinions and then find that nothing changes. Yes, they're asked to give their opinions, but those opinions aren't listened to. That damages our democracy immensely. It's the very thing that builds cynicism, builds resentment and builds a sense that the voices and the needs of ordinary people don't matter and that decisions of government are made because of the interests of the rich and powerful, the big corporations, not because of what's in the interests of ordinary people. In so many circumstances, that perception of people that they're not being listened to is absolutely accurate. Their voices are being ignored and bad things are happening to their communities. They are being deafened by unacceptable aircraft noise day and night, because the airports, the airlines and the aviation industry in general are the ones who hold all the power and who determine what happens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll share with you another quote from our hearing into my private senator's bill, my bill which would have changed that and would have required more meaningful consultation. In short, it would have given the community more power. Joe Biviano from the Moorabbin Airport Residents Association had this to say about the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When they get complaints about noise, they will defer that and say: 'That's not our responsibility. You need to speak to the airport.' Their role, as they see it, is to deal with the complaint-handling process. So if the complaint-handling process is not done effectively, they will look at that; they do not actually deal with noise issues or try to address the root cause of what a noise issue may be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This simply isn't good enough. We can't have consultation that's just a tick-and-flick exercise. In particular, the consultation that occurs around the times of major development plans and the airport master plans is critical. That's what has got to be done well. It has got to be at that time, because that is when you can have meaningful engagement and you can actually change the shape of what's going on at the airport so that these noise issues are ameliorated and reduced, reducing the impact on local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee report into my private senator's bill noted that it was clear to the committee that there are significant noise impacts that affected communities are facing which are not being considered, let alone addressed, within the existing consultation frameworks. Yet this bill is taking us backwards by reducing the requirements, and the time frames for community engagement on them, at the most significant time when there needs to be consultation: the major development plan and the master planning processes. It's in these processes that we should be upping engagement, not reducing it. That's why I want to foreshadow that the Greens will be moving a second reading amendment to the bill as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add ", but the Senate calls on the government to develop and implement better consultation and community engagement standards for federally leased airports, to mitigate the impact of air noise on communities under major flight paths."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If my second reading amendment were passed and implemented, it would go some way to addressing the serious issues that I have outlined this legislation is ignoring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, one thing I will say is that the Greens do welcome the requirement to include new air noise exposure forecasts in each master plan. This is a good change. But that alone is not sufficient to garner our support for this bill. This is a bill that deserves to go back to the drawing board. Although it looks like it is going to pass here today, we call on other parties and the crossbench to support our amendment as a call to action to the government to look after impacted communities instead of helping big business ride roughshod over them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  It is a pleasure to join my colleagues in speaking to the Airports Amendment Bill 2018. There are obviously a lot of important issues to consider in the context of laws relating to our airports and the impact they have on communities. Senator Rice was discussing that, and that is something I will touch on later. It is something I know Senator McKim is aware of in our home state of Tasmania. In fact, there's probably an affected residence on the Tasmanian peninsula. But that's something I will touch on a little later on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously airports right across our country are critical pieces of infrastructure for our economy, for the movement of people around our country to conduct their business, for leisure and also for freight of goods. That is something I know only too well in the state of Tasmania, where you have two options to get on and off the island: to go by boat or to go by plane. I think about 90 per cent of those coming in and out of our state come and go by air. So I know only too well how important it is that the legislative arrangements that relate to the future developments of our airports and the safeguards that are in place with regard to community consultation et cetera are as strong as possible. I believe this bill goes a long way towards doing that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noting that airports are important pieces of community infrastructure that we are all reliant on, this bill puts in place a number of elements that enable us to ensure that the works planned, proposed and done have appropriate scrutiny and appropriate consultation as well. As has been pointed to by the former Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Mr Chesterâ€”and I had a quick look at his second reading speech in the other placeâ€”when works are proposed at federally leased airports across the country, under the act dating from 1996 airports are required to prepare a master plan every five years and to establish a strategic direction for efficient and economic development at the airport as well as prepare major development plans for significant major on-air developments. Back home in Tasmania, a lot of things are on the radar for the Hobart International Airport that probably put it in the category we're talking about. I'll talk more about that little bit later on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The act sets out what the required content of each plan is to be and has prescriptions around the public consultation process that any lessee company must undertake prior to submitting the plan to the minister for final consideration. As was stated by the former minister, on average the current legislative process requires an airport lessee company to expend significant resources, and it can take a company two years on average to develop a plan. That's a huge undertaking, with a massive amount of resourcing going into ensuring that the plans comply with the requested standards as set out in legislation. It can take two years to develop and consult. As one would imagine through a two-year process, for a private organise entering into this process there would be a degree of inefficiency and imposition of administration and compliance costs which one would think to be quite unreasonable. So that's what this bill goes to, in some regardsâ€”dealing with some of those concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just turn quickly to the elements of the bill and what it proposes to do with regard to the master plan submission cycle for federally leased airports. I'm sure others have touched on this, but I will go over some of these details as well. When you look to the major airports, which include those in the cities of Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Sydney west, they will maintain the current five-year submission cycle. Then the remaining airports of Adelaide, Alice Springs, Archerfield, Bankstown, Camden, Canberra, Darwin, Essendon, the Gold Coast, Hobart, Jandakot, Launceston, Moorabbin, Parafield and Townsville will prepare a master plan every eight years, which I think is probably in keeping with the amount of development and growth that occurs at these particular airports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, as I'm sure has already been canvassed by previous speakers in this debate, also mandates the inclusion of a new Australian noise exposure forecast in each new master plan. I will talk in a little more detail about this later on, but obviously, with the increasing frequency of air traffic over residential areasâ€”in the case of Tasmania, it is over less densely populated areas but still an increase in trafficâ€”it is something that we should be taking into account as plans are developed. Of course, growth is forecast, and we have to make sure that the amenity, the lifestyle, of those who live under these flight paths will be taken into consideration appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also proposes to increase the current monetary trigger, which is set at $20 million, to $25 million, and of course to include an indexation mechanism to allow for increased building costs in the future, as benchmarks set in place today obviously will not be appropriate a decade hence. As I'm sure has been noted in this debate by previous speakers, there has been a good degree of negotiation between the government and the opposition on the monetary threshold trigger and also around provisions for approved requests from airports for shortened public consultation periods for major development plans. Now, if the minister doesn't make a decision within 15 days of the receipt of the request, the request is taken to have been refused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as I noted previously, there are some provisions that will go a long way to reducing the administrative burden on, and the associated cost to, proponents of developmentsâ€”the lessee companies. In the context of clients, users of airports, passengers and freight companies, this can only be a good thing. They will have an improved service at an improved facility. And one would hope that, when costs are not being borne by those who run, maintain and own these airports, the cost isn't being passed on to airport users, be they the airlines, their passengers or the freight clients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to some local issues. I have mentioned the Hobart airport, which is one of the federally leased airports. Senator Rice has touched on a number of issues with regard to noise. In Tasmania, we've recently had a significant amount of consternation over the issue of flight paths in and out of Hobart airport. The residents of the Tasman Peninsula, and communities just south-east of Hobart, in southern beaches that Senator Bilyk would be well familiar with, at Sorell and Midway Point, have all experienced significant changes around the flight paths. Airservices Australia, who are in charge of managing and regulating our air traffic and ensuring that it operates safely and in order, went through a process which, to the local community, was less than satisfactory. In short, the flight path of air traffic coming inâ€”over communities like Sorell and Midway Point, closer to the major population of Hobartâ€”was moved, to go out to the east and then to circle in over the Tasman Peninsula.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a very limited degree of public consultation around those changes, and of course that resulted in a great degree of consternation on the part of community members. Senator Bilyk and of course Senator McKim, who was present in the chamber earlier, would be well aware of that. There was the lack of consultation and then, all of a sudden, a great many flights overhead, in communities that were previously almost deadly silent when it came to air traffic noise. That has had a significant impact on members of those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So Airservices, who have acknowledged that the consultation process was more than deficient and could have been done better, have conducted further consultations. I was pleased to be able to attend one of the community consultation sessions in Sorell, which was well attended. Airservices convened quite a number of these throughout the communities affected. It is important to note that, wherever a flight path is going to be located, someone is going to be impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The feedback at the community forum reflected that there were some people who were very satisfied with the change of flight pathsâ€”those living in the communities of Midway Point or Sorell. As some of the people who got up and spoke at the forum said, they'd been living with planes flying overhead from approximately 6.00 am through to 11.00 pm every day for a great many years. They were pleased with the change because they now don't have planes flying overhead. They can sit out in their backyard and have a barbeque without having to yell at guests when a plane was flying overhead. A different story was relayed by those who live in the communities of Dunalley, Carlton, Dodges Ferry and some other Tasman Peninsula communities. They felt very aggrieved that all air traffic has now been redirected over their once peaceful communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, Airservices has been conducting extensive consultations, and they recently released the work that has come out of those consultation sessions. Airservices will continue to work with the communities affected and provide, I hope, some relief, because it is important to ensure that, when changes are proposed, people's lives are taken into account. In fact, there was one example of an individual wanting to start a new business just north of the community of Dunalley. It's been publicly reported that, until this issue is resolved, this individual will not be setting up his new business because of the impact of the noise on the amenity in the area he is situated in and where he intended to set up his business. So, this bill, as discussed earlier, is going to require every new master plan to include an Australian noise exposure forecast, and it will specify that the forecast must be renewed each time. That is good news, I think, for those who have been impacted previously. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hobart Airport, which is the one that is of most interest to the state of Tasmania, is going through extreme growth. Anyone who is aware of Tasmanian matters will be aware of the fact that Hobart Airport only recently opened its extended runway, in March this year. There was a huge investment in that airport. I think around $40 million was invested in the airport, predominantly from the Australian government. That investment was for a number of reasons. We have a growing visitor economy in Tasmaniaâ€”I'll return to the numbers shortly. We also have increasing demand for our fresh produce, so, of course, there's been a great degree of interest in setting up, establishing and maintaining a direct freight link with parts of South-East Asia so that they can have instant access to our fresh produce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other element to this, of course, is the fact that we have the status of being Australia's gateway to Antarctica, particularly East Antarctica. We recently saw the work being undertaken to create a paved, year-round runway in the East Antarctic region, which will enable us to have year-round access and not have to rely purely on sea access, which is incredibly important for our science community. There is a growing interest in Antarctic science and what it means for the world. These are major developments. They are costly. The changes that are being proposed, worked through and planned for at the airport will definitely be impacted by the need to create a major development plan as these works are proposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As stated, though, the extension to the runway does provide the opportunity for Hobart Airport to become home to some direct international flights. There's been talk of direct flights to New Zealand and to certain cities in South-East Asia. Some have also said we will be in receipt of direct flights to and from South America. They're all very exciting opportunities. But the increase in the number of passengers does put demand on infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was pleasing to see that Hobart Airport had originally planned for a certain amount of growth in terms of numbers. In their 2015 master plan, they had predicted that 2.6 million passengers would be passing through there each year by 2020. The problem was that, given the growth, the investments and the interest in Tasmania as a visitor destination, we've outstripped that prediction. You only have to look at the comments of the CEO of the Hobart International Airport corporation, Ms Sarah Renner. She said earlier this year that Tasmania would more likely see three million passengers a year come through the airport by the year 2022. That's a significant boost when you consider that we were in a state of decline when it came to visitor numbers. It means that Hobart Airport will have to factor in, amongst all the other major developments it is undertaking, some significant terminal works as well. The respected economist, Saul Eslake, has called on the airport to invest in aerobridges, for a start. There is the need to consider push-back mechanisms, like we have at our major airports, rather than the current arrangement at Hobart Airport where planes effectively turn on the spot. It will mean that we will have more efficient use of space. But, of course, these are all things that point to the need for proper management plans and making sure that we are appropriately planning for the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The board of the airport is considering its options in terms of major developments when it comes to a fresh produce export facility and exactly where on the site that will be. Again, it being federally-owned land leased to the Hobart International Airport lessee company, this facility will be, along with other works, I suspect, subject to a major development plan. Some experts in Hobart, like Mr Phil Pike and Mr Ian Locke, who is a Tasmanian fruit and vegetable export facilitator, predict that the fresh produce export side will grow by $15 million by the year 2021. This might sound like small change to some from bigger places, but in Hobart and in the state of Tasmania that's a significant amount of money, and that's a significant market we will be accessing through direct freight produce. Again, quoting Sarah Renner from Hobart International Airport, who is a proud supporter of the runway extension, having that direct freight link from Hobart to South-East Asian destinations means that you can have a punnet of berries being handpicked in the Coal Valley one day and then being shipped across and eaten in an Asian destination the next. The terminal itself will require internally significant upgrades to cope with the growing numbers, and aerobridges would require a second level. This would come at a significant cost to the proponents and to the owners of the airport as well. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these things are exciting to note. All of these things are very, very important to our community and to our economy. This legislation sets out how lessee companies are to proceed and how they are to take into account community concerns when it comes to things like aircraft noise, which, as I have said before, has been a significant concern in Tasmania and has been perhaps handled less than optimally in the case of the Hobart flight path. It is good to see some rules being set out and some efficiencies being found in how airport corporations are to move forward and exactly how they propose to undertake these developments, as well as some certainty and hopefully some efficiencies, which can only be a good thing for consumers. I am pleased to have spoken to this bill and I of course commend it. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I rise to briefly speak on the Airports Amendment Bill 2018. I support the remarks made by my colleague Senator Rice on this bill. This bill actually weakens planning regulations and community consultation processes for federally-leased airports. I'll get straight to the point: Western Sydney Airport in New South Wales. The Western Sydney Airport is a complete scam being foisted on the people of Western Sydney by the federal government and by the state government in New South Wales. The people of Western Sydney are being totally conned. They are being promised the world when the reality that this airport will bring will, really, be quite different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Sydney is being held to ransom. The government are saying: 'You will get significant infrastructure upgrades. You will get jobs, you will get public transport, you will get better roads, but only if you agree to this 24/7 curfew-free aerotropolis in your backyard.' They did not listen to the community at all. Here we are today talking about further weakening community consultation processes. They did not take into account community interests, because the only thing that this government is interested in is its mates in the big end of town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Sydney Airport will cause significant environmental and human health impacts due to air pollution, due to noise pollution and due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. That will exacerbate climate change. This is the crucial aspect of where this airport is being built. It will jeopardise the World Heritage listing of the unique Greater Blue Mountains area. Its environmental value will reduce and its quality will reduce. The economic benefits it brings to the local community will also reduce. The Blue Mountains City Council is opposed to the Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek due to the massive impact it will have on their local community, their quality of life and the environment. The government has totally ignored this while planning and developing the Western Sydney Airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about jobs. The government now is claiming that there will be 120,000 jobs in Western Sydney at some undetermined point way into the future. The way governments manipulate job data is just shameful and it becomes so completely meaningless. It is almost Monty Pythonesque. They used to go around saying that Western Sydney Airport will create 60,000 jobs, and now they have unilaterally doubled it. Meanwhile, the 2012 joint study on aviation capacity puts jobs growth closer to just 10,000 additional jobs by 2040â€”not the 120,000 this government is touting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Western Sydney are being sold a lemon by the political elite, who are saying they must take one for the team. What team is this? This is the team with big pockets. This is the team that is part of this whole game of mates, corporations and governments working together to fill these really deep pockets. Jobs for Western Sydney will come from government investment that meets the needs of the community, that meets the needs of the workers and that meets the needs of the employers instead of meeting the needs of the capital markets. We need to invest in public transport, renewable energy, manufacturing and the TAFE education sector. It will come when the state and federal governments stop spending billions on their pet projects and unjustifiable aviation fantasies and start putting it into public transport that serves the people and not the corporations. But there is one thing that will be undeniably good for Western Sydney; it will be good for jobs, it will be good for climate and it will be good for commuters. That one thing is high-speed railâ€”instead of this new white elephant airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labour market researcher Dr Ian Watson recently released a <span style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span style="font-style:italic;">obs</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">west</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report. Overwhelmingly, it shows that a strategy focused on high-speed rail could see Western Sydney become a manufacturing centre for this nation-building project. Dr Watson has said it would 'revitalise and stabilise manufacturing and construction in the region' and this would anchor other initiatives, including rebuilding the TAFE system to upskill the population and extending community banking to support small- and medium-sized businesses that join the supply chain. His report also shows that even on the government's own figures fewer than 120 jobs a year would go to Western Sydney locals during the construction phase of the Western Sydney Airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if we were a country that could dream big, that could construct nation-building projects like an east coast high-speed rail. Two of the busiest air routes in the world are in Australia. Sydney to Melbourne is the world's second-busiest air route, with more than 55,000 flights a year, and Brisbane to Sydney is the eighth-busiest in the world, with more than 33,000 flights a year. The demand for high-speed rail is there. All we need is the political will. The people of Western Sydney deserve much better than having a 24/7 polluting airport foisted upon them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  Thank you to those members who've contributed to the debate on the Airports Amendment Bill. The federal government regulates planning and development on federally leased airport sites through the Airports Act 1996. On 1 December 2016 the former minister, the Hon. Darren Chester MP, introduced the bill into the House of Representatives. The bill proposes several measures that were developed in consultation with key industry stakeholders to streamline certain administrative arrangements in the act relating to master plans and major development plans that are currently generating inefficient outcomes for industry as well as imposing unnecessary and onerous administrative and compliance costs. In particular, the bill proposes to implement a differential master plan submission cycle, therefore requiring the major airports, being Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydneyâ€”that is, Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airportsâ€”to main the current five-year submission cycle, while the remaining airports will provide a master plan every eight years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also proposes to increase the current $20 million monetary trigger for a major development plan to $25 million. This monetary threshold will be reviewed and revised by legislative instrument every three years, having regard to changes in construction activity costs and associated indexations to ensure that the monetary trigger accurately reflects and keeps pace with economic and marketplace conditions. The bill reinforces the government's commitment to improving the capacity of our regulatory framework to ensure that it continues to deliver a proportionate and efficiency based approach that reduces administrative and compliance costs for operators, creates regulatory certainty for industry and maintains appropriate and effective regulatory oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 February 2017 the bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by March last year. Following an accident at Essendon Airport, the Senate granted an extension of time for reporting, to 19 March this year. In March this year the committee recommended that the Senate pass the airports bill, and their report made it clearâ€”just for the avoidance of doubtâ€”that there is no linkage between the accident at Essendon Airport and the matters that are under consideration in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government contends that the bill will bring about positive changes for the aviation industry and airport users while still maintaining appropriate regulatory oversight, and this bill should be supported. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Amendment Bill 2018. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is an invaluable resource for health policymakers in this country. For the last 30 years it has been Australia's principal source for health and welfare data. It produces accurate and trustworthy statistical information and reports that contribute a great deal to our understanding of our collective wellbeing. It's well respected across the health sector for its independence, professionalism and ethical integrity. It has a broad remit. In the past month alone it has produced reports on everything from eye injury and palliative care services to smoking rates and disability support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a sense, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare is a diagnostic tool. It tells us precisely what's wrong with the nation's health so that we can put in place the policy and the prescriptions. Critically, it also tells us what we're doing right so we know where to double down. We think the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare does a terrific job. It provides a treasure-trove of accurate and reliable health data. Without the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare we'd often be flying blind, and the evidence based policy making in this country would be all the poorer for it. Labor values the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and wants to see it thrive. We want to see it continue to be as important and relevant as it has been for the last 30 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said all of that, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare exists in a radically different environment today than when it was established in 1987. It no longer enjoys the monopoly on the analysis of administrative health data. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has moved into this space as it has outgrown its traditional, narrow census-and-survey role. Policy agencies, like the Department of Health, are doing an unprecedented amount of their own in-house analysis. This all raises some pretty fundamental questions about the institute's role into the future, which is why the department commissioned a review of the institute in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nous Group review considered the institute's role, purpose, business model, product range, funding model, internal governance and organisation. The review made 35 recommendations, most of which do not require legislation. It recommended a change to the institute's funding structure, for better coordination between funding departments and better coordination with other information bodies. But its central finding was that the institute needs to undertake a major organisational transformation to secure its future as a leading information agency. That is primarily what this government bill aims to do. Labor is happy to support these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Act 1987 to make changes to the governance and administration of the institute. The bill's major provision is to establish a skills based board, replacing the current board structure in which members are selected based on the groups that they represent. Currently, the board includes representatives from Commonwealth departments, COAG committees and stakeholder groups, a structure which the review concluded had encouraged a focus on operational rather than strategic issues. The new board will have up to 12 members, including a chair, deputy chair, CEOâ€”renamed from directorâ€”up to three members nominated by the states, and six others. Each of these members will be required to have skills or experience in public administration, education, Indigenous health and welfare, data statistics, performance reporting, financing and corporate management, consumers' interests and/or law. Board members will be appointed for up to five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also reassigns responsibility for appointing board members from the Governor-General to the Minister for Health, a change intended to streamline the appointments and bring the institute into line with other health portfolio agencies. The bill also removes the requirement for the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to seek agreement from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to collect health and welfare related data, instead requiring it only to consult with the ABS as necessary. The bill also includes a number of other minor provisionsâ€”for example, setting out probity requirements for board members and procedures for board meetings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are not radical changes by any means, but Labor supports any measures that will help the institute reposition itself so that it remains relevant and even indispensable for the decades to come.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I rise to sum up on the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Amendment Bill 2018. The bill amends the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Act 1987. The bill will modernise governance arrangements at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare by implementing a board which collectively possesses skills or experience or significant standing in a range of different fields. Prescriptive eligibility requirements will be removed, as will ex officio positions and other representative positions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes will ensure that the board has the necessary expertise to focus on the key strategic issues and challenges faced by the institute in a market that is increasing in contestability for its services. The bill will recognise jurisdictional interests, with up to three members of the board to be nominated by state health ministers. This is critical to ensuring the ongoing production of high-quality and relevant data and statistics. The bill will ensure that vacancies are filled in a timely manner, with the Minister for Health, rather than the Governor-General, being responsible for appointments to the board. Furthermore, the measures will bring greater stability to the board through membership terms of up to five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also makes other amendments designed to improve the operations of the institute, including changing the title of the director to chief executive officer, assigning the board responsibility for appointing the chief officer and removing the need for ministerial approval of contract limits. The bill modifies the institute's functions in relation to data collection activities; the institute is to consult with, rather than seek agreement from, the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the collection of health and welfare related information and statistics. The bill also includes transitional arrangements to ensure that the chair and chief executive officer can continue in their positions for the balance of their current terms, along with clarification on delegation powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this bill, the board will be better equipped to focus on the strategic issues and challenges faced by the institute. The bill will also reduce the administrative burden associated with the appointment of new members to the board, resulting in greater stability and timely filling of vacancies. I thank members of the Senate for their contribution to debate on this bill and I commend the bill to this Senate. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  The majority of this bill makes a number of minor, technical and uncontroversial amendments to legislation relating to civil justice. The many amendments to existing legislation in this omnibus bill are intended to improve the operation and clarity of civil justice legislation, primarily by modelling, simplifying and clarifying existing provisions and by repealing redundant provisions. Some more-substantial changes to the existing legislation are also included in this bill, and I will briefly discuss those amendments shortly. This bill amends the following acts: Acts Interpretation Act 1901; Archives Act 1983; Bankruptcy Act 1996; Domicile Act 1982; Evidence Act 1995; Family Law Act 1975; International Arbitration Act 1974; Legislation Act 2003; Marriage Act 1961; and Sex Discrimination Act 1984. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was carefully scrutinised by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which reported on 10 May 2017. The committee received six submissions that commented on the proposed changes to five of these acts, and I will discuss these comments in more detail. The committee received no comments on the are remainder of the bill, which is not controversial. The committee made several substantial recommendations for improvement to the bill, subject to which the committee recommended that the bill be passed. Labor is pleased that the government is implementing those recommendations of the committee to make improvements to the bill and Labor is supporting the bill on that basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first recommendation of the committee that the government will implement relates to the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act. Schedule 3 of the bill will make an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act that will clarify that the Family Court of Australia has bankruptcy jurisdiction when a trustee applies to have a financial agreement set aside under the Family Law Act. Some submitters raised concerns about these amendments. The Law Council of Australia noted that the proposed amendments do not provide jurisdiction to the Family Court in bankruptcy in circumstances where a person has been discharged from bankruptcy, albeit that their estate remains vested in the trustee in bankruptcy. To remedy this, the Law Council recommended that the definition of 'bankrupt' and 'bankrupt party to a marriage' be clarified. The committee agreed with the Law Council and recommended that the bill be amended. Labor is pleased that the government has accepted the Law Council's advice and has acted on the recommendation of the committee by clarifying that a bankrupt includes a reference to a person who has been discharged from bankruptcy and whose property remains invested in the bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second recommendation of the committee that the government has implemented relates to the amendments to the Family Law Act. The bill makes a significant change to Australia's response to international parental child abduction, clarifies the range of persons who may perform the powers of the registry manager in the Family Court or any other court and improves the consistency of financial and other provisions for de facto and married couples. The bill contains provisions that would create new offences regarding retaining a child outside Australia in the Family Law Act. The explanatory memorandum notes that these provisions would remedy a gap in the existing legislation. The Australian Human Rights Commission raised concerns that there are circumstances where it would be inappropriate to expose parents or others to criminal sanctions for taking, sending or retaining a child outside Australiaâ€”for instance, where there is evidence that children are taken or retained abroad by parents fleeing family violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An analysis of return and access applications under the Hague convention revealed that 70 per cent of child abductors were women and that the most common reason for the abduction was fleeing domestic violence. The committee formed the view that the bill should be amended to include a defence of fleeing family violence to ensure that the existing and proposed offences of unlawful transfer and retention of children abroad do not apply in the circumstances of family violence. Labor is pleased that the government has accepted this recommendation of the committee. Labor is firmly committed to responding to family violence and supports measures that reduce gender inequality. That is why we believe in supporting legislative reform to deal better with family violence, as well as measures to improve the capacity of the judicial system to deal with family violence. This amendment will ensure that victims of family violence who take their children overseas with them to flee their abuser will not be committing an offence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was considerable debate over some months between the government and the opposition about the most appropriate form of these new provisions. Most of that debate was quite technical in nature and I will not recite the many iterations of these provisions here, but I note that the final form of the amendments to several of the provisions of this bill dealing with children being taken overseas are acceptable to Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Family Law Act currently provides that a person who is authorised by the court to arrest another person has powers related to the use of reasonable force in making the arrest and the powers of entry and search for the purpose of arresting a person. In its submission, the Attorney-General's Department noted that the current arrest powers in the Family Law Act are subject to fewer limits than the arrest provisions available to other federal courts, that they are broader than the arrest powers available to police officers in the Crimes Act 1914 and that they lack limits and safeguards. The bill authorises additional persons to make arrests under the Family Law Act, including a marshal, a deputy marshal, a sheriff, a deputy sheriff, a police officer or the Australian Border Force Commissioner. The bill also provides that the power to arrest another person is conferred on an APS employee in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scrutiny committee considered this bill and asked whether the bill could be amended to require a certain level of relevant training to be undertaken by APS employees authorised to exercise these coercive powers. The Australian Human Rights Commission also shared the scrutiny committee's concern. On this basis, the committee urged the government to amend the bill to limit the delegation of arrest powers so that they only apply to employees of the Australian Border Force who have received appropriate training. Labor is pleased that the government has proposed amendments to the bill which limit the APS employees authorised to exercise these powers only to employees of the Australian Border Force in order to ensure that coercive powers are only being delegated to appropriate persons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also repeals section 43 of the Sex Discrimination Act, which exempts discrimination against women in connection with employment, engagement or appointment in Australian Defence Force positions involving combat duties. Labor fully supports this change, which removes gender restrictions from combat roles and is an important step towards equal opportunity for women. Labor is pleased to support the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the Civil Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. As Senator Polley has outlined, the Civil Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill which would amend the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Archives Act 1983, the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Domicile Act 1982, the Evidence Act 1995, the Family Law Act 1975, the International Arbitration Act 1974, the Legislation Act 2003, the Marriage Act 1961 and, finally, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. It makes minor and technical amendments to modernise, simplify and clarify these pieces of legislation and repeal redundant provisions. The combined effect of these amendmentsâ€”the changes to this range of billsâ€”is to improve the efficiency and operation of the civil justice system in Australia, which, of course, is an ideal that I'm sure all in this place would agree with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government aims to make all Commonwealth legislation coherent, readable and accessible to the widest possible audience. To this end, this bill would amend the Acts Interpretation Act and the Legislation Act to clarify the validity of ministerial acts and the management of compilations of legislation on the Federal Register of Legislation. The government also aims to make Australia's archival record accessible to the broadest range of applicants possible. To this end, amendments to the Archives Act would assist the National Archives of Australia to appropriately manage requests for records from high-volume applicants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes other minor and technical amendments to the act. The proposed amendments in the bill simplify the interpretation of the Domicile Act by specifying within the act the territories to which the Domicile Act applies. This would replace an existing specification of territories in the regulations, allowing that regulation to be repealed. Again, this is about streamlining the legislative framework in this area and making it much more simple to understand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also amends the Evidence Act to align the time frame for the presumed receipt of postal articles with current Australia Post delivery times. Obviously, legislation needs to keep up with the times and be reflective of the realities of the modern world. The bill also reflects the government's commitment to maintain its place in the international legal environment by amending the International Arbitration Act to help ensure that Australian arbitration law and practice are on the global cutting edge so that Australia continues to gain ground as a competitive arbitration-friendly jurisdiction. Arbitration, whenever it is an option, is in the main much more cost-effective and has much better outcomes for all parties than having to go through lengthy and very costly legal proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act would repeal obsolete provisions. The bill would repeal the combat duties exemption in section of 43 of the Sex Discrimination Act that allows discrimination against women in connection with employment, engagement or appointment in Australian Defence Force positions involving combat duties. The exemption is no longer necessary, as the Australian government's policy to remove all gender restrictions from the Australian Defence Force combat roles was fully implemented on 1 January 2016. Repealing this provision is consistent with Australia's intention to withdraw its related combat duties reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. This is something that's had a long genesis, and it's very good to see the final elements of the legislative framework in this area being delivered by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see minor and technical amendments contained in the bill to improve the operation of the Family Law Act by clarifying existing laws, simplifying processes and eliminating some inconsistencies. This bill makes amendments to provide the same rights to de facto and married couples when instituting maintenance and property proceedings. The bill would also amend the Family Law Act to clarify the admissibility provisions in the Evidence Act relating to evidence obtained in an improper or illegal manner applying to evidence of disclosures of child abuse and communications between family consultants and family law litigants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would assist the operation of the Family Court of Australia in a number of ways. The bill would amend the Family Law Act procedure for appointing members to the Family Court of Australia Rules Advisory Committee to be consistent with the process for appointment of a similar committee advising the Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. Other amendments to the Family Law Act would clarify the range of persons who may perform the powers of the registry managers in the Family Court of Australia and any other court. The Bankruptcy Act would also be amended to clarify that the Family Court of Australia has bankruptcy jurisdiction when a trustee applies to have a binding financial agreement set aside under the Family Law Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill we are debating today also makes minor amendments to the Marriage Act. Many of these amendments are aimed at improving the operation of the Marriage Celebrants Program. These measures would enhance administrative efficiency by making improvements to the annual celebrant registration charge process. The bill also formalises an existing expectation that celebrants comply with any disciplinary measures that may be imposed by the registrar, and clarifies that the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants is a publicly available list published on the internetâ€”again, keeping our legislative framework in line with the modern world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would provide that where state or territory employees are appointed according to their position title to perform functions under the Marriage Act, they may be referred to on the register by their position title rather than their name. Some definitions and terminologies will be updated to ensure consistency with other legislation. The bill also clarifies that certain instruments made under the act are not legislative instruments and it remedies a defect in the legislation to remake provisions in relation to the Registrar of Overseas Marriages that were repealed in 2002.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, the intention of the bill is to make a number of minor and technical amendments to a number of acts to increase access to justice for all Australians by improving the operation and clarity of civil justice legislation. The amendments contained in the bill would improve the civil justice system by making it easier for individuals to understand and comply with the law. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I rise today to speak on a matter that has gained a lot of publicity, media coverage and political debate over the last five years, particularly from our political opponentsâ€”Labor, the Greens and their various supporters, including the unions, GetUp! and left-aligned think tanksâ€”running an increasingly misleading campaign about the levels of inequality in Australia. For example, the ACTU's Change the Rules campaign is a pretty blatant and dishonest attempt to return to an ugly class-warfare mentality in this country. We see it in the rhetoric employed by those opposite, supported by highly dubious evidence and very misleading statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Groups like the McKell Institute and the ACTU have released reports in recent times with highly misleading claims about the supposed 'crisis' of rising inequality in Australia. The McKell Institute report, for example, claims that 'inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high'. This number is arrived at using deeply flawed methodology, examining pre-tax income without accounting for the significant income redistribution that already occurs in Australia through our highly progressive tax system and our significant and very extensive welfare state. It is completely meaningless as an indicator of outcomes. This methodology completely ignores non-monetary transfers such as the provision of health care, education, infrastructure and other government services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been claims that our minimum wage is decliningâ€”something that is also demonstrably false. Since 1998, the minimum wage has increased by more than 20 per cent in real terms, and Australia has the second-highest minimum wage in the OECD. What about wealth inequality? There has been significant talk about rising wealth inequality in Australia, but the simple fact is that, for example, according to Credit Suisse, Australia has the third most equal distribution of wealth in the developed world, behind Japan and Belgium. I think it needs to be said: this is hardly a crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts simply don't support the conclusion that inequality is on the rise in Australia. Statistics from 2015 show that 10 per cent of taxpayers pay 50 per cent of income tax in this country. In anyone's language, that is a highly redistributive economy. According to a KPMG report, 60 per cent of households pay no net income tax once transfers are accounted for. Sixty per cent of households pay no net income tax! If you ever wanted evidence of how highly redistributive modern Australia is, this is surely it. The fundamental problem with the Left's obsession with equality as an outcome in the first place is that government should always focus on allowing society to create wealth and allowing individuals to have opportunity, rather than mythologising on inequality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's always worth having a quick look back at recent history. Some personal recent history: my fatherâ€”so one generation agoâ€”rode a horse to school. He grew up on a farm. They made their own power and were not connected to the grid; it was 32 volt electricity. In fact, we were only connected to the grid in this century. When dad was young, it was a party-line telephone system. The idea of everyone having a mobile phone was from sci-fi fantasy land. Yet that's where we are today. None of these things are taken into account when the Left talks about income inequality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On our side of the chamber, we believe in the creation of wealth for all and opportunities for all. We believe in reward for effort. We believe in letting hardworking Australians keep more of what they earn. We believe in growing the pie so that all Australians can live a better life. That's why we have legislated tax cuts for all Australians, coming into effect as early as next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her final prime ministerial question time, the late Margaret Thatcher was asked about increasing inequality over her 11 years of office. She famously responded:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">People on all levels of income are better off than they were in 1979. The hon. Gentleman is saying that he would rather that the poor were poorer, provided that the rich were less rich.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the fundamental flaw in the argument of those opposite. This government has implemented policies designed to create more wealth for everyone, not merely to redistribute it in a different way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, if we look back in history, it is not that many hundreds of years ago in the majority of societies on the majority of this planet that the vast majority of people, 90 per cent of people, lived subsistence lives. They lived to grow enough to eat to continue to live. There was very little surplus generated and what surplus there was was taken by very few. How do you compare income equality in a society where an absolute monarch theoretically owns absolutely everything? Instead, people on the left want to focus on a very short span of history and want to focus on very narrow measures of equality that reveal very little about the way people actually live their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, let's look at the record since 2013. More than one million jobs have been created and the vast majority of those jobs have been created by Australian businesses. It was not by government but by Australian businesses employing people, giving people an opportunity and giving income to families so that they can make more of their own lives. We have cut company tax for more than 3.2 million small businesses, employing more than 6.7 million Australians. The small businesses of Australia should never be forgotten when we are considering the policy framework under which we operate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have legislated, as I've said, tax relief for hardworking Australians. This is an historic reform that will see 94 per cent of Australians pay no more than 32c in the dollar in income tax. This is a massive win for working Australians, who deserve to keep more of what they earn. We have grown our export industries, inking trade agreements with China, Japan, South Korea, Peru and Indonesia, as well as taking a lead in the TPP-11 negotiations. We have invested a record amount in nation-building infrastructure: $75 billion. This is how this government is creating wealth for everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind all Australians that you can never tax your way to prosperity. It's absolutely impossible. It's time that we moved on from this class-warfare mentality. In fact, I thought that as a society we had moved on in the eighties, but it seems we are back there again.</span>

                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I rise today to make a statement about Labor's commitment to health. Specifically, I draw the Senate's attention to a local campaign for a new Medicare-funded magnetic-resonance-imaging licence at Redcliffe Hospital. Corinne Mulholland, Labor's outstanding candidate for the federal seat of Petrie, launched this community campaign last month, calling for the federal government to step up and deliver for locals. Labor believes that Australians should have access to world-class health treatment and diagnosis facilities as close as possible to where they live. Obtaining a new MRI licence would enable patients in Redcliffe and surrounding areas to access life-saving medical scans onsite at the local hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those listening to this speech who are unfamiliar with the term 'magnetic resonance imaging', or MRI, it is a method of scanning using magnets and radio frequency pulses. Signals from inside the body are detected by a radio antenna and then processed by a computer to create images. There are different types of MRI scans that can be conducted, depending on the information required by the referring medical specialist. MRI can be the best way of diagnosing certain problems, such as injuries to knees, the brain or spine, and can complement other tests, such as X-rays or ultrasounds. MRI can also be used to diagnose developmental anomalies, infection and multiple sclerosis, as well as a number of life-threatening conditions, such as brain tumours, stroke and dementia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at the record of those opposite on the issue of health. Under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison Liberal-National government, Queenslanders have lost out on health big time. We know that Mr Turnbull successfully implemented his GP tax, with Australians now paying around $4 more out of their own pocket every time they go to the doctor. Patients are now over $12 more out of pocket when they need to see a specialist. And now we see more vicious, cruel cuts to the country's health budget. Let's just go through those: $715 million ripped out of hospitals around the country, with $160 million ripped out of Queensland hospitals. That's the equivalent of slashing the jobs of 1,435 nurses in our state. Brisbane's dedicated children's hospital, Lady Cilento, has suffered a $6.5 million cut. The Metro North health district has lost $32 million under the Liberal-Nationals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at where some of that's coming from: $14.3 million from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, $7.7 million from the Prince Charles Hospital at Chermside and $2.9 million from the Caboolture Hospital. We learnt during the Longman by-election recently just how locals felt about that. For the Redcliffe Hospital there has been a $4.2 million funding cut. That's the equivalent of 37 fewer nurses working at Redcliffe Hospital. What's worse is that the Queensland government is still waiting for the Liberal-National federal government to pay up the $780 million owed for procedures delivered as far back as 2014; $128 million of that is activity funding owed to Metro North Hospitals like Redcliffe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While these bills were going unpaid by this governmentâ€”while these health cuts were happeningâ€”what did the local Liberal member, Mr Luke Howarth, do or say? Nothingâ€”not a thing. Did he stand up for his community on health? No. Did he stand up for local seniors, families and children who use the Redcliffe Hospital, the Prince Charles Hospital, the RBWH or Lady Cilento? No, no, no and no. Did he stand up in Canberra and say, 'Look, guys: we probably should be paying our bills'? No, he did not, and on that matter I want to emphasise the fact that this federal government has had form in not paying to Queensland the money that is due for funding for services and procedures already delivered by the Queensland hospital system. Under Mr Turnbull the federal government spent 51 weeks arguing over what was undisputed fundingâ€”and there is still funding missing, as I've indicated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To go back to late last year, the Queensland health minister, Mr Miles, had to write to his federal counterpart to seek urgent action over a funding black hole that would blow out to almost a billion dollars by 2019. I used to think coalition governments would respect the fact that you have to pay your bills on time but, obviously, that is now out the window.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's return to Mr Howarth and what he did. If we look further at Mr Howarth's record on other matters we can see that he also stayed quiet while his government prioritised banks over schools. He stayed quiet while local workers struggled with cuts to their penalty rates. And he has said nothing about how energy prices and poor internet access have been hurting small businesses and households in his electorate. Then, during the August sittings of parliament, it all became clear: the Liberal member for Petrie was too busy plotting the overthrow of Mr Turnbull. He was too busy plotting the uprising of his mate in the electorate next door, the federal member for Dickson, Mr Dutton. And, yes, as the news of the appalling events of the last sittings leaked out it emerged that it was Mr Howarth who was planning to call for Mr Turnbull's resignation, despite having said in April that he would not support a leadership challenge. So Mr Howarth cannot be taken at his word, and, given his actions in the leadership spill, I can't imagine that the Petrie electorate is now on the top of new Prime Minister Morrison's priority list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the people in the Petrie electorate are at the top of Corinne Mulholland's priority list. As I said, she is our candidate for the federal seat of Petrie. Restoring the Liberal-National cuts to health and education are absolutely on top of Labor's priority list. Locals know that Redcliffe Hospital needs and deserves a Medicare-subsidised MRI machine. Labor has a proud record on MRI licences, granting 238 of them when we were last in government. Madam Acting Deputy President Kitching, it's probably no surprise to you that, in the last five years of this Liberal-National government, only five MRI licences have been granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve better when it comes to health. Queenslanders deserve better when it comes to our local hospitals. Patients visiting Redcliffe Hospital deserve access to an MRI, without having to pay to go private or to travel long distances. I encourage listeners to visit www.RedcliffeMRI.com and add their voices to the hundreds who have already signed the petition and joined our campaign. Together we can protect and grow the Redcliffe Hospital with a new MRI licence, and together we can show the chaotic, divided Liberal-Nationals the door and elect a new representative for the Petrie electorateâ€”a representative who listens and cares; a representative who fights for the needs of locals, rather than their own self-interest and plotting and scheming; and a representative who works as part of a team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a federal Labor government now more than ever to restore stability and fairness to government and to bring back equality and the fair go. This is what Labor stands for and this is what Corinne Mulholland is fighting for in Petrie. We know that MRIs are a hugely important part of the medical system at the moment. I note that there has been a recent Senate report into the use of MRI in Australia. I also note that it has been highlighted that under our current system MRI machines are less likely to be found in less affluent suburbs than in suburbs with more affluent residents. So, there is a need for this campaign to succeed. There is a need for residents in the Redcliffe area to have access to this lifesaving technology. I encourage everybody to get on board with this campaign. It is such a worthwhile one and is illustrative of the efforts of our campaign in the Petrie electorate.</span>

I planned to make this statement before the horrible, tragic deaths of two Aboriginal boys in Perth on Monday afternoon. My heart goes out to their families and their community. Their community is in deep mourning and grief. This tragedy should never have happened. It has been treated as 'deaths in police presence' or, as others are calling it, 'deaths in custody'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> published their Deaths inside database. The database is the product of <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>'s own investigations into deaths in custody since the completion of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991, which exposed the number of lives lost in a system that continues to fail our First Nations peoples. As <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> points out, one of the 339 recommendations of the royal commission was to establish a national program implemented by The Australian Institute of Criminology to track and report on further deaths in custody. The intention was to ensure that these issues remain firmly within the public view, yet, when <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>went searching for the data, it could not be found.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the arduous task of requesting reports from each state and territory and manually collating the data, plus analysing over 460 coronial reports from the past decade, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> has highlighted what successive governments have failed to addressâ€”that following the completion of the royal commission there have been a further 407 deaths in custody of First Nations people. We already know that First Nations peoples are disproportionately represented in our prisons. As of 30 June 2017 there were 11,307 prisoners who identified as First Nations peoples, representing 27 per cent of the total prison populationâ€”a travesty in the first place. <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>'s analysis of 463 cases between 2010 and 2015 found 31.5 per cent of the deaths in custody involved an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person. This is despite First Nations people representing only 3.3 per cent of the Australian population. So not only are they disproportionately represented in our prisons but they are also more likely to die while in the custody of our police and corrective services. This is our national shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                  </span>
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> identified 147 cases of First Nations peoples dying while in custody over the past decade. There have been four deaths this year alone. Of the 147 people in these cases, more than half had not yet been convicted of their alleged crime, were being held in protective custody or were being pursued by police, typically for minor crimes, such as public intoxication, that carry sentences of less than five years. These people subsequently paid with their lives. This includes teenagers as young as 13 years old.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look more deeply into the database of the deaths, you will discover some devastating statistics. In 46 of the cases, it was found that the authorities failed to follow correct procedures. In 35 cases, the person who passed was injured, leading to death, whilst being pursued or placed into custody. Thirty per cent of the cases involved authorities providing an insufficient level of medical care, ultimately resulting in death. Thirty-eight per cent of the cases involved people with a mental health condition or cognitive impairment. Forty-five per cent of the deaths were the result of medical issues, many of which involved conditions that would normally be easily treatable. As I said, this is our national shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going through the coronial reports, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>'s report highlighted instances of insufficient pain management practices, incorrect treatment and medical care, and insensitive treatment of family and loved ones. In one instance, police ignored requests for heart medication following the arrest of a 50-year-old man in South Australia, resulting in his becoming unresponsive and unable to be revived. In another instance there were accusations corrective services guards ignored the pleas of a diabetic and schizophrenic man who claimed he could not breathe after being issued with a sedative. The guards then incorrectly applied resuscitation techniques. In yet another instance a man experienced respiratory failure while being pinned down, handcuffed and tranquilised in hospital. He arrived at the hospital voluntarily seeking treatment for hearing voices. It is simply unacceptable that we have people dying in custody as a result of inadequate medical attention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the cases of suicide, with 20 separate instances in the past decade. Many of these involved hanging incidents within cells and common areas. This is despite the royal commission making specific recommendations around the removal and visibility of hanging points in prisons.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eighteen of these deaths occurred in road accidents when evading the police or as a direct result of police pursuits. In many of the 147 cases, relatives or friends of the deceased people spoke about their fear of being caught by the police. This year a 31-year-old man from New South Wales fell from a 13-storey balcony in his efforts to avoid being caught. Family members said he feared being bashed by the police if caught. This is Australia and this is the reality for our First Nations people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> has done a great job with its analysis, and I for one thank the newspaper for shining a light on this issue and doing the work that should have been done by state, territory and federal governments if they really, truly cared. If it weren't for the investigation by <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>, these findings would have remained buried and the lives of these First Nations people would be just another case number in a failed system. We shouldn't have to rely on external research to tell us this issue still exists. This data demonstrates how successive governments have failed when it comes to providing the support required for our First Nations peoples and implementing the 339 recommendations of the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We absolutely need justice targets in this countryâ€”state, territory and Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has continued to shirk its responsibility to show leadership on this issue. We need to be addressing incarceration rates. Why is it that in 2018 we still have disproportionate representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our justice system? Why is it that all states aren't on board yet with the custody notification system? In an area where the government has shown a bit of leadership in offering to help fund it, we still don't have it rolled out across the country to an adequate level. We know it helps to reduce deaths in custody. Why aren't we providing medical attention? For heaven's sake! Againâ€”it's 2018; why aren't we providing that attention? Is it something to do with the fact that states and territories can't access Medicare for prisoners? We need to be revisiting that issue as well. We need to be retraining and taking it seriously. When states like WA apologise for biased treatment from the police, follow it up with meaningful action!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We think that the federal government needs to show true leadership and call an urgent meeting between the states, the territories and the Commonwealth to finally address this issue. Otherwise people are going to be standing in this parliament in years to come, quoting more dreadful, awful statistics. This issue absolutely has to be addressed. We need to make sure that all the recommendations from the royal commission are implemented. We need to be doing more because there's more that needs to be done. This government needs to show leadership and drag the states and territories to the table, by hook or by crook, and require them to make change so that future generations don't end up in jail as another statistic.</span>

I had the honour of attending one of them recently, and that was at the 15th anniversary of the C3 Church in Belconnen. I attended with Alistair Coe, Leader of the Opposition in the ACT Legislative Assembly and leader of the ACT Liberal Party. I want to take this opportunity to thank pastors Nick and Melissa Hind and the entire church community for hosting me at their wonderful facility. C3 Church Belconnen is active in the local community, running music programs for parents and young children and anxiety counselling services and courses, and supporting a number of local groups. I thank the church for this contribution. I've seen the work of C3 in Tuggeranong in particular, where they do an outstanding job, as do so many of our other faith based communities. But C3's work in the Belconnen community is really valuable, and it was a real pleasure to be able to celebrate this milestone with the church community. Nick and Melissa are a great family team, leading that church community, and I look forward to seeing their great work continue into the future, hopefully not just for another 15 years but well beyond.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also pay tribute to a couple of our great local small-business owners in Tuggeranong. Clinton and Shubana Sheehan own and run the Erindale Cakery Bakery, and can I say it is absolutely delicious. They gave me a tour of their bakery and gave me and my staff perhaps too many goodies to take away. But they do some really delicious stuff. The Sheehans have owned Cakery Bakery since 2011 and make everything they sell fresh on-site. I think they employ about 30 staff. A lot of young people who get their first job at the bakery get trained up. It's great that this family-owned business is employing young people in the Tuggeranong Valley. They're down at the Erindale shops. It's also great to see them thriving after a fire in a neighbouring shop that forced them to shut their doors. I know a lot of people in the community missed the great treats they usually got from Cakery Bakery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses like Cakery Bakery run by regular Australians like Clinton and Shubana need all of the support they can get. I'm very proud to be part of a government that is backing small business. We're doing that through instant asset write-offs, small-business tax cuts and red tape relief. We support our small business community in every way we can. I want to wish them all of the best, and I thank Clinton and Shubana for all of the work they do and for hosting me at the bakery recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Canberra we have an amazing Indian communityâ€”an absolutely amazing, growing, thriving Indian communityâ€”and they've been making a great contribution to Canberra for many, many years. That's why I was absolutely delighted recently to have the opportunity to speak at the celebration of the 72nd Indian Independence Day. We had a celebration at Duffy Primary School last month. This fantastic event was hosted by the India-Australia Association of Canberra, which is a volunteer organisation based in Canberra providing community services here and in the surrounding region. It has been doing that for the last 39 years, and I was really honoured recently to be asked to become their patron. I want to particularly recognise Dharminder Sharma and Sandi Mitra for inviting me along to make a presentation and for hosting me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sandi is well known to many Canberrans. He is one of those people who is just so committed to his community. He is committed to his family. He works so hard. I see him in his workplace, but I also see him, when he has spare time, serving his local community with the India-Australia Association of Canberra. He is just everywhere. Sandi is one of those people who helps to make our community thrive. He's one of those people who really helps communities to integrate. When we've got amazing people like Sandi and an Indian community doing great things in Canberra, it is something that we can be very, very proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also particularly honoured to present Mr Kanti Jinna with felicitations in celebration of his being awarded with an Order of Australia earlier this year. Kanti is also very well known in the local Indian community in Canberra. Beyond that, he is one of those tireless servants of the community. He's a fantastic fellowâ€”always smiling, always with a good story to tell. I want to formally congratulate Kanti on a well-deserved honour that was recognised at Duffy Primary School last month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The valuable work of the IAAC goes far beyond hosting big events. It was founded in the seventies here in Canberra. The organisation aims to remove barriers and to facilitate relationships between the Indian and Australian cultural communities. Its volunteer team works tirelessly to create inclusive events, to promote understanding between a collection of cultures and to offer support to Indian migrants who are settling in the region or who require assistance with disability, aged-care and other community services. The organisation also provides various services in an effort to help Indians and all other Indo communities settle down in Canberra and make them feel at home away from home. I want to congratulate IAAC on the amazing work that it does serving our community and, particularly the Indian-Australian community here in the ACT.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have many, many talented science students here in Canberra and right across the ACT. I was honoured recently to be hosted by Simon Vaughan, who is the principal of Melrose High School, and shown how he and his team at Melrose are helping budding young scientists explore their passion for science through projects and investigations in their classes. Some of the projects the students are working on are at such a level they are under the supervision of some of our amazing researchers from the University of Canberra. I got to visit the science labs and hear from many students who could explain genetics to you far better than most adults certainly could. We even had one brave student demonstrate the science of direct currents and electrostatics with a Van de Graaff generator. I don't know if you've ever seen that. You hold onto it and your hair stands on end. It's quite a fun science experiment. The possibilities of where a passion for science can take you are wide open particularly for students here in Canberra with our great institutions like CSIRO, ADFA and our universities, which can lead to endless career opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was further inspired by some of our young ACT students at the greenlight for girls event here in Canberra recently. I think it was also at Melrose High, from memory. There were more than 100 girls, from all over the ACT, gathered to hear from female leaders in STEM fields and learn about different careers in STEM. There has been much talk in this place, in recent times, about the vital importance of STEM careers and I hope all young students know that every opportunity is open to them, and they should pursue any subject they have a passion for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The greenlight for girls event demonstrates the link between STEM and everything around us in a fun and interactive way. Participants were inspired by hands-on workshops led by role model professionals in STEM. Each girl was given the chance to experience four 45-minute workshops throughout the day. The girls enjoyed being led through various activities by naval engineers and cybersecurity experts and heard from computing experts. They had a great day celebrating the possibilities of STEM during National Science Week. The day was led by the Girl Guides, here in the ACT, who do an amazing job, and they received grant funding from the coalition government as part of the Inspiring Australiaâ€”Science Engagement Program to bring the event to fruition. Thank you to Michelle Cothe and her brilliant team for putting together an inspiring and engaging day for so many young girls. My daughter participated in it and I know she had a wonderful day. I look forward to hearing more about our future scientists, engineers and mathematicians and the life-changing work they are set to do in the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time I have left I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the outstanding achievement of the ACT's very own Rohan Dhooria, on the occasion of winning the national title for under-21s in the Australian Table Tennis Championships. Well done! I'm told the final was one for the ages. After trailing 3-1 Rohan came back from the brink to claim the under-21 men's singles crown, taking the title 4-3 over Dominic Huang. Nineteen-year-old Rohan Dhooria is the only ACT player to hold two national titles, having won the under-15s in 2014 and now under-21s in 2018. Rohan has a goal to represent Australia at the coming Olympic Games in Tokyo as well as the Commonwealth Games. I wish him all the very best in his future endeavours. As someone who has only played table tennis in the rumpus room rather than competition I have the greatest respect for people who can play it at such a high level. There is certainly intense competition in our house, and I can only imagine what it's like in Rohan's house! Well done to Rohan and congratulations on an amazing achievement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  Firstly, today, I am speaking about one of the most essential services for all Australians: the Bureau of Meteorology Their observations and weather forecasts are relied on by people in all sorts of professionsâ€”farmers, transport workers, seafarers and aviators, just to name a few. It helps our emergency services to predict and manage natural disasters and to issue warnings and advisories to the public. The bureau's forecasts are watched closely by recreational fishers, bushwalkers and surfers. They also provide valuable data to our Antarctic researchers and climate scientists. The bureau's services are also relied on by Australians daily, when they're planning to go out, to determine what they might do or even what they might wear. It's incredible how much we rely on these services for our day-to-day decisions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bureau of Meteorology is valued and trusted by all Australians. That's why I and my Tasmanian federal Labor colleagues have been extremely disturbed about recent reports that the bureau is moving local forecasting services interstate. Under the plan, forecasting services in most states, including Tasmania, will be moved to national forecasting teams in Melbourne and Brisbane. So much for decentralisation! The Community and Public Sector Union Tasmanian branch secretary, Madeline Northam, described it this way:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What the bureau is proposing is essentially creating two weather sausage factories, where staff in Melbourne or Brisbane will churn out weather forecasts for the whole country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that other branches of the CPSU have also raised concerns about the loss of forecasting services in their states. One of the concerns that has been raised by the union is the risk to local communities during extreme weather events. This is particularly worrying when there is more than one major incident happening across Australiaâ€”the fear being, of course, that the larger population centre will get the most attention. The Tasmanian unions covering parks and forestry, firefighters and the State Emergency Service have described the decision as stupid and short-sighted. Gavin Cashion from the Police Association of Tasmania has raised concerns about how the loss of local forecasting could impact on Tasmania Police's search and rescue capability on both land and sea. Leigh Hills from the United Firefighters Union of Australia said that it's absolutely crucial to have local knowledge during fuel-reduction burns and high-fire-danger periods. CPSU Tasmania's general secretary, Tom Lynch, has warned that the bureau's decision will put lives at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerns have also been raised by farming groups. Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia president, Tony Seabrook, said that the bureau could become a faceless organisation. He also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ farmers make day-to-day decisions based on the forecasting that we get, and they can be very significant decisions to do with livestock welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ based on previous experience, the further away from the centre of activity that people like forecasters are, the less likely we'll get the accurate forecasting that we need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They may say with computers they can do it just as well, but somehow or another most of us will have a grave fear that the centralisation of forecasting may actually mean forecasting â€¦ might not be as accurate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My Tasmanian federal Labor colleagues and I are concerned about what this decision means for the quality of observations and forecasts in our state. Tasmania's federal Labor members and senators have written to the new Minister for the Environment, Ms Price, seeking an explanation as to why the change is actually necessary, and a guarantee that it will not adversely impact on forecasting in Tasmania.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Prime Minister has provided an assurance there will be no job losses at the bureau in Tasmania, this provides no comfort whatsoever to the Tasmanian community that the quality of local forecasting services will be maintained. In fact, it doesn't really give me any sense of assurance, either, because I want to know what the impact of the changes is on staff. We haven't been told yet, so we don't know. To be honest, the government's hollow assurances really don't reassure us all that much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Tasmanians are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the bureau's excellent record when it comes to providing accurate and trusted observation and forecasts. We firmly believe that local forecasts are best undertaken by employees with local knowledge and local experience. Nonetheless, as I said, we look forward to the minister's explanation, which I urge the minister to provide as a matter of urgency.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a different subject, Acting Deputy President Kitching, did you know there are over 1,000 species of wattle in Australia? They inhabit our landscape like no other plant. They are quintessentially Australian. Thoughts of wattle are intrinsically tied to thoughts of Australia. The two are intertwined and really difficult to separate. Since 1988, when the golden wattle was officially gazetted as Australia's national floral emblem, wattle has become as much a symbol of our national identity as the Australian flag or <span style="font-style:italic;">Advance</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Fair</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first known use of wattle as an emblem in the Australian colonies was in fact in Hobart town in 1838, when a resident suggested wearing a sprig of wattle to celebrate the golden jubilee of European settlement of Australiaâ€”although on that occasion it was silver and black wattle, as golden wattle was yet to be introduced to Tasmania. Wattle Day was first held on 1 September 1910 in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Since 1992, national Wattle Day has been held on 1 September in all of Australia's states and territories. Before then, Australians in different states celebrated Wattle Day on different days between August and September.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1993, Wattle Day has held an additional meaning. The Australian Republic Movement has adopted this unique celebration as a day to campaign for an Australian head of state. In Tasmania, a Wattle Day barbecue was held at the appropriately named Republic Bar in Hobart. These barbecues were held nationally to allow Australians to start conversations about constitutional reforms to allow an Australian head of state. I was proud to celebrate Wattle Day and campaign for an Australian head of state with my Labor Senate colleagues Senator Brown and Senator Singh, along with Angela Wilson, Tasmanian Branch Convenor of the Australian Republic Movement. Ironically, the Republic Bar was previously named the Empire Hotel, showing how times have changed and how attitudes have changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the 1999 referendum seems like a distant memory to many, the movement for Australia to stand on its own two feet as a proud, independent nation still has plenty of momentum. There are now almost four million more people on the electoral roll than there were then. This includes a whole new generation of Australians who couldn't vote at the time of the referendum 19 years ago. Of course, some of them weren't even born. So, it's time for this issue to be revisited. Labor has pledged to hold a national vote on an Australian head of state during the first term of a Shorten Labor government. The question we will put is simple: do you support an Australian Republic and an Australian head of state? This avoids the divisive debate we saw on the last referendum that clouded the issue by proposing a model that the Australian people were not in favour of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot repeat the mistakes of the 1999 referendum and give Australians one vote in order to settle two questions. If the yes campaign is successful, it will be followed by further debate and a vote about what the most appropriate model is, but the first hurdle is to get agreement for an Australian head of state in some form. We do not argue for a republic out of any disrespect for the Queen or her heirs, but the United Kingdom is a long way from Australia both geographically and, increasingly, culturally. There are no good reasons that the descendants of the winners of battles and invasions on an island on the other side of the world hundreds of years in the past should be the heads of state of our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is unique. Our land and our society are distinctive in the world. Our Indigenous culture is the world's oldest culture, and much of our plant and animal life is unique to this continent. Our landscape is unlike that anywhere else. We are a great success story as a society. One in four Australians were born overseas, and almost half have a parent who was born overseas. We have created a multicultural society that believes in fairness, tolerance and mateship. From across the seas, hundreds of different people have relocated under the Southern Cross in the hope of a better life. They have grown with our nation and, in turn, our nation has grown with them. It's time for our nation, like the old Empire Hotel in north Hobart, to change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  It may not be apparent to Australians, but the president of China, Xi Jinping, has something in common with a notorious Australian. I would invite members of the Senate to speculate on who that might be and what it might be that they have in common. We all know that the president of China is president for life. What Australian would seek to be president for life? I could not think of anything more abhorrent to our democracy, anything more un-Australian. The Anzacs went to war to protect and defend our democracy. It is the right of every Australianâ€”that is, provided that you are not a member of One Nation, because One Nation is the most un-Australian, undemocratic organisation in history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson has declared herself president for life, just like the president of China. James Ashby told her to, because Jimmy controls her 24/7â€”the not-so-faceless man of One Nation. She is the only Australian, and One Nation the only political party in Australia, that follows the dictatorship model. There is no election for the leader or president of the party, no election for the national executive and no election for the state executive. What you see is what you get, forever, unless president for life decides otherwise. 'Jimmy told me so.' Wikipedia states: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">President for life is a title assumed by or granted to some leaders to remove their term limit irrevocably as a way of removing future challenges to their authority and legitimacy. The title sometimes confers on the holder the right to nominate or appoint a successor.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at who she and Jimmy have hand-picked for the national executive. Who are they? Well, let me go through them one at a time. First is Pauline Hanson, president for life. 'Disagree with me and you're gone.' She once described herself as the 'mother of the nation' and more recently as 'senator for Australia'. Second is James Ashby, the proud holder of a criminal record and a diary thiefâ€”the man who brought down Peter Slipper. Jimmy is the man who shares a unit with the president for life here in Canberraâ€”a close relationship of no benefit to members of One Nation. He is a man who stalks my staff, both physically and by carrier service, as well as sending me vile text messages. The judge in the Ashbygate case described Jimmy as a 'psychopath'â€”how true. Third is Sean Black, a convicted rapist and wife basher. Fourth is Alex Jones. I don't really know him, but he would be a yes-man. Fifth is Michael Pucci, a prolific bully. He was considered for dismissal from employment for bullying but was instead promoted to the executive because president for life likes somebody with a bit of mongrel in them. That is why she hand-picked never-was-a-senator Roberts as the lead Queensland candidate for the Senate at the next federal election. She thinks he has a bit of mongrel in him. 'Jimmy told me so.' No other Australian political party has a president for lifeâ€”only One Nation. When I was a member of One Nation and representing them in the Senate, I asked her to 'please explain' but she couldn't or wouldn't. Just like she couldn't explain why she breaks deals, and handshake deals at that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since it started contesting elections in 1996, the president for life, Jimmy and others have forced out 23 of 30 elected members of parliament, a strike rate of 77 per cent. Of those 30 elected members, six currently represent One Nation: two senators, three in the WA Legislative Council and one in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Two were disqualified from sitting in the Senate, Heather Hill and Malcolm Roberts. Rod Culleton resigned from the party before being disqualified from the Senate. Nineteen resigned in their first term. Two lasted a full term with the party before being defeated at the next election: Bill Flynn and Len Harris. Only one elected member has been re-elected for the party: Rosa Lee Long won Tablelands at the 2001 Queensland State election and was re-elected in 2004 and 2006, but as an Independent. No wonder One Nation has collapsed in the polls.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Today I want to speak about opportunities for water storage, water reticulation and water management, particularly in the northern part of our country, which receives more rainfall than any other part of Australia and, indeed, more rainfall than many parts of the world. Regrettably, there are all too few dams in the north. The last that I can recall being built in the north, and really anywhere in Australia, was the Fairbairn Dam at Emerald, which was built by a Liberal government back some decades ago. Then there's the Burdekin Dam near where I live, again initiated by the Fraser Liberal government some years ago. The Tinaroo Dam in the far north was a little time before that. But, since then, there has been very little activity on water storage and reticulation anywhere in my state of Queensland and not much across the Top End, apart from, of course, the outstanding example of the Ord River dam. Again that was an initiative of the Menzies government more than 50 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government federally, following its north Australia white paper initiatives, in developing northern Australia has been trying to get the Queensland state government interested in some water storage proposals in the north of the state. The drought that is gripping parts of south-west Queensland and western New South Wales these days shows the absolute necessity, urgency and critical nature of getting managed water facilities in our country where we have access to this huge rainfall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO have just completed major inquiries into three water storage proposals across the north of Australiaâ€”one at the Mitchell River, one around Darwin and one at the Fitzroy River in Western Australia. CSIRO, never known for the lightness of their workâ€”they always do everything in a very detailed fashionâ€”have spent some years, at federal government expense, I might say, investigating these three proposals. Just a couple of weeks ago they put out the results of their investigation and they are all very, very positive. I look forward to the Queensland government, who, of course, own the streams and riversâ€”they're the only ones that can do anythingâ€”reading these reports from CSIRO and doing something positive to harness, store, use and manage the water that is available in northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from these three sites across the north, there is a lot of other interest in water facilities. Pursuant to the coalition government's northern Australia white paper and the money that was allocated following it to water investigation proposals, the coalition government has instituted feasibility studies in relation to the Nullinga Dam west of Cairns, the Urannah Dam west of Bowen and just south of Ayr, where I live, the Cave Hill dam out near Cloncurry and the Mount Isa area and also the Big Rocks Weir on the Burdekin River near Charters Towers, which is part of the Hells Gates proposal north-west of Townsville. These feasibility studies have been funded by the Commonwealth government, with not a cent put into them by the Queensland government, I might say. The Hells Gates feasibility study, I understand, was made available to the Queensland government some months ago now, but it still hasn't been released publicly by the Queensland government. Why, you might ask, do the Queensland government have anything to do with it? They haven't put one cent into the Hells Gates proposal but regrettably, under our Constitution, as I said before, if it happens within streams, rivers or any water within the state then it is the constitutional responsibility of the Queensland government. So, regrettably, all of these proposals have to go to the Queensland government, who sit on them, no doubt working out how they can take some political advantage of initiatives that the Commonwealth have introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to also mention the Tully-Millstream proposals that were around quite a lot almost 30 years ago before they were shelved by a Labor government at the time. The Tully Falls comes off the Atherton Tablelands near Tully, just south of Cairns, and the water goes through the Koombooloomba Dam and then falls dramatically to the Kareeya power station, with a very small turbine at the end of it that's been operating for decades already. There were proposals to increase the activity in that Tully Hydro scheme and this would have given northern Australia and Northern Queensland, in particular, guaranteed baseload power from a renewable sourceâ€”waterâ€”with no carbon emissions whatsoever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course the Labor Party, because they are controlled by the Greens and exist in government in Queensland only because of Greens preferences, refuse to do anything about it. But there have been a number of proposals. The old Tully Millstream proposal has been updated, and a proposal was put forward by the then member for Hinchinbrook, Mr Andrew Cripps, who was a very effective member for Hinchinbrook in North Queensland and an excellent minister for natural resourcesâ€”probably the best Queensland's had in 20 or 30 years. He put forward a very detailed proposal for upgrading that old in-river hydro scheme. There is another proposal around, instituted by a number of dedicated North Queenslanders and a group called the Queensland Electricity Users Network, of which Ms Jennifer Brownie is the coordinator. They've looked at the old Tully Millstream proposal and have made calculations and done a lot of engineering work at their own expense on how the Tully Millstream could be converted into a pumped hydro scheme. It would involve a small location, a small collection pit, in the Tully River, at the bottom of the falls, where the water could be captured and then pumped up the hillâ€”again, at night-time, when there isn't such a big demand for electricityâ€”into Koombooloomba Dam and then released back down during the day, between 4 pm and 6 pm, when electricity use in the north is at astronomical levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately in the north now we have to rely on transmission lines from way down south. We're subject to monopoly control by a Queensland government-owned business entity that makes a squillion dollars out of users in the north, particularly business users, who are not subsidised. This Queensland government business entity makes a squillion dollars at the expense of people in the north, particularly businesses, and the Queensland government pockets the money, because they can't manage money; they're broke and they use the taxpayers, the electricity users, to address this. But this idea of a pumped hydro ticks all the boxes. It provides baseload power. It provides power that is renewable. It provides power that has no carbon emissions, if you're worried about those. It is cost-effective. And we are hoping that the federal governmentâ€”because the Queensland government won't do itâ€”might do a concept study into pumped hydro at Tully Millstream and, if that looks good, do a full feasibility study in the hope that when all this expert evidence comes out the Queensland government might at last ignore the Greens, who control them, and actually do something for water storage and for more-reliable electricity, particularly in the north of our state.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Last week I attended Incitec Pivot in Brisbane, which is a local manufacturing plant that employs about 200 local workers. I was there that day with the Leader of the Opposition, federal Labor leader Bill Shorten; our shadow minister Jason Clare; and our fantastic Labor candidate for Bonner, Jo Briskey. Incitec Pivot employs about 200 locals at that plant in Brisbane. They have plenty of other plants around Queensland and operations that employ almost 1,000 workers across the state. They're a very important part of our local economy. But it's been well publicised for a period of time that they have been really struggling with the high price of domestic gas in Australia, so much so that it is creating a lot of uncertainty for their workforce and for their future operations as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it was pleasing when we were there that day to be part of the announcement that federal Labor leader Bill Shorten made, the heart of which was basically ensuring that Australian energy needs are put first. This was really important for local manufacturing and was specifically why we made the announcement at Incitec Pivot in Brisbane. Effectively, the announcement we made is aimed at boosting local gas supply and putting downward pressure on prices, and all this is designed to protect Australian jobs at the same time, particularly those in manufacturing. As I mentioned, there were 200 workers there at Incitec Pivot, but we know that there are thousands and thousands of manufacturing jobs across Australia that depend on affordable and reliable gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's permanent gas export control trigger can be used when prices are too high, not just when there's a shortfall. There is a real contrast between the policy that Labor have put forward and what the piecemeal approach from those opposite has been in terms of their interest in gas. Labor will also boost supply for domestic use by introducing a national interest test for new LNG export facilities, and we will also give the ACCC new powers to monitor prices and crack down on anticompetitive behaviour. These are really important steps. Unlike those opposite, these steps tackle reliability but also tackle the price, which they haven't gone near. We also know that the resources minister admits that high gas prices are putting pressure on local manufacturing jobs, and this is a direct quote from him: 'I accept that prices of $10 are a great threat to jobs and manufacturing; prices of $8 are also a threat to jobs and manufacturing.' It was the resources minister himself, Matt Canavan, who said that. Unlike those opposite, who've talked about this, Labor has been prepared to take action, and we announced that at Incitec Pivot in Brisbane. Labor's plan will put downward pressure on gas prices. This will be a great result for Aussie manufacturers, for power generators and also, from a Labor point of view, for jobs and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the leadership on this policy issue of the Australian Workers' Union, particularly their national secretary, Dan Walton, and their Queensland secretary, Steve Baker, as well. Not only have they been advocating for their members, they've also been advocating for the broader community on this issue as well because they understand how important this is for Australian workers and for Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that Labor can only make announcements like this because we are stable, we are united and we have a leadership team who are listening to Australian families and Australian businesses and are prepared to announce policies that will work for those people. There's a clear contrast between what Labor have been presenting to the Australian people and what those opposite have been presenting. Let's look at this, because this mob have been in government for five years. They've been in government for five years, and what is their record on energy and electricity? We know they've had chaos and dysfunction and they've been able to come up with a coherent policy that they can unite their backbench on. We know their record after five years in government is that prices are up, pollution is up, reliability is down and policy uncertainty is playing havoc with the community. It's playing havoc with Australian families. It's playing havoc with Australian businesses, and it also is leading to a lack of new generation, and families are paying the price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, for almost a year, the previous Prime Minister and the previous energy minister worked on a policy called the National Energy Guarantee. They claimed that that policy was going to provide certainty. They claimed that that policy was going to reduce prices by $150 a year. Yet all they did was use that policy to undermine the former Prime Minister and knife him in the back. And what have they got since? They've actually got no policy. They've completely abandoned the National Energy Guarantee as a result. Do you know what their own modelling said? It said that, if we have no policy, it will lead to price increases of $300 over a decade. That is actually what we're seeing from the government. They've abandoned their policy. They've abandoned the National Energy Guarantee, which basically means that, with no policy, prices are going to go up by $300.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that they used this. The Turnbull hatersâ€”the Dutton supportersâ€”didn't care about Australian families. When they undermined the National Energy Guarantee, they just wanted to undermine the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. They didn't care about Australian families. They didn't care about the high cost that families are paying under this government. They were prepared to use that policy that they'd been working on for almost 12 months to undermine the Prime Minister and get rid of him. But let's look at the contrasting fortunes of the two architects of that policy. We know what they did when they knifed the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in the back. We know that part of it. But the second architect of that policy is the former minister Josh Frydenberg. And what did they do with him? They actually promoted him. Can you believe this? They worked on this policy for almost 12 months, and then they used it to knife one and promote the other. Energy policy under this government is an absolute farce!</span>

As I have tried to explain to the opposition once before: don't believe everything you read in the newspaper. This never happened. The Prime Minister has made very clear it never happened, and Mr Gutwein, the great Treasurer for the great state of Tasmania, has made clear it never happened. I am happy to quote from his statement:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just talk, though, about the reforms to the GST sharing arrangements that Mr Morrison, as Treasurer, put together. He was, of course, the architect of a reform that was in the too-hard basket for too long. Indeed, Mr Morrison has been able to deliver a better, fairer deal on the GST to Western Australia, in a way that is fair to every other state, including Tasmaniaâ€”indeed, in a way that leaves Tasmania $112 million better off.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see Senator Polley shaking her head. Well, I suggest to you that you take it up with your leader, because those are precisely the words that he used when he was in Western Australia. If you are saying to me that that's not true, I suggest you take that up with Mr Shortenâ€”unless you are now representing the Labor Party policy on the GST. Are you saying that the Labor Party is not on a unity ticket with the Liberal-National party on GST sharing arrangements? Now she's not telling me anything anymore.</span>

Indeed, the WA's share of the GST started to head to below 30c in the dollar under the period of the Rudd and Gillard governments. Prime Minister Gillard initiated the Brumby-Greiner review and then ignored the recommendations on how the system should be reformed.</span>

We are still waiting for Bill Shorten to clarify his position, because Senator Polley seems to think he doesn't support a fairer deal for WA.</span>

Under the coalition government, our investment in residential care places has increased each and every single year. Since our election in 2013 aged-care spending has increased by more than an additional billion dollars of extra support each and every year.

As we continue to fix this fiscal mess left by those opposite we can continue to make new investments. Just today the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aged Care announced an additional $106 million to support better facilities, better care and better standards for aged care. This includes an additional $16 million investment for the new national Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, which will be a one-stop shop to police the quality of services and to ensure better care and better standards in aged care. As the Prime Minister announced today, this will bolster the Commonwealth's ability to respond to wrongdoing and any risk to the provision of services to our senior Australians.</span>

That will be supported by this new investment and it's something that my colleagues and I in the National Party are very proud to have delivered. This will improve, maintain and expand infrastructure, ensuring older Australians in these locations receive the very same level of support that people receive in the cities.</span>

There has been no greater friend of senior Australians than the coalition government. We are delivering an additional 14,000 high-level home care packages over four years, which is on top of the 6,000 high-level packages already released last year. By 2021-22, more than 74,000 high-level home care packages will be available, which is an increase of 86 per cent since last year. At the same time, residential aged-care places continue to grow: $12.7 billion last year to more than $14.9 billion in 2012. That represents an average growth of 5.3 per cent per year.

The measures announced today are all about protecting seniors and making them safer. This is the first upgrade of aged-care standards in more than 20 years. Not only are we strengthening the standards but, importantly, we are supporting aged-care facilities to meet the new standards. This means 2,700 aged-care homes and 366,000 staff will get the training and support that they need to transition to the strengthened aged-care quality standards. This is part of the National-Liberal government's commitment ensuring the 1.3 million older Australians receiving aged care have support and confidence in the safety and quality of their care. This is how we care for, protect, respect and love our seniors.</span>

Does the minister agree with the video's assertion that farmers struggling to feed their cattle have 'gotto pay what they have got to pay'.</span>

But having toured drought-affected communities a lot over the last couple of months, there is a wide range of views on the ground in those communitiesâ€”whether it is in your home state of Queensland, which is 57 per cent drought declared, or New South Wales, which is 100 per cent drought declaredâ€”about how the farmers are being perceived. We know Australians right across this country have been incredibly generous, particularly those in the east coast capital cities, with financial support for our drought-affected farmers. Australians are donating at record levels to the Red Cross, to the CWA and to the National Farmers' Federation to ensure that those communities actually have the financial support that they need as they are going through this very, very difficult time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I am correctly interpreting your inference about what the people on the video are saying, some farmers who I speak to want to make sure that it is very clear that they are portrayed as strong, resilient small businessmen and women who are doing it tough and who are managing what is a situation of drought in this country. If you are a farmerâ€”say, up Quilpie wayâ€”you may have exceptionally dry years every three out of 10 years. If you are down in Victoria, that ratio is obviously a lot less. Whilst this outpouring of support is there and they appreciate it, they also want to remind the Australian public that they are resilient small businessmen and women.</span>

The TTP-11 allows global corporations to sue governments who make laws in the interests of their citizens and the environment under insidious ISDS clauses. It weakens protection of labour rights. It removes labour market testing and does not even mention climate change. This is a dud deal for Australia. It is a deal for corporations, not Australian workers or consumers. When will the government stop spinning and tell the Australian people the truth? This is a deal for their mates in big business and not a deal for the peopleâ€”</span>

This comment in the question that this is a 'dud deal' is purely commentary. It's an argument. It's this senator's opinion and it should not be allowed as a question. If she wants to debate it there is time for that later, but these are not questions and shouldn't be allowed, I suggest with respect.</span>

On this issue, I said I would come back to the chamber after I gave senators a chance to make submissions to me yesterday. I have received at least one. I'll be coming back to the chamber tomorrow. I urge all senators to read standing order 73, in the application of which there has been substantial slippage, which says that questions shall not contain arguments, inferences, imputations or epithets. Statements of facts can be used where they are strictly necessary to render the question intelligible. There is a habit of questions including more than is strictly necessary, and I will, in our next sitting session after I come back to the chamber, start to more strictly apply this provision.

I was actually waiting for Senator Hanson-Young's question, as opposed to her narrative. Nevertheless, it gives me a valuable opportunity to speak to the chamber in relation to the TPP-11, which is one of the most comprehensive trade deals ever concluded. In fact, it will eliminate 98 per cent of tariffs for 11 countries with a combined GDP of more than A$13.8 trillion and close to 500 million consumers. The big winners from this FTA are going to be Australian farmers, manufacturers, service providers, small businesses and all exporters because it's going to be easier for them to sell their goods and supply services in a free trade area that spans half the globe. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2017, almost one-quarter of Australia's total exports, which were worth $92 billion, went to the countries that are part of the TPP-11, and that is going to continue to grow as tariffs fall under the TPP-11. As Senator Birmingham referred to yesterday, modelling has been undertaken internationally by Brandeis International Business School and Johns Hopkins University that shows that Australia is forecast to see $15.6 billion in net annual benefits to national income by 2030. What the TPP-11 provides is improved access to markets where Australia already has FTAs, such as Japanâ€”for example, building on our existing bilateral FTA, including accelerated reductions on Japan's tariffs on beef and elimination of a range of Japan's cheese tariffs. It's also going to create Australia's first FTA with Canada and Mexico, giving Australian exporters preferential access to two of the world's top 20 economies for the first time. I would have thought that those in this chamber who support business, support small business, support manufacturers, support jobs, support farmers, support service providers and support exporters would recognise the value of this initiative andâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

That means that workers from the TPP-11 signatory countries  remain subject to and must satisfy any skills assessment required for the visa process. Workers from the signatory countries also remain subject to and must satisfy licensing and registration processes which are required by state and territory governments. </span>

In fact, we have welcomed the constructive approach by those opposite on matters of foreign affairs and matters of international trade, in engaging in a sensible discourse and a sensible discussion. In fact, the previous minister acknowledged that in his second reading speech in the House in August this year, in terms of his work with the shadow minister for trade.</span>

The government has a laser-like focus to reduce power prices. The No. 1 focus of the Minister for Energy is to reduce prices. Some successes have been made in the past year. Electricity prices in the wholesale market are down by 25 per cent. Gas spot prices are also down by around 20 to 25 per cent in the past year and a half. We have seen that flow through to the retail level in some contracts in different states across Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those reductions have come about from actions the government has taken. We have removed the ability of electricity companies to review regulatory decisions through the limited merits review process. That has helped save consumers $6Â½ billion on their electricity bills. We have, for the first time, introduced a control framework for gas exports to make sure that there is first sufficient gas for Australians before it is exported overseas. That has clearly helped relieve pressure in gas markets and contributed to that reduction in prices by around a quarter. This morning I met with gas producers to recommit to the heads of agreement we signed last year to ensure that uncontracted gas is first offered to Australian businesses to protect Australian jobs. That is a key focus of this governmentâ€”to support Australian jobs in our manufacturing sector.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more to do in response to the ACCC report that we commissioned last year. We are committing to introducing a safety net on prices for consumers. We are committing to ensuring that we have stronger competition laws, including the ability to break up electricity companies that continue to act in an anticompetitive way. And of course we support the investment in reliable full-time power, including coal and gas power. We don't shy away from using all our resources to bring people's power bills down.</span>

Over the last year, around 15 per cent of the jobs created in Australia were in the manufacturing sectorâ€”nearly 50,000 jobs. We're very proud of the fact that we have supported a strong employment market that is also helping to support a strong manufacturing sector. If we cannot turn around this energy situation, if we do not develop our resources and if we do not back the use of coal-fired power, gas-fired power and renewable powerâ€”all types of powerâ€”we will put those thousands of jobs at risk. We will put our heritage and tradition as a strong manufacturing nation at risk. We cannot conduct heavy manufacturing in this nation unless we use the fossil fuels of this nation to do that. Those on the other side are turning their backs on the workers in our coal-fired power stations and our gas-fired power stations. You'll never hear a word from them in defence of the hard work, effort and contribution that our electricity workers make in gas- and coal-fired power stations. We support them; they don't.</span>

In particular, the ballot we hope to conduct soon will be one factor we take into account in our decision-making but not the only factor, and that has always been my position and the government's position. I do not accept the characterisation you painted around the comments I made in this place last year. We have always been seeking broad community support. We certainly achieved that in the survey that was conducted in Hawker around the Wallerberdina Station last year, when support of that level was achieved. But the government is also of the view that a level of support around the 57 per cent level, which was achieved in Kimba early last year, is also indicative of quite broad community support, particularly on an issue that has been very fraught and fractious for our nation for four decades now.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I firmly believe, and the government firmly believes, that we need to find a long-term solution to store our nuclear waste, primarily produced by the world-class facility at Lucas Heights, which produces nuclear medicines that will help to improve the health of, on average, one out of every two Australians during their lifetime. We do need to find a long-term store for that. We're committed to doing that. However, we're also committed to making sure that running a grassroots program that ensures that any decision to place such a facility in a local community is a decision for that community. We will listen to their views through that process. We've been consulting extensively with those communities. The process for a ballot that we've put in place is one aspect of that consultation. We've had officials in Kimba and Hawker for the last year on a weekly basis. We have also conducted surveys with the neighbouring landowners. Obviously, their views are very important. Indigenous stakeholders are extremely important as well. All of these views will be factored into a government decision later this year. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

I maintain that the government has been incredibly up-front and open through this process. As I explained in Kimba and Hawker when I was there around a month ago, any decision that I make as the minister under the National Radioactive Waste Management Act will result in legislative changes to that act. That will, of course, come back to this parliament, so that will be an additional step of accountability and review for that decision-making process. But the government and myselfâ€”one of many ministers who's had responsibility for this actâ€”are simply conducting our responsibilities under the legislative authority that's been given to us by the National Radioactive Waste Management Act, passed, I think, in 2012.</span>

If I could just quickly cover off on Senator Smith's home state, where the rollout is full steam ahead: over 80 per cent of premises in Western Australia are able to connect to the network and over half a million premises in WA have an active service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November last year, the ACCC announced a comprehensive inquiry into wholesale service standards to improve customer experience of the NBN. As a result of those 11 months of work, I'm pleased to advise colleagues that the NBN has, this week, signed an undertaking to pay financial penalties for anything less than a 100 per cent performance in relation to NBN connections, fault rectifications or missed appointments. This means that if your NBN connection doesn't work, if your service is not rectified properly or if an NBN contractor misses an appointment, the NBN will pay. Under section 87B of the Competition and Consumer Act, the NBN will pay the fines as rebates to retailers, who must take reasonable steps to pass these rebates on to businesses and families using the NBN.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, there is no such thing as a 100 per cent fault-free service. Things will still, from time to time, not be all that we would hope that they would be. But if we're to achieve world's best practice we must set the bar high, and today's announcement does that. In addition, the NBN has also undertaken to commence regular public reporting on the rates of congestion within its fixed wireless network.</span>

Under our government, the NBN connects that many customers every two weeks and, according to independent experts, the experience is overwhelmingly good. In March, the ACCC's Rod Sims said that speed delivery was 'better than expected' and that this goes:</span>

NBN is on track to be cash flow positive. Revenue grew to $2 billion in 2017-18 and is forecast to extend to $5 billion per year from 2021. New pricing has ended fixed line congestion and helped consumers take up higher-speed services. There are 47 per cent of consumers who are now on 50 megabit per second plans or faster. By the end of 2020, 8.1 million homes and businesses will be connected. Investments in consumer experience have driven better services and fewer faults. What this means, practically, for many Australians is that there will be Netflix without buffering, small regional businesses linked to the global economy and remote communities connected digitally to city services. That's the experience that the government is delivering.</span>

As I'm sure this chamber is aware, the Paris Agreement is a collective response to the global threat of climate change. It has been signed by a number of countries, including China. China's commitment under the agreement is to reduce its emissions intensity as an economy by 60 to 65 per cent of 2005 levels. The advice I have is that China does not have official projections of their 2030 emissions, so I'm unable to provide a specific answer to Senator Leyonhjelm's question. China is, however, one of the largest investors in renewable energy in the world, committing, I think, $130 billion to clean energy technologies, and it is responsible for over half of solar installations in the world. Of course, China is experiencing above average economic growth, which is a good thing for the world. That does, of course, also mean it has growth in emissions and reflects why its commitment is in terms of emissions intensity, not as an absolute number or level of emissions.</span>

Similarly, like China, its commitment is in terms of emissions intensity, at 33 to 35 per cent of its 2005 levels. Like China, India is growing very strongly. In fact, I believe it is the fastest-growing major economy in the world at the moment. So, as it grows and, hopefully, moves to the category of developed nations, its emissions will increase, as will its commitments in terms of its percentage of emissions per economic output, not in terms of absolute number of emissions like Australia.</span>

I listened to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this morning doing media on Radio National and on Sky. She certainly made some observations on Radio National about experiences that she has had. Nobody wants to see in this parliament the sort of behaviour that's been described. I have indicated myself that I've agreed with that. I've seen both sides of the chamber and other parts of the parliament deal with these issues over a long period of time. It's not appropriate in any workplace. It is not appropriate here. </span>

The government is working very hard to ensure that workers are helped to keep more of their own hard-earned money. We have provided tax relief to 10 million people already, and there is more to come in that regard. The net result is that the money is where it belongs: in workers' pockets. The government is also helping small businesses to grow, to invest, to hire more staff and to pay more wages by cutting taxes for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. Just today a bill to further extend the small business instant asset write-off measure passed through the Senate, meaning that small businesses can continue to access the red tape reduction and the cashflow boost that come with being able to write off assets of up to $20,000.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a very important consequence of the government's strong economic plan, and that is jobs. A job means opportunities. It means fulfilment and it means financial security. As we know, this government has been deliveringâ€”more than 400,000 jobs created in 2017, which was a record, and around 340,000 jobs created in the 2017-18 financial year, which was the largest financial year increase in more than a decade. And there are more young people at work, over 95,000 of them finding employment in the 2017-18 year alone. That is the best result in almost 30 years. This government is committed to protecting and supporting workers and small business, and we'll continue to lay a platform that allows the economy to prosper and that gets more Australians into more jobs.</span>

We know that employer associations and unions in particular have a privileged position in the industrial relations system and that their members place a great deal of trust in them. But lawless behaviour by some of these organisations and their officials not only harms their members but also harms small business and the economy. The government's ensuring-integrity bill is before the Senate right now, and it's crucial to making sure that small business and workers are protected from that sort of behaviour, including by those in unions who might take the law into their own hands. There are, of course, some that we're very familiar with, and we include unions like the CFMMEU in that. They are poster boys for that sort of behaviour. To date they've accumulated around $1,600 million in court-ordered penalties for breaking the law, but that doesn't seem to be a deterrentâ€”it's only members' fees, after allâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Of course the volume goes up on the other side, because they don't like to hear this. They don't support the government's reforms because they are completely beholden to those who are their mates in the union movement, particularly the CFMEU. In fact, what they should do, if they were sensible, and given what's already on the public record, is disavow the CFMEU. They should welcome the opportunity that the integrity legislation will give them to get rid of the bad eggs who spoil the union movement for good workers. That's what the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2017 would do. But they can't do that, because they're under the union's thumb. The Leader of the Opposition needs their support and needs their leadership votes. He continues to benefit from their millions of dollars in donations. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

He will continue to work with all of the members of his team to ensure that we continue to make Australia stronger, keep the Australian economy strong, keep Australians safe and keep Australians together.

But he hasn't denied that there was some sort of robust discussion, nor has he denied that the former Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, had to step in and negotiate with the Tasmanian Treasurer and the Tasmanian Premier. What we've seen today with the statement from Minister Gutwein, the Tasmanian Treasurer, is that the best he can say about the GST deal is that, on face value, it is a good one for Tasmania. The deal was announced months ago, but Peter Gutwein apparently hasn't seen the detail.</span>

We know that the Tasmanian Premier and the Tasmanian Treasurer have an issue with this government through Prime Minister Morrison. It was there when he was the Treasurer.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  The people of Tasmania have been exceptionally well served by the coalition government, especially in recent years. The track record speaks for itself: the irrigation schemes that are currently being built in Tasmania, the Midland Highway upgrade, the Hobart Airport upgrade, the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme for our exports and so the list goes on. The falsehood, and one has to assume now given the overwhelming public evidence, the deliberate falsehood of seeking to peddle that our schools and hospitals have been cut is simply unsustainable. The facts speak for themselves. There have been considerable increases in funding in both the health and education sectors. It is absolutely clear, and on the record, in each and every budget that the coalition has delivered over the past five years. And yet the Australian Labor Party will continue to come in here and go to the public seeking to peddle a tissue of lies to try to scare people. They did it successfully, I must confess, at the last election with their 'Mediscare' campaign. Completely false, completely untrue and one wonders how they sleep at night knowing that they have gained seats through the peddling of misinformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How unself-aware can a senator be when a Labor Senator, such as Senator Carol Brown, gets up and says that supposedly some of us are more concerned about other issues when all she had to do was look over her left shoulder and look at the demise of her Tasmanian Labor Senate colleague Senator Singh. And who controls the division of the Tasmanian Labor Party? None other than Senator Carol Brown and her friends. Good luck to her. That is the nature of politics. It is a tough game, but, please don't come in here and assert things when you yourself, Senator Brown, have been engaged in such machinations that have seen the demotion of Senator Lisa Singh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what the Labor Party want me and the coalition to concentrate on, the petty politics. What we on this side are concentrating on is success for Tasmania, courtesy of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team, the Tasmanian Liberal government and the commitment of the ministry to all things Tasmanian. That is why the GST deal that was gained for Tasmania will see the delivery of an extra $100-plus million to my home state. Unlike the Australian Labor Party leader, who goes to Western Australia and says, 'You have been dudded. We will give you more,' and then comes to Tasmania and asserts, 'I will give Tasmania just as much as ever before.' The GST isn't a magic puddling. If somebody gets more somebody else has to get less. That is where the numbers never stack up for the Australian Labor Party. That's why they always run deficits and that's why they always increase debt, because they do not have the capacity or the honesty to level with the Australian people and say, 'If somebody gets more money, it may well mean that somebody else gets less money.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, Treasurer Morrison and the finance minister were able to negotiate and develop a GST deal that, in fact, sees the state of Tasmania over $100 million better off. And somehow that is a failure on my part?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, if an extra $100 million for the state of Tasmania is a failure, I will wear that failure just as much as when we got the extra money for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, the Hobart airport, the irrigation scheme, the Midland Highway and the jobs and investment packages. If they are all failures, I will wear them as failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great news is that, since we got into government, the unemployment rate has gone from 8.1 per cent to below six per cent. That is the good economic news. But even better than the economic news is the social news that there are now thousands of extra Tasmanians in gainful employment because of the policies of the federal and state Liberal governments, working together to ensure that that abysmal record of unemployment is wiped off the slate of Tasmania. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  Today in question time there was, I would say, an almost deceitful attempt to get away from the truth in the minister's answers in regard to the questions we were asking on the GST issues. The Prime Minister's behaviour reported this morning is a slur on every Tasmanian, and Mr Morrison really should apologise. He's taking Tasmanians for granted. Just because he's got no federal members from there in the House of Representatives doesn't mean he should ignore us or treat us as any less. It certainly doesn't mean that he should be rude about it. Whether the actual potty-mouthed comments were said or not, he did say that we were a 'mendicant' state and he really should take that back. That is implying that we are just beggars. We have the right to make sure that the people of Tasmania are looked after, and the Liberal senators on that side of the chamber should be doing just that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison is completely out of touch, and his smugness is going to be the downfall of him. Let me just say this: he is not listening to the people of Tasmania at all. He will end up without any House of Representatives members from Tasmania yet again at the next election. That's my prediction. The people of Tasmania don't like to be (a) insulted and (b) taken as mugs. In regard to the GST issue, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the Tasmanian Treasurer, Peter Gutwein, clearly disagreed over the dud GST deal, and what it's exposed to us are great divisions in the Liberal Party. It's clear that Peter Gutwein believed the GST deal was defective in some way and that there was something not right with it, but what is also clear is that Premier Hodgman rolled over and signed up anyway. Today's Hobart <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> newspaper reported:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">MALCOLM Turnbull was forced to sideline Scott Morrison in critical GST negotiations after his then treasurer allegedly abused his Tasmanian counterpart Peter Gutwein in an expletive-laden tirade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Mercury understands the Tasmanian Liberals were still so concerned about Mr Morrison's attitude towards their state during negotiations that they asked their counterparts in Canberra to counsel Mr Morrison before he did media here following the deal being done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an amazing assessment of Mr Morrison's shortcomings as Treasurer. It's a stark example of why he shouldn't be Prime Minister. We haven't actually heard why he should be Prime Minister. We haven't actually heard why Prime Minister Turnbull was rolled. We can't get any answers out of anyone on those things. As for Mr Morrison telling people to just get on with it, we are not going to just get on with it. We want some answers. We want to know why it all happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But while Mr Morrison might deny the language that he used, it's very clear, as I said, that his attitude to Tasmania and to Tasmanians is problematical. It's very problematical. It's notable that the Tasmanian Liberal Treasurer is, as I said, yet to deny the Prime Minister was sidelined from GST discussions because of his conduct. So Mr Gutwein hasn't come out and said, 'No, that didn't happen.' Mr Morrison is out of touch, he's smug and he's condescending. I don't think, in general, people like that. He might think he's being a leader, but most of us think he's just playing a bit of a game. He was the last man standing after many, many iterations through that week. And no-one voted for Mr Morrison or his illegitimate government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Tasmanians feel that the economy isn't working for them. They talk to us all the time. The people are worried about passing on a worse deal to their kids. This is the first generation where that has started to happen. In previous generations people have been able to pass on to their kids better deals than they had themselves. Well, this is no longer happening, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Mr Morrison and the Libs have spent five years cutting the essential services that working Tasmanians rely on while giving tax handouts to the top end of town. Let's look at just how much Mr Morrison actually cares about Tasmania. When he was the Treasurer he visited Tasmania onceâ€”just once. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  On the question of the GST, I am very proud to rise to contribute to this debate as a Victorian senator, because it is indeed Victoria that can stand very proud and tall as one of the states in the federation that has been a net contributor to the federation since Federation. In fact, casting my eyes around the chamber right now, I believe that I and Senator Hume and you, Mr President, and Senator Fifield are the only senators in the chamber at this very moment who can proudly say that they represent a state that has been a net contributor to the federation since Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bilyk is most unkind to her fellow Tasmanians. On my recent trips to Tasmania for the by-election, to support the great Brett Whiteley for Tasmania's state election, what I observed from Tasmaniaâ€”and I know Senator Cameron is a frequent and fond visitor to Tasmania alsoâ€”is that Tasmania is booming. And it is no wonder that Tasmania is booming, under the twin leadership of a coalition government here in Canberra and the outstanding leadership of the Hodgman government in Tasmania. Tasmania's doing well because it's got a good state government that is focused on free enterprise, jobs and economic growth, not on environmental radicalism or locking up the state. Tasmania is doing well because it's got a federal government that is focused on the economy, jobs and prosperity and  a federal government that is supportive of Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have here in this chamber a very dedicated, very eloquent and very passionate team of Tasmanian coalition senators who work very hard every day to ensure that their state's interests are well protected. We have my friend Senator Duniam. We have Senator Abetz, who made a contribution to this debate earlier; Senator Bushby, our Chief Government Whip; Senator Colbeck, the only frontbencher from Tasmania; and of course our most recent new addition, Senator Martin, our new Nationals colleague from Tasmania. They are a strong, united team and they're effective at advocating for Tasmania. The evidence is clear for all to seeâ€”and not just in the new GST distribution, although that is a very important recent edition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate seeks to impugn the integrity, the motives and the contribution of our Prime Minister. But it was of course our Prime Minister who, not that long ago, as Treasurer, devised a solution to the GST distribution problem that had eluded all previous governments. This is not a new problem, but it is a problem that this government and Prime Minister Morrison, as Treasurer, took head-on and addressed. And he addressed it in such a way thatâ€”yesâ€”dealt with the very valid concerns of my Western Australian colleagues, who have been for years raising the problems of the GST distribution and the way in which their state has been disadvantaged. It effectively dealt with their concerns but did so without taking anything at all away from any other state.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a table here, published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Review</span> in July this year, which summarises the boost of the GST distribution pool by state out to 2026-27, the time period over which the solution is proposed. This is how each state fares under that solution: $351 million of net benefit to New South Wales; $425 million of benefit to Victoria; $518 million of benefit to Queensland; $3.3 billion of benefit to Western Australia; $257 million of benefit to South Australia; and $112 million of benefit to Tasmania. There is even $46 million of benefit going to the ACT, and there is $189 million of benefit going to the Northern Territory. So every state and every territory, from Tasmania to Western Australia included, will be better off under the GST distribution solution devised by our former Treasurer and now Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. He has been very unfairly maligned in this debate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also unfairly maligned is the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team. Not only have they secured a strong GST deal for their state; they have secured a range of other generous supports for Tasmania, which, in the 2018-19 budget, amounted to $3.8 billion. That included, of course, the GST disbursements to the state of $2Â½ billion but also specific-purpose funding of $1.3 billion; record funding for schools of $446 million, which is an increase of $7.2 million since the last budget; and record infrastructure funding of $142 million, which is an increase of $27.3 million since the last budget. Tasmania is doing well and Australia is doing well under this Prime Minister. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M0R" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  The revelation today of a clear disagreement between the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, during his time as Treasurer, and the Tasmanian Treasurer, Peter Gutwein, over the dud GST deal for Tasmania has once again exposed the out-of-control divisions within the Liberal Party. We all saw that on display only a fortnight ago, but now, through a leak, we have again seen an incredible division between the Tasmanian Liberals at the state level and this new Prime Minister and the federal Liberals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean for the future of Tasmania? What does it mean when we have a Tasmanian government that does not get along with its federal counterparts and, in fact, when it does not get along with this Prime Minister? There are real concerns now about what this whole affair means for a number of Tasmania's vital services. What does it mean for the City Deal, what does it mean for Macquarie Point, what does it mean for essential services like our health and hospital crisis when we have a Prime Minister who has shown such contempt for Tasmania? All Tasmanians today would have woken up incredibly worried by the fact that we have, as leaked in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span>, a Prime Minister who has shown his complete contempt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this dud deal that the state Liberals rolled over for was not bad enough, it's now clear we have a Prime Minister who does not care about Tasmania as a state. To allegedly refer to our state as 'mendicant' is just absolutely abhorrent. We all know that this refers to a telephone call that occurred between the now Prime Minister and the state Treasurer, Peter Gutwein. Prime Minister Morrison, who was then Treasurer, indicated that Tasmanians are, in effect, beggarsâ€”that we are, in effect, beggars. It is absolutely abhorrent for the Prime Minister of this country to refer to Tasmania as beggars. It tells us what this Prime Minister thinks of us, what he thinks of Tasmanians, behind closed doors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what he thinks of Tasmanians, because he has been to Tasmania only four times in the past 10 years, and one of those times was during the recent Braddon by-electionâ€”once in this term of government and in his time as Treasurer. I think that says it all. For the Prime Minister to refer to Tasmanians as beggars is deeply offensive. It also proves exactly what has always been suspected, which is that this GST deal was designed for Western Australia at the expense of Tasmania. No Tasmanian has ever been fooled by that. It has been a dud deal since day one; it has been a dud deal since then. But then again 'how dud?' we don't know, because the Treasurer of Tasmania himself has said that he has taken it on face value. He has taken this deal on face valueâ€”a deal that has an effect on Tasmania's bottom line, Tasmania's budget, and how we deliver our services. He said months ago that he still hadn't seen the detail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There goes the relationship. That shows you how close the relationship is between the Tasmanian Treasurer and the then federal Treasurer, now Prime Minister. It does not bode well for the future of Tasmania under this state Liberal government, and it does not bode well for the future of Tasmania under this federal coalition government under Scott Morrison. The sooner there is an election in this country, the better. And the sooner we vote this joke of a government out of this country, the betterâ€”so that states like Tasmania can get a decent government that cares about all Australians, including Tasmanians; so that Tasmanians do get their fair share of the GST; so that we can be respected; and so that we can deliver the services that Tasmanians expect. The title 'beggar' used by this Prime Minister is absolutely offensive.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator REYNOLDS:</span>
                </a>  On 23 August this year, I rose in the Senate to address my concerns about the behaviour of some in parliament during our leadership challenges. My speech then was in response to questions without notice by members of the opposition at question time that day. Despite significant discussion in this chamber and in the media, I stand by my comments on that day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I did comment publicly for the first and last time on these stories of bullying and intimidation which continue to be aired, sadly, by Labor women in this chamber and also by the media. A number of my colleagues have also addressed these issuesâ€”very senior colleagues in my party. The Australian people have made it abundantly clear to me and, I'm sure, to all people in this chamber that they are sick and tired of hearing politicians talk about themselves. I share their sentiments. I strongly believe that the correct forum to address these concerns is via robust and constructive discussion within the Liberal parliamentary party processes, not in the media and not in this chamber. I am very confident and very comfortable that the Prime Minister and our whips are taking the appropriate action in this process, which, again, I firmly believe is something that is best dealt with internally, because (1) the Australian people deserve better and (2) if we are to seek genuine outcomes, like in any other organisation, we need to deal with these matters ourselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly honoured to have been appointed as the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs in the Morrison government. Over the past two weeks my focus has been on my new responsibilities and seeing firsthand the amazing work that the men and women of the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Border Force and Emergency Management Australia have been doing. These men and women, many of whom are serving the nation in uniform, are serving with distinction. They are securing our borders; they are keeping Australians safe, and they are ensuring that, as a nation, we are well prepared for a challenging upcoming emergency-management season. The last thing those men and women need is their ministers sitting there, in the public, talking about themselves and not addressing the important issues that they are dealing with.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it was extremely disappointing to see the Labor Party again making very cheap political capital out of this issue in this chamber, criticising the way that we, as Liberal Party women, choose to deal with this issue and exploiting it in this chamber. What my colleagues and I are doing is exactly what we have done in relation to the Labor Party. When the Labor Party has exhibited appalling behaviour towards people on my side of the chamber, we haven't done what those opposite have been doing in this chamber today and to Minister Nash last year. When these issues have arisen on occasion, in terms of bad behaviour by those opposite, on our sideâ€”I certainly have not ever publicised the issues or brought them into the political arena here in this chamber. In fact, sitting here today and listening to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, I was incredibly disappointed because, when issues have happened and she has had cause to apologise to me and others for the behaviour of her team, we have dealt with it privately, not publicly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When it has been public, Senator Cameron, we have discussed it publicly but we have not brought it into this chamber. I firmly believe that in politics in this chamber and in any organisation in Australia, if we are truly to deal with the issues faced by many women in the workplace then cheapening them through theatrical politics here in question time doesn't assist the women in my party, doesn't assist the women in this chamber and it certainly does not assist the women in any workplace in this country. This is the last time I will be discussing this publicly. I want to make it very clear that it is not because I am giving up the fight; it is because I believe the appropriate way to do that, to get meaningful change, is within my party. Those opposite, I would ask and I would plead: if you want to see a better future for women in this chamber, stop politicising it and making it even harder for us on this side to deal with it. Thank you, Mr President.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme 'BSPVES' is now unnecessarily perpetuating the single greatest barrier for Tasmania limiting the growth of population, investment and jobs.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The scheme and associated measures were intended to remove this barrier by making Bass Strait 'a part of the National Highway'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Bass Strait is already more than adequately federally funded.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 1996, the 'BSPVES' was introduced following a public campaign for Bass Strait transport equality.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2001-2 a major change was made, destroying the original intention of the scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Your petitioner Peter Brohier, asks that the Senate, call on the Prime Minister to use his best endeavors to restore the original purpose by causing Bass Strait passenger ferry fares to be brought into line with the cost of land-based National Highway travel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A lowering of Bass Strait passenger fares to the cost of highway travel would extend the Hume Highway to Hobart and work a social an economic miracle across two states.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This huge interstate, inter-capital infrastructure link can connect our nation in days, without even one kilometer of highway needed.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is every resource, including sea highway policy, unused shipping capacity and federal funding, in place now to restore equalisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given the history of Bass Strait ferry transport over the last two decades, it seems unlikely, without further Federal intervention, that a ferry service will ever move people at highway equivalence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current skewed access reduces the passenger vehicle ratio, acts against a volume service and uses the BSPVES inefficiently when compared with highway equivalence. This approach hinders the growth of many of the largest sectors of the Tasmanian economy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Petition PN 0352 House of Representatives and the Ministerial Response tabled on the 20th August 2018 and appearing in Hansard are relevant.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ministerial response confirms that under the 'BSPVES', the intention of providing highway equalisation for people movement to and from Tasmania by sea was abandoned in 2002.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition's announcement in 2001-2 indicated an intention to expand the equalisation scheme, not to destroy it. The Ministerial response confirms that despite this, the BSPVES scheme continued to maintain the word 'equalisation' in its title.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whilst the funding mechanism changed from 'highway equivalence' to CPI, the equalisation intention of the BSPVES need not have changed . It did.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, the apparent intent of filling ferries in winter was the change in objective that destroyed equalisation. This is even questionable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ministerial response refers to substantial federal funding under the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme 'TFES' and the BSPVES. These</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">schemes are said to be now aimed at lowering the cost of transport for both freight and people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The response failed to acknowledge that a competitive market for freight under the 1976 TFES brings the freight cost to shippers down. The same does not seem to be the case for people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Using the BSPVES to value add to travel or meet the needs of those seeking leisure holidays in Tasmania may satisfy the needs of a relatively small accommodation sector. This seems to be the overriding priority of sea travel rather than low fares.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the BSPVES the cost of travel continues to be set by a single operator, hourly or daily, at any level it chooses. Vital and expected sea based competition has not arisen.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">After 2002, 'equalisation' should have been maintained, in the absence of competition, by a community service obligation imposed on the BSPVES and or, by placing a condition on the use of the BSPVES by only ferry operators willing to maintain sufficient equalized fares as are necessary on such a critical route.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our nation doesn't destroy other interstate, inter-capital highways within a few years of their inception to meet the needs of a connecting ferry or punt, or a few special interest groups in one state. Why do so here? Why announce an expansion of the equalisation scheme, then remove an equalisation formula from Ministerial directives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I was chairman of the original National Sea Highway Committee 'NSHC'. Without that committee, and its predecessor, the Committee for Bass Strait Transport Equality, which I also chaired, there would be no BSPVES. These committees started in the mid to early 1990's.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NSHC was possibly the most influential committee of the time. It represented many major interests across Tasmania, and on the mainland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The vision and aims of these committees should not now be overridden.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The BSPVES funding was always uncapped and demand driven. It continues to this day . It was a serious amount of money necessary for closing the gap in an interstate transport link.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It was accompanied by written policy created by the Coalition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The BSPVES was not about replacing underutilized shipping by the purchase of even more new ferries, value adding to trips, offering a free or reduced priced transportation of the shell of a car, prioritizing the needs of ferry operators over highway travel, supporting seasonal fare variation, stressing the importance of one-way visitation, providing leisure holidays with a car, increasing costs of transport, promoting longer holidays in just Tasmania, largely ignoring the impact on Victoria, ignoring the world definition of tourism when monitoring the impact of the BSPVES, and largely ignoring the need for and importance of two way A to B t ravel, protecting air services when air and surface transport compete against all other interstate routes and when surface travel is necessary for expanding the market for air, or for supporting football clubs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some of these outcomes may be necessary to boost an accommodation sector in Tasmania . They are not appropriate for a link connecting two broad- based state economies where most of the Gross State Product is derived from a variety of people related activities, not just from an accommodation sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In Tasmania's case, the trickledown impact from the accommodation sector is far too small to drive a whole economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It seems the Ministerial response has been written with little or no knowledge of the Coalition promises in 1996 and history, showing the extent of the support for equalisation across the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It took a lot of effort to have the BSPVES introduced. The change made in 2001-2 was not similarly fought for, or supported.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From my experience, the Coalition parties or the nation would never have supported such a change in 1996, or in 2001-2, or even now, without the Commonwealth funding every remote tourist region, regardless of being separated by mountains, water or desert.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Certain, consistently priced, sea highway access for and to people is critical to our nation. Also for many people related activities across South Eastern Australia. Why destroy it?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The move away from interstate highway equalisation is doing major damage to large economies. Trillions are invested along the Hume corridor that could more effectively be used. Why allow a 'punt' operator to govern the use of such an important corridor.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is critical that the BSPVES be run to transport people, in both directions, at least as effectively as TFES is run for freight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is an ongoing case for applying the BSPVES in a way that delivers a major interstate, national infrastructure transport link, as originally intended.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ways of meeting other objectives relating to one-way targeted leisure holidays with a car, and largely unrelated to basic transport, should not continue to prevail without an interstate transport scheme first being established.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">'Geographical' and, so called 'unique challenges for Tasmania' referred to in the Minister's response, many caused by lacking an interstate road or rail link, are able to be largely overcome by a ferry service operating as part of the National Highway.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ferries operate as highways across the world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this context, Tasmania is no more unique than other regions - it's how Canberra treats access that separates our nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The link, based on equalization, should be fixed first, before considering any need for special subsidies for Tasmania. Highway equalisation schemes are not subsidies. The BSPVES campaign was also not a grab for subsidies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The BSPVES was to deliver 'equalisation' based on equity and transport equality. It was directed at removing or minimizing any claim of disadvantage. The main benefit should flow to the traveller.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Canberra has not met its obligations to the nation, as promised by the Coalition, nor acted consistently with the intent of federation, of 'linking the colonies' into a 'national integrated economy through the movement of both people and freight'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">BSPVES monitoring has been too narrow. It has largely ignored an assessment of regular A to B highway travel, in both directions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With an intended offer by Prime Minister Howard of $50 foot passenger fares, rejected in 2001, it seems unlikely that the changes in 2001-2 could really reduce passenger fares and fill ferries?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Equalisation is and was the cornerstone of the Coalition platform in 1996. It works for freight, why not for the movement of people to connect two large service based economies?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The BSPVES should not be seen as a gravy train for special interests, over the national interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The campaign for Bass Strait transport equality was a people initiated campaign for national transport equity- why erode faith in democracy and continue to separate our nation? Why destroy a link that can boost the economy and impact positively on all Australians and many of our businesses on both sides of Bass Strait?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is time some in Canberra respected the wishes of the people and supported the Coalition's well documented equalisation policy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The decision made in 2001-2, possibly mainly on the run, was one that took little account of its ramifications across South Eastern Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It seems pointless to continue to try to support the 2001-2 policy setting against the reasons for a sea highway connection.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ministerial response seems to dismiss the accuracy of the view that 'a campaign for Bass Strait interstate transport equality, supported by business in two states, has failed to deliver despite resulting in massive federal funding'. Well, a more comprehensive knowledge of history may prove this opinion correct. The national conference resolutions of the time of both Coalition parties should also be noted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Who or what is influencing policy relating to Bass Strait, and why? Why is history being ignored? Governance in this case seems far from transparent. I suggest that the claim made in the fourth paragraph of the Ministerial response be compared with the 1996 Tasmania Package documentation, if the claim is doubted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Passenger fares, set by a single operator, at a level of its own choosing, with perhaps more targeted value added objectives can hardly be said to be even likely to meaningfully reduce passenger fares when fares vary daily and there seems no effective benchmark.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is time Tasmania recognized the gift that the writer, the original Committee for Bass Strait Transport equality, the National Sea Highway Committee, its supporters and Prime Ministers on both sides of politics gave to Tasmania in 1996. It was a full opportunity for Tasmania to be connected, as all other states. This gift should be valued, respected, used and not trashed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Canberra needs to urgently hear the ongoing voice of those located in Tasmania still calling for transport equity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The denial of fair interstate access is very serious. The solution is so very simple. It is time to improve the effectiveness of our democracy and economy, not erode it. Policies that favour one industry on one side of Bass Strait should not govern the only vital surface artery between two states and the artery between the two main islands of Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The BSPVES was aimed at turning a water barrier into a vital Bass Strait connecting link. Transport across it needs to mesh with a National transport strategy, road infrastructure connectivity, and integrate the use of cross border assets. It is also vital for maintaining critical mass, the spreading of overheads, lowering prices, and increasing service delivery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Without Canberra acting, Tasmanians now have no chance of being connected to the rest of the nation' s transport grid. Their main highway goes to nowhere. They are now to be denied affordable access to family and friends on the mainland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Core promises to those in the Apple Isle have now become meaningless whilst the fruits of the people's labour have been denied them and given to others. What sort of impression does this give of fairness and the governance process?</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The people should be given the National Highway they voted for.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We, and our then supporters, including TI Line, had great expectations that a sea based National Highway connection would have a dramatic impact on numbers crossing positively impacting on the 'economy of many regions of South Eastern Australia'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a>  The concept of a military covenant has its origins in the British Armed Forces 2011, and it's great to see the Labor policy announcement, which will see something similar enshrined should they take government. However, this issue is too important to be simply the policy of one side of politics. We need the current government to accept the wisdom of this policy and take action now. In essence, the military covenant is an acceptance by everyone that the preparedness of our military people to sacrifice themselves for our nation requires in return our nation to accept responsibility for the veterans after their service is complete. It is only just that those who risk life and limb to allow us to sleep safe in our beds are looked after by us after their service and not abandoned to fall victim to their wounds, whether physical or psychological. It is appropriate therefore that such a covenant be enshrined in legislation. With this notice of motion, I call on all sides of politics to demonstrate multipartisan support. </span>

Labor has committed to signing Australia's first military covenant, recognising the immense commitment our Defence Force personnel make to serve their country, and to formalising our nation's commitment to look after those who have sacrificed for our nation. Australia has a proud military history and, as such, we have an obligation to all those who have served in the name of our nation and our freedoms. Labor's announcement of a military covenant is a testament of our commitment to those who are serving or have served our country. </span>

                  </a>  Support for our current and former Defence Force personnel and families is above politics. Many senators have spoken in the past about the need to more formally recognise the unique nature of military service. Indeed, I have repeatedly advocated for a legislated covenant since my first speech in 2014. I also wrote to all members of parliament and senators later that year, asking for multiparty support. Over the last four years, this issue has been driven forward by ex-service organisations, veterans and their families. A covenant is now supported by the Returned and Services League, the Defence Force Welfare Association, Legacy, the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations, and other groups and individuals. It is also the policy of Queensland's Liberal National Party. I welcome the growing support from across the chamber for a covenant to be established. We owe it to those who have served to get it done. </span>

                  </a>  Quite simply, I denied leave to insert the word 'clean' because that would effectively shut down the electricity industry in South Australia. The Labor government in South Australia purchased a whole bunch of diesel generators to keep the lights on. Senator Patrick may not care about the electricity supply in South Australia, but I do. I believe South Australians deserve electricity day and night. If that means keeping those diesel generators running until we can get a decent coal-fired power station, a gas-fired power station, a nuclear power station or something else that is reliable, I will stand condemned. But I will always fight for the rights of pensioners and businesses in South Australia to have their lights on.</span>

                  </a>  The comprehensive and progressive agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP-11, is one of the most comprehensive trade deals concluded and will eliminate more than 98 per cent of tariffs for 11 countries with a combined GDP of more than $13 trillion and close to 500 million consumers. The TPP has been widely welcomed by industry. New modelling undertaken by economists indicates that Australia is forecast to see $15.6 billion in annual benefits to national income by 2030. This boost to our nation's income means more jobs, higher wages and greater investment into further areas of business and jobs growth.</span>

                  </a>  I note with interest that Labor has announced new measures to protect workers and national sovereignty in future trade deals and to improve the transparency of agreements by parliament, industry and unions. It is apparent that the TPP-11 contains harmful provisions which will acts to the detriment of the Australian economy, including ISDS and labour-market-testing exemptions. This is not just my view; it is the view shared by the Electrical Trades Union and many other unions. But what does Labor do about these concerns? They say, 'Don't worry. We will address it at some future stage.' Sorry, that is simply not good enough. Labor had a chance to prevent this deal going through with these bad provisions in them, and they have folded like a cheap suit.</span>

                  </a> This motion is in relation to the fact that backing in the TPP is the exact opposite of what is required by the Labor Party on their own platform. What this motion does is exposes the sheer hypocrisy of the Labor Party. They have been absolutely hoodwinked by the Morrison government, the corporate donors and the big multinationals, which are going to absolutely benefit from this deal while everybody else is left out in the cold. It is a bad deal for consumers. It is a bad, bad deal for workers. All it does is line the pockets of big business and donors to both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. That's why they are cuddling up together, and it is a disgrace. The Labor Party have just thrown Australian workers under the bus, and they know it.</span>

                  </a>  I intend to support this motion. This is not because of any concerns I have particularly about the TPP, because this is not specifically about its merits or otherwise; it is calling upon the Labor Party to explain the apparent hypocrisy of their position and their national platform now that they've endorsed the TPP with elements that go against it. So I'll be supporting this motion. Please don't read that as my concerns about the TPP; that is a separate issue altogether. It's certainly not an endorsement of the Greens position on the TPP, but in this case I think they have a valid point that the Labor Party needs to be accountable for.</span>

                  </a>  The committee has already extended the date for accepting submissions to 28 September, and tomorrow the committee will deal with further proposals to extend the date for submissions to 19 October and to schedule public hearings in five cities between 29 October and 8 November so we can report on 26 November. The Law Council and the Bar Association were provided with early drafts of the legislation in mid-July, so this new date for submissions would allow three months to review and make submissions, time rarely allowed for other legislation dealt with by this committee. People involved with the family law courts are almost universal in their condemnation of the delays and inefficiencies, and the consolidation of the courts is one step towards achieving a more efficient and better outcome and would be welcomed by those involved in the court system. Senator Patrick's proposal would mean that submissions would still be being received after the committee had conducted public hearings and three days before the reporting date.</span>

                  </a>  Under the cover of the Liberal Party's brutal assassination of its former Prime Minister on 24 August, government members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee ignored the decision of this place to report on the government's radical Family Court bills in April next year. The government members' new timetable, demonstrating their arrogant contempt for the Australian people they are meant to represent, would give no time to the committee to travel to regional communities to hear how they might be affected by the proposed changes. This is unacceptable. Labor supports this motion to allow the Australian people, including vulnerable families that use the Family Court system, time to respond to the government's radical proposals and a proper process of public hearings to be conducted in the first months of next year in both regional Australia and capital cities.</span>

                  </a>  It was with some reluctance that I moved this motion, but I did so after I attended a committee meeting and was confronted with a direction that the committee would close submissions in just three weeks, which I thought was an entirely inappropriate time frame, and, unfortunately, no discussion was to be entered into. That's not how the committees of the Senate work. We are very collegial and I am hopeful that, after this motion, we can start working together in that usual collegial manner to sort out how to advance this in time.</span>

                  </a>  I know the importance of the family law court and the family circuit court. It is impacting on many Australians' lives and it has been held up because of being thrown between the Family Court and the circuit court. The government's proposal to actually meld the two together is going to help the Australian people. This is not about a consultation that's needed with the people in rural and regional areas. This is about the process of working with the courts' workings so that those judges are doing the work to alleviate the pressures on the courts with the cases. Cases now take about 2Â½ to three years before they're actually heard. Amalgamating the court system will mean that those judges who are sitting thereâ€”and one judge has only worked nine days in one yearâ€”will start doing the work for the people. So that's why it's imperative that this is done. It's not a matter of holding up consultation. The people want this to happen. So I won't be supporting this. It needs to go through as soon as possible. And let them start answering the backup of cases in the court system.</span>

John McEnroe wasn't penalised a point or a game for bad behaviour; he was disqualified from the Australian Open. The cartoon depicted a large black talented female tennis player smashing a racquet and throwing a tantrum. Serena Williams is a large black talented female tennis player who was smashing a racquet and throwing a tantrum. I thought it was a very clever, observant cartoon comment.

                  </a>  Australia recognises that Pacific island countries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and disasters and that this is a top priority for the region. At the Pacific Island Forum in 2016 Australia committed $300 million to address climate change and disaster resilience in the Pacific. Just two years on we've already spent nearly $200 million. Australia is committed to the Paris agreement for global action to address this global challenge. Australia stands by our international commitments. Our target of 26 to 28 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 is reasonable and economically responsible, and in step with other developed countries, and takes into account our national circumstances.</span>

                  </a>  The government is so concerned about the impact of climate change on our Pacific neighbours that they make jokes about water lapping at their door. That's how concerned they are about it. We've just had the recent Pacific Island Forum. The very existence of our Pacific neighbours is under threat. We've got rising sea levels. We've got storm surges. We have salinity, which is going to destroy agriculture for our Pacific island neighbours. They have pleaded with us to take action. They have pleaded with us to lead this debate, and yet what have we got? We've got a government that ditches its climate policy, its energy policy. It's effectively walked away from our Paris climate agreements. We say to our neighbours in the Pacific: the way we're going to get action in this country on climate change is by turfing those opposite out and getting a government that's serious about this and ensuring we start to take the action that they desperately need.</span>

                  </a>  The EPBC Act only allows for suspension and revocation of approvals in limited circumstances. The decision by the Queensland government to prosecute Abbot Point Bulkcoal for breach of a temporary emissions licence during Cyclone Debbie in 2017 relates to state environmental regulations and does not provide grounds for suspension or revocation under national environmental law. The Department of the Environment and Energy is working with the Queensland environment department to investigate allegations that Adani sunk groundwater dewatering bores before relevant plans were approved. It would be premature to take action before the department determines whether a breach has occurred.</span>

                  </a>  Under their reporting, Adani must report in a specified time, which they did. Upon reflection of that, they were found not to be guilty of the problems up there at Abbot Point. It was due to Cyclone Debbie. They were fined $12,000, but they are appealing against that breach. So this is not right. Under the rules, they have to report. They did the reporting in the specified time. It's found then that they never breached it whatsoever. So they're appealing against it.</span>

                  </a>  I ask senators not to leave the chamber, please, for this two minutes, because I urge you to read a recently released report on the situation of human rights in Yemen, including violations and abuses since September 2014. It's a report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights containing the findings of a group of independent, eminent international and regional experts, and a summary of technical assistance provided by the high commissioner.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these eminent experts was the previous member for Fremantle Melissa Parke. I would say the report is absolutely essential reading. Although I warn senators that it's not easy readingâ€”in fact, it's actually quite chilling. But if we are to understand the importance of the second part of this motion, why Australia shouldn't be selling arms and military technology to the United Arab Emirates or to Saudi Arabiaâ€”what are commonly called the 'coalition'â€”then you really must read and understand this report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Right around the world countries are deciding to stop arms sales to the coalition, because of the flagrant and repeated human rights abuses that are occurring in the Yemen civil war by all sides. Recently, we've seen Spain pull out of arms sales to the coalition forces. We've seen movements in the UK, France and in Washington to pull out of arms sales. We have seen EU countries like Finland, Germany and Belgium ban arms sales to the United Arab Emirates and to Saudi Arabia. There's no reason Australia should be trying to develop an arms industry in this country and exporting bloodshed and death to these countries. It's simply unacceptable. I urge senators to read that reportâ€” <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  This motion is an illustration of why motions are not appropriate for dealing with foreign affairs issues. The conflict in Yemen is a civil war, like in Syria, but it's also part of a larger conflict within the Muslim community between Sunnis and Shiah. It's longstanding and it's dividing the Muslim world quite extensively. The Shiite side is led by Iran, which is sponsoring the Houthi rebels in Yemen. It's also promoting conflict in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. On the Sunni side are Turkey, Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia amongst othersâ€”Saudi Arabia being the subject of this motion. The impact of Australian arms sales to Saudi Arabia in that context is far more complex than the Greens could ever contemplate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  The failure of the opposition to make its immigration policy public is of grave concern given that most commentators predict a Labor landslide at the next federal election. Labor will say they have an immigration policy, but the ALP national platform gives no indication of the level or mix of migrants to be given permanent visas each year. Instead, there are motherhood statements like 'we celebrate immigration' and 'the miracle of multiculturalism'. There is no admission of the problems that have been caused by multiculturalism, which means these problems go unsolved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Voters have a right to know what Labor and their partners, the Greens, will do in government with respect to the number of permanent visas to be issued under the skilled program, family reunions and humanitarian program. Labor have been coy about the immigration numbers because they know that if their base knew what they had in store for them they would not vote for them. Labor know commute times to work will double and access to hospitals and a good education will decrease if immigration rates continue, but they won't tell the voters the truth. Instead, Labor say immigration is good for the economy. But there is no evidence of that. It should be remembered that the economic miracle in Japan after World War II was achieved with no immigration at all. When Luke Foley, the Labor state leader in New South Wales, talked about 'white flight' he was quickly silenced, because there is no place in Labor for the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, the coalition has set targets of around 220,000 permanent migrants a year, which is less than the 300,000-plus set by the Rudd government in 2013. To say Labor have been vague about their intentions in respect of immigration is an understatement. But we do know that anything Labor wants to do in respect of immigration will have to have the agreement of the Greens, because Labor needs the Greens to form government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the Labor mayor of Liverpool City Council, in Western Sydney, called for a bigger Australia. She said the only questions to be resolved are how much bigger and how quickly we want to get there. Ms Waller went on to say that immigration has been 'great for our economy' and that 'cultural diversity is our strength'. She seems not to know that most conflicts in the world are rooted in diversity. We need to find a balance between cultural diversity and an obligation to commit to our values and political institutions which guarantee our freedoms and liberal democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are now significant geographical concentrations of overseas-born people in Sydney and Melbourne, which suggests the past patterns of integration will not continue. If the current settlement patterns persist, we will end up like Europe. We already have electorates, like Banks, Parramatta and Fowler, where the number of people born overseas far outweighs the number of people born in Australia. How does anyone expect these newcomers to integrate into Australia when most people around them were born overseas?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation's immigration policy is clearly set out on the One Nation website. Our policy recognises that large-scale migration in a country which cannot reproduce itself is bound to change the culture and ethnic make-up of Australia. We cannot unscramble the egg but we can be honest and recognise that problems exist and they need to be solved, and solved now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I view with grave concern the fact that Labor and the Greens are satisfied that mastery of English can be established by getting 12 questions right in a 20-question multiple-choice test. This standard is the lowest in the world for any comparable country, with the result that over one million people cannot speak English well or at all. This means a large number of people cannot participate in work or other aspects of our society. Labor and the Greens believe supporting low language standards for citizenship will win their candidates enough votes to deliver government. They do newcomers a disservice, because it is in the interests of migrants to master the language so they can fully engage in society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation and the Greens see the future of Australia very differently. A recent survey found that the overwhelming majority of Greens voters do not take pride in the Australian way of life or believe that maintaining the Australian way of life and culture is important. Let me say that again. Seventy-five per cent of Greens voters said that maintaining the Australian way of life and culture is unimportant. That doesn't really surprise me. I see the way they vote in this chamber. They are so wrong. The Australian way of life is worth keeping and it is what I will fight for in this place. The Australian way of life is what attracts people to Australia. It is what Australians have fought for in war. It has been created by hard work and love of this country. The Australian way of life is the social glue that keeps us together. Social cohesion has been taken for granted by successive governments as, each year, they set immigration targets without a thought about the cumulative effects on society. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens gagged debate on my proposal in the Plebiscite (Future Migration Level) Bill 2018 to give Australians a say in the level of immigration at the next federal election. The last thing Labor wants is a reduced level of immigration because, as has been known since the days of Barry Jones, newcomers to Australia tend to vote Labor. The voices of minority groups are over-represented in the parliament because the major political parties take for granted the silent majority and pander to minorities, which can make the difference between winning and losing a seat in parliament. Labor says multiculturalism has been a miracle, but the truth is that multiculturalism has been a mix of success and failure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't get me wrong. There have been many successes and I applaud the hardworking Asian families. It is, however, time to deal with the failures of multiculturalism, which we see as culturally separate communities, because in these communities a shared sense of national identity is weak. In these circumstances, the identity is replaced by a religious or ethnic identity. Today we are seeing clear evidence of cultural separatism by some migrants. The Greens political party represents the rights of those culturally separate communities to remain separate, and Labor in government will be forced to bend to the Greens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some migrants from the Middle East have formed culturally separate communities where they keep the language, custom and culture of their homeland in an attempt to recreate the villages of their birth. They reject our way of life and our valuesâ€”but not our welfare system and not our free health system. Just take the train from Sydney to Bankstown, walk down the main street of Lakemba and nearby suburbs and count the number of bulk-billing medical practices. And look at the statistics for welfare payments by postcode. It is here that English is not spoken well or at all. Employment participation is low and welfare dependency is high. These communities are bad for social cohesion, bad for the economy and bad for national security because amongst this group are those who want to Islamise Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal politicians want to minimise the perception of national security problems arising from these communities, but you cannot ignore the spending by state and federal governments in respect of Islamic terrorism. Every major city has seen changes to its public spaces, with concrete bollards placed to impede an extremist from murdering people with a vehicle. Here in the parliament we agreed to spend $160 million to strengthen security because of extremism, and we know that is Islamic extremism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: I appreciate Australian Muslims are a diverse group, but a significant minority of Australian Muslims told the Scanlon survey that they don't feel Australian, they reject our way of life, our values and our institutions and they want to change Australia. I ask voters to look at the One Nation immigration policy, which is up on our website. The policy is well balanced and carefully thought through. I make no excuse for putting the interests of citizens first.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MOLAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  It's a noble cause to try to find out what exactly the migration policy of the opposition is. What a good thing it would be to actually know it. I spent a good deal of 2011, 2012 and going into 2013 trying to figure out exactly what its policy was. At that time, all I could figure out was that it consisted of having very, very large committee meetings of 12 to 15 institutions and ministries trying to figure out how they could solve a problem which they in fact had created. The Australian people certainly deserve to know what the opposition policy is on migration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment we have a migration system which consists of skilled migrants. Roughly half of those are not skilled; they are families who have accompanied the skilled migrants into Australia. We have family reunion visas. We have a first-class humanitarian visaâ€”18,750 people per year. And we have a very large temporary movement of people to Australia. Labor in its day, during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd period, had two-thirds of the total migration numbers being due to family reunion and only one-third relating to an economic outcome. We have reversed that. That is a real achievement. Now we have two-thirds that are related to the good of this country through economics and one-third related to families. At any one time there are about two million people on temporary visas in this countryâ€”roughly 700,000 of them are New Zealanders, half a million of them are students, and we find we have about 300,000 tourists at any one time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Educational visas are very, very important for us. They're important for education, but we certainly hope that the main aim of many of those educational visas is not a migration outcome. Education is important because it's the third-biggest export industry of this country. It brings in $31 billionâ€”much more than beef, for example, or any of the other more popular and more considered export industries of this country. The 165,000 people who came to this country through skilled and family visas last year was down from 190,000 seven years ago. We remember that what were called 457 visas were being abused at the time of us taking government and the skills component had been degraded. Now the temporary skill shortage visa has re-established the skills part of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government does have a migration policy. It's committed to ensuring a stronger and more secure Australia for all Australians, and that's what we have done. Only this government has the right policies and plans to ensure that our borders remain secure and no more lives are lost at sea. Only we have that record in both controlling borders effectively and bringing people into this country for the good of this country. The coalition government is taking steps to reform our immigration system to modernise and focus on delivering the best possible outcome for all Australians. The Australian government has consistently said that people subject to regional processing arrangements will not be resettled in Australiaâ€”and this will not change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Operation Sovereign Borders, we've taken back control of our borders from the people smugglers. The Australian government's resolve to combat maritime people smuggling has not changed. This government's immigration policy, unlike the opposition's, is very, very clear. Unlike those opposite, we're committed to ensuring a stronger and secure Australia for all Australians. The coalition government's policy includes investing a record $75 billion in infrastructure to manage those people and so those people who come to Australia can benefit from that. Over 10 years, that's in our nation's infrastructure to futureproof Australia's transport networks. This government is focused on building local communities, connecting the regions and our cities, relieving congestion and boosting productivity while creating local jobs. That is absolutely essential to balance a migration policy out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Operation Sovereign Borders is something that I was involved in deeply. The coalition's Operation Sovereign Borders is a joint-agency, coordinated effort not just to turn back boats on the oceans but to disrupt people-smuggling activities across the region which resulted from those opposite losing total control of our borders. Operation Sovereign Borders has been successful in detecting, intercepting and stopping the boats. Our maritime surveillance and response capabilities have been reinforced with expanded aerial surveillance and on-water operations, and it is a credit to Customs, the public servants and the officials who have been involved in this. Thirty-three vessels have been intercepted at sea and 827 people have been returned to their country of departure or origin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is attributable for the deaths at sea and created the mess that this government has fixed. We keep on asking, and we keep on saying to ourselves, 'What exactly is the opposition's border policy?' We wonder who makes it. We look around and we wonder where this policy comes from. Does it come from Mr Shorten? Does it come from members in the Senate? The only thing that I can find really is that Ms Ged Kearney, for example, comes out with a degree of irrationality. But she is not on her own. She claims that what we do is racist dog whistling. She demonises us and vilifies a community. She says that what we are doing is solely for gain. She, very cleverly, redefines the criteria to accept asylum seekersâ€”that is, from a place of conflict and found to be a refugee in another country. She says we can afford it and she says that we act against international agreements, which we do not. She sees the detention and the deterrent created by offshore processing as indefinite, which it is not, and punitive, which it is not. What she wants to do is to move the asylum seekers off and ensure that indefinite detention does not happen again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor might say it believes in border control. It might say it believes in border control, but it really has absolutely no idea. The success of Operation Sovereign Borders was based on many things, but most importantly there were turnbacks, temporary protection visas and offshore processing. If we take any one of those away we will find it will all start again. We've seen this before, with former Prime Minister Rudd. He said he supported and would maintain border control. He did not. We did after 2013. He produced 1,200 dead bodies that we know of, 600 boats and 50,000 asylum seekers. We closed onshore detention centres, got children out of detention, saved vast amounts of money and controlled the borders. But about 30 Labor people at the last election declared that they didn't believe in regional processing centres and repeated that in their annual conference soon after that. Labor certainly calls people 'racist' for having this kind of policy. Those on the left always use those terms of abuse. This is a kind of John Setka, CFMEU approach; it is bullying and abusive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that it cannot win if it doesn't embrace what we have done so successfully as a migration policy. This makes Ms Ged Kearney's approach very, very interesting. Even Frank Brennan has generally agreed that what we did in Operation Sovereign Borders was good, but he would like to bring people back to Australia. We would certainly love to get people out of offshore processing centres. We would be very keen to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have not met one person in the government who wants to keep them thereâ€”not one single person. So we're working to get people off and we're doing that very, very successfully, and we will get people off. Critics say that it is politicians who put them there. They put them thereâ€”Labor put them thereâ€”and we got them off. If this MPI can in any way, shape or form force the opposition to come out with a straight-out different kind of migration policy, we and the Australian people would benefit greatly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  Can I make it clear that Senator Hanson's MPI makes a claim that is patently untrue. She of course is supported by her ideological ally, Senator Molan, in making an assertion that the opposition has failed to make public its immigration policy. Senator Molan just told us that he spent an enormous amount of time trying to find our policy. For Senator Hanson's benefit and Senator Molan's benefit, may I draw to the Senate's attention the stated position of the Labor Party as outlined in our national platform? I've shown this to the Government Whip. I seek leave to table, from chapter 2, sections 79 and 92 on skilled migration, and, from chapter 9, sections 25 and 35 on multiculturalism.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator KIM CARR:</span>
                  </a>  I know Senator Hanson is somewhat reluctant to deal with the facts. I know that she's somewhat reluctant to deal with the simple proposition that these are documents that have been on the public record for many, many years. But she could have consulted the positions put forward by our shadow minister on immigration, Mr Neumann, or by many, many other Labor spokespeople on these questions. Of course, these would be statements that would be able to inform, to educate, to enlightenâ€”which is the last thing that Senator Hanson or Senator Molan would want to do. They're in the business of propagating ignorance, of propagating division and of propagating the most extraordinary disunity in this country. They're in the business of making sure that people peddle ignorance about what this country is and what has been the great strength of this country throughout the 20th century. It's only too easy to insinuate that somehow or other there are people here in this country who are illegitimate and to insinuate that people are in this country inappropriately when the facts are so different. It is too easy to peddle fear, to peddle xenophobia and to peddle misinformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth of the matter is simply this: the enormous prosperity and the rich social diversity of this country have been created because we have constructed a country which is unique throughout the world in building social cohesion, in building tolerance and in building aspirations for people throughout the world to be attracted to this country and to seek a better life in this country. And what's the benefit to this country? It's been the incredible wealth and prosperity of this nation. We know that we are a self-confident and proud nation because of the contribution of over 7Â½ million migrants since the Second World War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great achievements of Labor governmentsâ€”under the foundations laid by John Curtin, under Ben Chifley, with the postwar reconstruction work, and under Arthur Calwellâ€”was the development of a mass immigration program. We took people from all over the world and, as a consequence, this nation is so much the better for it. We are a country that should be proud of our achievements. We reinforced that great achievement with the Whitlam government, which ended the White Australia policy. And we have been stronger in our commitment to immigration throughout successive Labor governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might add that this used to be a position that enjoyed a high level of bipartisanship in this country. I make the point that, in my state, which is now the fastest growing part of the country, we have seen the enormous prosperity that is as a result of that population growth. In Victoria, we are now seeing the state moving forward to the point where I understand that something like 40 per cent of Melbourne's population was born overseas. We have diversity in terms of our geographical spread, which demonstrates the capacity of our country to absorb people from all different walks of life and for them to work closely together to enjoy the prosperity that they bring to each other. This approach has been as a result of ensuring that we have proper regulation of our labour market programs, that we enjoy the proper protection of the law and that we enjoy a tolerant and compassionate approach to our social welfare programs, to our health programs and to our education programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have this dog whistle presented by the Right in Australian politics, saying, 'Well, of course, somehow or another these folks who might come from other parts of the world are illegitimate. They're a strain on our infrastructure,' instead of saying, 'These are the problems of politics, of resource allocation, of governments that have to make the decisions about the future of the country.' There are groups of people in this country who would like to turn Australian against Australian. It is not unique to our time. We have seen this throughout our history. We have seen it against the Irish. The first members of my family came to this country in 1817. They came as guests of the Right. They came and settled in the Hunter in New South Wales. They were the product of the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland. They were subject to the gross social inequalities that arose in the 19th century. My family have now married into a Jewish family. We know the great history of the Jewish community and how they came to this country, the circumstances under which they came and the discrimination they suffered. But we have also seen it with regard to eastern Europeans in this countryâ€”the abuse and intolerance that has been suffered by various groups from eastern Europe. Various Slavic groups were said to be undermining the national identity. We have seen this attitude against Muslims. We have seen it against Hindus. We have seen it against Sikhs. We have seen it against Buddhists. Now we are seeing it against Muslims again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is where it requires national leadership. It actually requires this parliament to stand up for national integrity. It requires all of us to stand firm against ignorance and intolerance. It requires this parliament to actually say no to intolerance and racial inequality. It requires us as a political system to say there are Australian values that are much bigger and much broader than any notion of trying to take advantage of one Australian being forced to work against another. That's what's so disappointing. There are sections in this country now, there are people in this country now, who are seeking to divide. Instead of dealing with the responsibilities of government and the responsibility of statecraft to ensure that the resources of this country are distributed properly and equally, we are, in fact, trying to divide, to encourage xenophobia, to encourage hatred, to encourage division and to undermine those great Australian values of equality and of a fair go. That's the tragedy of these propositions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're told, 'Well, the Labor Party doesn't have a position.' We do have a position. We stand firmly against fear and prejudice and ignorance. We stand against those who would suppress people's quest for equal rights. We demand in this country that people get a fair go and that they speak the truth when it comes to fundamental issues about race and ethnicity, about the state's responsibility, the Commonwealth's responsibility, to provide proper education and health services, proper opportunities. We certainly don't seek to undermine people's engagement in this country, whether it be through international education or whether it be about participation in this society more generally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson is seeking to exploit that for very narrow political advantage. The long-term consequence is to put this country at profound disadvantage and to put the Australian people at profound disadvantage, and the politics of division inevitably comes back on those who promote it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  Labor's migration policy is pretty clear to me and pretty clear to the Australian Greens. I agree with a lot of what Senator Carr has just said. But, I will say to you, Mr President, that none of Senator Carr's fine words can be said to apply to the men, women and children that Labor put into offshore hellholes on Manus Island and Nauru and who have remained there for over five long years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, as we debate this, there is a suicidal girl on Nauru, a 12-year-old girl, who home affairs minister Peter Dutton is refusing permission to leave Nauru and be brought back to Australia. At 12 years old, she's tried to take her own life on multiple occasions, including by trying to set herself on fire. She is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder and a major depressive mental health condition. There is no doubt that her mental health problems have been caused because she's been locked up on Nauru for over five years, and deliberately denied hope, by the bipartisanship policy of cruelty that's held by the Labor and Liberal parties. This little girl needs treatment in Australia. Doctors are pleading for this girl's life. Thus far, their pleas and the pleas of her parents have fallen on deaf ears. Doctors say she will die unless she is removed from Nauru. This 12-year-old girl told a psychiatrist this: 'The only way to get out of here is suicide. It's better being dead than here.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know for a fact that immigration minister Peter Dutton could bring her here with the stroke of a pen, yet he has not done so. The fact he's not done so makes him guilty of child abuse. I'll say it again. Minister Dutton is a child abuser. He's not just guilty of abusing this 12-year-old girl but guilty of systemic child abuse over a period of years. Mark my words, if someone who was responsible for a 12-year-old child in Australia, a suicidal child, refused them proper medical care when they had the capacity to get it they would be charged with criminal offences and locked up for years. Minister Dutton is responsible for these children, and he has been since he took office as immigration minister. Decency and compassion demands that he acts, and he has consistently and repeatedly refused.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are dozens of children on Nauru right now still suffering because of Minister Dutton's indifference, an indifference, I might add, that is mirrored by his mentor in torture, Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The hundreds of men, women and childrenâ€”innocent people who've committed no offence under Australian law, who've acted entirely consistently with the refugee convention that Australia is a signatory toâ€”have had their lives and their hopes systematically destroyed because of the zombie lock step between the ALP and the LNP on this bipartisan policy of cruelty. They've suffered for years because of decisions made in this building and in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This cruelty, this child abuse, this systemic removal of hope, this deliberate regime of dehumanisation that we've seen cruelly cripple so many lives on Manus Island on Nauruâ€”we've seen over 12 people die on Manus Island and Nauru; we've seen child sexual abuse; we've seen rapes; we've seen murders; we've seen the Papua New Guinean navy firing submachine guns and shotguns into people's bedrooms on Manus Islandâ€”it all has to stop. It has to stop now. We have the capacity to sort this issue outâ€”everyone in this chamberâ€”and those who continually refuse to do so need to take a long, long, hard look at themselves in the mirror.</span>

                  </a>  Thank youâ€”what's happening on Nauru. Senator McKim, I've actually had the opportunity of visiting Nauru on a number of occasions. I've had the opportunity to talk to people. I've had the opportunity to see where the children go to school. I've had the opportunity to see the medical facilities. I've had the opportunity to see every part of Nauru. And I can tell you that part of the reason there is false hope on Nauru is that people like yourselves and advocates like you continually give people false hope.</span>

But when you talk to people they say, 'Oh, but when we talk to people in Australia they tell us we just have to wait for a change.' Now, what does that change mean? That change means change of government, because it's people like you who are giving them false hope, and it's people like you who make them go into circumstances in which they have false hope. So you, Senator McKim, have to take some responsibilityâ€”</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. So, I have seen, for myself, firsthand. I have talked to people firsthand in Nauru. That's why I can stand here and say what I am saying today, that people like Senator McKim are giving people false hope. So, Senator McKim and those advocates like him have to bear some of the responsibility. Indeed, they have to bear most of the responsibility in this situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus on a number of things. The coalition's position in relation to immigration is very clear. We put in place policies to ensure that our borders remain secure and that no more lives will be lost at sea. Operation Sovereign Borders was successful. It didn't just turn the boats back on the oceans; it also disrupted the people-smuggling activities across our region, which resulted from those opposite losing control of our borders. Operation Sovereign Borders was successful in detecting, in intercepting and in stopping the boats. Australia's maritime, surveillance and response capabilities have been reinforced with expanded aerial surveillance and on-water patrols. Since Operation Sovereign Borders, 33 vessels have been intercepted at sea and 827 people returned to their country of departure or origin. When you look at the mess that those opposite left when they left government, their Greens-Labor alliance was responsible for a policy that resulted in deaths at sea. And we stopped that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite probably don't want to remember when we had then opposition leader Kevin Rudd. Remember those press conferences that he used to do on a Sunday morning outside church, trying to convince us that he was really conservative and basically a Howard-lite? He promised us, 'Of course we'll turn back the boats.' That's what he promised us. That's what he was quoted as saying. As soon as he became Prime Minister, those opposite, Labor and their Greens alliance partners, changed their policy immediately. They completely dismantled the framework of the Howard government years. They changed program after program after program. They dismantled what we had done. And that is what they will do if they get into power again. They effectively dismantled that whole Howard-era framework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what then happened during the years that they were in government? Of course, they lost control of our borders. Therefore, in the end, we saw record numbers of people arriving on boats. Over 50,000 people arrived on over 800 boats. As I said, we had over 1,200 deaths at seaâ€”and that's all that we know of. Under those opposite, there were over 8,000 children detained in immigration detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the height of the policy failures of those opposite, in July 2013, there were over 10,000 people in detention, almost 2,000 of whom were children. Did we hear people like Senator McKim jumping up and down and complaining about that? No! Where were the complaints? Where were the shouts of complaint from the Greens? No, we didn't hear anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also saw happen was a $16 billion border-protection budget blowout. Under the Gillard government, three-quarters of a billion dollars was diverted from our overseas development assistance budget to pay for Labor's border protection blowouts, making the Gillard government the third-largest recipient of its own Australian overseas development program. The Labor government twice took $375 million from overseas development assistance funding and spent it on asylum-seeker detention in Australia. They let people smugglers have greater control, effectively, over our overseas development assistance budget than their own government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did this mean? This meant that overseas development assistance was cut to 25 developing countries, including very small island countries like Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. Today we had Senator Di Natale going on about issues pertinent to the Pacific. Well, they weren't complaining when Labor was cutting overseas development assistance to the Pacific at that time.</span>

                  </a>  Well, I didn't hear you very loudlyâ€”through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, we didn't hear Senator McKim very loudly on that point. Of course, as we know, we have stopped the boats and stopped the deaths at sea. What is also very important in terms of our dealing with issues pertinent to immigration is the fact that it's important that we also stabilise situations to support people to remain in countries of first asylum and not take the perilous journeys in the first place. For example, in my former portfolio, we committed funding of $220 million over three years to ensure that our humanitarian partners could better support refugees and internally displaced communities as a result of the Syria conflict. Funding has been announced in recent times in relation to humanitarian and stabilisation assistance in Iraq.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From my experience with refugee resettlement and then in international development, I think that it is far, far better for us to be supporting people to remain close to their home country than uprooting them and bringing them thousands of kilometres away. I think, in the end, that is ultimately the best situationâ€”that is, to assist people to go back to their country of origin when those countries are stabilised, because, I think, ultimately, it is not only what refugees themselves want; it is the most cost-effective solution for them and, obviously, for the Australian public.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is an important debate to be had, because what is clear and what history has clearly shown us is what those opposite, the Labor-Greens alliance, would doâ€”as, has been clearly said before, Labor owe their time in parliament to Greens preferences. Ultimately, what we will see, if those opposite have any opportunity to go back to the Treasury benches, is a dismantling, yet again, of the coalition's effective border protection policies. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  This matter of public importance today is nothing but a shallow political attempt to mask over the attempts of the government to create fear and division in the Australian community for their political advantage. What is Senator Hanson's motivation in putting up this motion? Well, it's pretty clear to me. She might as well join the coalition. Is it part of one of the deals that she's cut with the government to secure her vote for legislation? Well, perhaps I think so. I would call on Senator Hanson, through you, Acting Deputy President Williams, to be more focused on this muppet show of a government rather than on Labor. Our approach to immigration is very clear. We have a very clear policy on asylum seekers, on people trafficking and on immigration. What we have coming from the other side, from the government, is nothing more than bubbles of populism and no real plan for our nation to manage these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that Australia is a country built on migration. We are rightfully very proud of all those who have come to Australia by choice. Some 7.5 million migrants since World War II have helped build the strong, vibrant and multicultural society that we all enjoy today. A recent poll found the majority of Australians, some 54 per cent, say Australia's openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation. Australia's permanent migration is capped at some 190,000 people per year. There are real problems in our nation when it comes to infrastructure, energy and communications, but it is not migrants and immigration policy that are to blame for these issues. It is the failure of the government to properly invest in our cities and communities and to manage these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the upcoming federal election, one of the issues that's going to be front and centre is the fact that we have congestion and cities bursting at the seams. We have people with very long commutes. We have growing urban communities in new suburbs where we've got suburban corridors popping up without the infrastructure and community services that they need to thrive and survive as communitiesâ€”without the planning for job creation, without the planning for their commute and without the appropriate investment in health, education and community services to meet their demands as a community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So if Senator Hanson wants someone to blame she need look no further than the Morrison Liberal government, the same government Senator Hanson sides with some 90 per cent of the time that she votes in this chamber. These aren't the problems of migrants. These are problems that fall very squarely at the feet of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Their internal chaos is exacerbating these issues on the ground for the Australian people. You can see that in the energy debate. You can see that in our climate change debate. You can see that in the chaos they have created in our education investment debate. You can see that in cuts to Medicare and to our hospitals. You can also very much see that in the stagnant wages of Australians, unaffordable housing and clogged infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need policies to tackle housing affordability, build infrastructure in our cities and ensure that local workers get the first shot at local jobs. But what we have coming from those opposite is all talk and no action on any of these deep policy issues. We should be calling on the Prime Minister to release any migration or population policy in full rather than spruiking the half-baked ideas that have been coming out of his mouth in an attempt to appease his own internal divisions. We on this side believe that reforms to Australia's migration program should improve its integrity and make the visa system easier to understand. When the Liberals actually announce a policy, we will want to take that policy through our processes in the usual way to ensure proper scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we have coming from the other side are, in fact, new reports showing that the Liberal government are issuing temporary work visas for occupations they'd previously slashed from the skilled occupation list. Seven hundred visas were granted for jobs that had been previously axed from the 457 program but then slipped back onto the list just six months after their highly publicised cut. What more proof do we need that the Liberals have botched their changes to temporary skilled migration and that they cannot be trusted with Australian jobs? What we have before us is a scandal. The Liberals refuse to address the growing number of people from overseas being given temporary work visas at the same time as slashing funding to our TAFE and further education sector. Their immigration policies are putting Australian workers at the back of the jobs queue. Too many Australians under this government are being put at the back of the jobs queue. The government are doing this by doing things like cracking down on 457 visas without consulting affected stakeholders. The subsequent changes and revisions to the skilled occupation list has sent waves of uncertainty and resulted in subsequent revisions to the skilled occupation list. This has meant the business, innovation and education sectors have all unfortunately been affected. This is how the government manage their migration policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were reports of the Minister for Home Affairs' own departmental officials describing their minister's skilled migration changes as a dog's breakfast. When I look at Australia's immigration policy, I've seen who's in charge. I've been chairing the inquiry into Minister Dutton's dealings with au pairs. I've been looking at the issue of who is treated fairly and who is not treated fairly in the ministerial intervention process. I can say that there are thousands of people who request from the minister a ministerial intervention based on meeting the guidelines for compassionate grounds and who it is in the public interest of Australia to accept and he does not even open a file to look at their cases. But when it comes to taking a phone call through his office from a mate, who is a donor to the Liberal Party, that's the kind of immigration policy that we have in Australia today. That is what has motivated this government's approach to these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear here this afternoon, migrants contribute to our shared history of our nation, our way of life and our economy. Senator Hanson, just like the Liberals, is more focused on Labor than she is on the issues affecting the Australian people. I call on Senator Hanson to seek to blame the out of touch Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, who is more focused on his own job rather than helping everyday Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I could not disagree more strongly with Senator Hanson. I'm not afraid to note publicly that Australia's population grew by four million to 24.4 million in the 11 years to 2016, and that 62 per cent of that growth was from overseas migrationâ€”as she challenged us in this place. More than that, I'm not afraid to say that Australia is a beacon of multiculturalism by global standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Immigration has proved a benefit to the prosperity of the nation and the wellbeing of its citizens. On that score, the data backs me up. Nor am I afraid to say that far from being a drain on our resources, many migrants with limited or no English have made significant contributions to the nation. Just look at the figures. A report commissioned by Treasury and the Department of Home Affairs found, for example, that in 2014-15 skilled migrants would make a lifetime net contribution to the budget of $6.9 billion. The report found that migration cushioned Australia from the shocks of the global financial crisis and that the current migration program would add up to one per cent to annual GDP growth between 2020 and 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My home state of South Australia has suffered for years from a one-size-fits-all immigration policy. South Australia needs more people to ensure the future prosperity of the state and the wellbeing of its citizens. South Australia should not suffer, because poor planning has led to population pressures in Sydney and Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of years ago the Turnbull government tightened the terms of working visas. As a result, a South Australian Centre for Economic Studies report concluded that South Australian employers, particularly in regional areas, were not able to access employees with the skills that they require. At a time when the number of skilled visas issued for South Australia has dropped by nearly 25 per cent in just three years, I agree with Business SA that our state needs special status to attract workers to areas with staff shortages, and there is overwhelming community support. A Property Council survey found that 95 per cent of respondents in South Australia agreed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud efforts by the South Australian government to convince the Commonwealth to fast-track migrant applications for my home state. As a former Prime Minister used to say, Australia is the greatest multicultural nation on earth and so it should remain.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  There is no more vital question confronting the nation than the immigration problem. Who we allow to come to this country, their ethnicity, their culture, what language they speak and what they believe will define the nation that we will be in the future. What is not generally understood is that if our immigration program does not at least mirror current society then we will be an entirely different society in years to come. Yet, incredibly, neither previous Labor government policy nor current Liberal government policy appears to recognise this simple fact. Thanks to bipartisan support from both the Liberals and Labor for a non-discriminatory immigration program, the ethno-religious background of migrants, the key determinant of their ability to assimilate and integrate, is being ignored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This MPI no doubt seeks to bemoan the fact that the opposition is yet to make public its immigration policy, but I don't see that as a problem at all. Given the hopeless, nation-destroying failures of past Labor and Liberal government immigration policies, including the rorting of student and 457 visas for backdoor immigration by hundreds of thousands of Third World immigrants looking to enjoy our welfare state, the opposition not yet making public its immigration policy is a wonderful opportunity. It is an established fact that ethno-religious diversity undermines social cohesion. So, instead of having an immigration policy that divides us and drives white flight from inner Melbourne and Western Sydney, I urge the Labor Party to embrace a new immigration direction that helps to unite us as a people. It's time for a plebiscite for the Australian people to decide who comes to this country. I urge the Labor Party to adopt this as their policy. I urge the Leader of the Opposition to move beyond middle-class virtue signalling and to embrace his inner Arthur Calwell and return Labor to its former glory as a champion of the European, Christian working class. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to addressing family violence and improving the protections offered through the family law system to those affected by violence and abuse. The Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Cross-examination of Parties) Bill 2018 will ensure that appropriate protections are in place for victims of family violence during cross-examination in all family law proceedings.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Family violence is a serious and widespread problem that profoundly affects individuals, families and the communities in which they live. According to a report released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in February, one in six Australian women and one in sixteen Australian men have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a current or previous partner, and one in four women and one in six men have experienced emotional abuse by a current or previous partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is reassuring that direct cross-examination of victims of family violence occurs rarely in the family law courts. Recent research conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that direct crossâ€‘examination in final hearings where there are allegations of family violence and one or both parties are self-represented, occurred in around 173 matters over two years, between 2015 and 2017. Despite the small numbers, the Government is introducing this legislation as a further demonstration of its commitment to protecting families affected by family violence. </span>

The power dynamics underlying family violence can also make it difficult for victims to effectively cross-examine their alleged perpetrator.</span>

This can place victims and children at increased risk of harm. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that the measures in the Bill apply to both parties. That is, where the prohibition applies, a party's legal representative must undertake the cross-examination on their behalf, regardless of whether that party is the perpetrator or the victim.

It is my view that this Bill strikes the right balance between protection and fairness. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current entitlements to Bereavement payments are not changing. This Government recognises that these are important payments for our veterans families during this difficult time. The payment is a one-off non-taxable payment of 98 days (14 weeks) of service pension paid to the surviving partner. It is designed to assist the surviving partner with the costs following the death of their partner and provide a period to adjust their finances following the cessation of their deceased partner's payments. The bereavement payment is paid automatically once the family notifies the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to their death, a veteran may have been receiving an income support pension under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Veterans</span><span style="font-style:italic;">' </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Entitlements</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Act</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">1986</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Generally, there is a small period of time after someone has died before the family notifies DVA and this may result in an overpayment of a pension usually between $500 and $1000. The practice is that where an overpayment occurs, DVA adjusts this amount from the bereavement payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, a veteran dies on the 7 June 2017 and his pension continues to be paid at a rate of $622.80 per fortnight â€“ including a final payment on 22 June (for the period 6-19 Jun). DVA were advised of the death on 30 June 2017. Therefore, the veteran was not entitled to $578.31 (13 days) of the final payment. A bereavement payment is the equivalent to 98 days (14 weeks) of the difference between the service pension rates payable to the surviving partner before and after the death of the deceased partner. Service pension is payable to the partner totalling $2935.80. The amount of $578.31 is recovered from the bereavement payment, making a payment of $2357.49 payable from DVA into the partner's account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This ensures the adjustment is made in a single administrative process rather than through a number of more formal debt recovery process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This avoids the need to recover debts from the deceased estate and avoids disturbing the family during the grieving period. This is a compassionate, sympathetic and unobtrusive response. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will provide legislative certainty for past and future recoveries of pension overpayments from bereavement payments and will maintain the current discreet practice to respect veterans' families mourning their loss. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find myself for the second time this month rising in the Senate to talk about marine protected areas in this country and about the need to take the strongest possible action around the conservation of our species, especially species that are listed as endangered or have conservation dependent listings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only three weeks ago, sadly, this Senate passed this government's marine parks plan that halved green zones on the water protections that were put in place in 2012, by a Labor-Green government, after decades of hard work by thousands of Australians. We saw that shameful outcome. It's really got me in the gut that I've seen this happen in my time as a senator. I was involved in putting together marine protected areas well over a decade ago, before I became a senator, and to see that outcome in my time as a senator was very difficult for me. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I find a situation has arisen where a scalloped hammerhead shark has recently been given a conservation dependent endangered listing in this country. A situation has arisen where laws are being changed by this government to allow a shark, another species that's endangered, to be fished. Not only is it an endangered species, but they want to change the laws to allow it to be fished in a marine protected area. You couldn't make this stuff up, seriously. If you can't protect an endangered species in a marine protected area, what can you do in this country? In a minute I will get to the reasons I think this is happening. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give the Senate a bit of background. I thank the great work of HSI and other environmental groups through their continual chipping away to get this species listed as endangered in this country. It's been listed overseas as endangered for some time, but thanks to our powerful fishing industry and their vested interests that have their way in this place we've only now managed to get it listed in Australia. We know that the population of this globally endangered scalloped hammerhead shark is rapidly declining. It's getting killed on baited drum lines, which we have around this country and which I've campaigned very hard for in my time as a senator to see removed, and this is only one of the many woes that this creature has. It's highly sought after in Asia for shark fin soup and its numbers have declined by up to 80 per cent in North Queensland, since the 1960s, largely due to commercial fishing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let me make this statement and make it very clear: commercial fishing is the major threat facing the endangered scalloped hammerhead shark, and we are debating a disallowance motion to prevent the government actually reducing protections on the hammerhead shark. We are debating my disallowance motion, the Greens disallowance motion, to give the hammerhead shark added protection in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Parkâ€”a marine park that I hope this whole country is behind and proud of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This shark is also caught in recreation and commercial fisheries in gillnets and trawl nets, and as bycatch in the Queensland Shark Control Program. We had high hopes that it would get full endangered listing and therefore wouldn't be available to be caught. However, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee gave it a conservation dependent listing, which means it doesn't receive special protection from commercial fishing, except under active management plans at a state level and except in marine parks, like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, where it does receive special protections because of the way the legislation is set up. But our previous environment minister, Mr Frydenberg, tabled the regulations we have before us today to remove the protection of this endangered scalloped hammerhead shark in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. What is the point of having marine protected areas if the government decides that, for a few commercial interestsâ€”and I understand it's only a few commercial fishing interestsâ€”they will change the law every time it suits their vested interests?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this important? Well, we know our oceans face their greatest threat in history. We know our oceans right around the world have been plundered. We know that we're seeing up to 90 per cent of global fisheries either overfished or fully exploited. We've seen recently in this country scientists release peer reviewed reports in science journals that show the biomass of large pelagic fish in Australia has declined by 30 per cent, even under our fisheries management in the last 10 years. We've seen 1,400 scientists come out in support of the disallowance motion in this Senate, saying, 'Give our marine environment added protections.' We've seen a number of well-respected scientists come out and talk about the hammerhead shark, which we're discussing today, including James Cook University's Professor Colin Simpfendorfer, who I was pleased came to my Senator inquiry into warming oceans when I went to Northern Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a number of scientists who are openly saying that commercial fishing is the key threat to the hammerhead shark and that their populations have declined in Northern Queensland by up to 83 per cent since fishing. We've seen HSI, a group that I've worked with closely around shark nets and baited drum line programs, talk about the documentation we have before us, which, sadly, is very poor, around hammerhead shark catches and scalloped hammerhead shark catches. We know that 14,000 scallop hammerhead sharks have been reported as being killed in the Queensland Shark Control Program because of drum lines or shark nets. These sharks have very small mouths and very small teeth, and, as far as I'm aware, they aren't responsible for any attacks on human beings, yet they continue to be killed by nets and drum lines in places like the Great Barrier Reef. But that's an argument for another time; that's certainly a fight for another time. If the Senate disallows regulation 69 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations 1983 today, then we will see an impact on fishing in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for the scalloped hammerhead shark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to the crossbench to try to get their support for this disallowance motion. I've sought legal advice. I've had the Parliamentary Library do research. I've spoken to scientistsâ€”and Senator Patrick, no doubt, will speak on his issues around this disallowanceâ€”and my understanding is that the hammerhead shark is also very vulnerable to bycatch, especially in gillnets. There are some statistics, although, as I mentioned earlier, the dataset is very poor. The Parliamentary Library, who went to all available sources, said that essentially the dataset is useless to work with. We don't really know. We do know that there's a large number of discards of hammerhead sharks. For every four hammerhead sharks that are caught, only one is kept; the others are discarded. I want to make this very clear to Senator Patrick: those discards are not bycatch; they are deliberate discards by fishermen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to stakeholders about why those sharks would be discarded, and their view is that the market for these sharks has declined significantly over time as the public has become more aware of the fact that these species increasingly are endangered and are listed globally as endangered species, and their consumption has been going down. So you can't say that for every one shark that's kept you're going to get four thrown in the water as bycatch. They are deliberate decisions and, I suspect, they are part of the shark finning market, which we know is highly targeted at the scalloped hammerhead shark. Some new regulations have been brought in by the Queensland government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The implication of letting this disallowance go ahead and making it very difficult for the two commercial fishing operators to continue to catch scalloped hammerhead sharks is that they can't go outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to catch their excess quota, because their catch is limited outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park under these new rules and regulations. There is a potential side effect, and I acknowledge that they may decide to catch other hammerhead sharks in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, rather than the scalloped hammerhead shark. That is a potential side effect, and there may be some bycatch associated with that, but that's exactly what we want: we want less targeted fishing of hammerhead sharks and more targeted fishing of other species. That's actually what we're trying to achieve here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also very unclear how bycatch of scalloped hammerhead sharks could be avoided if other hammerheads are caught. We know that as a fact. But there is no data at all about bycatch of scalloped hammerhead sharks or even other hammerhead sharks. We also know that enforcement and reporting are going to be a very important part of this disallowance if it gets up. It's going to be very important that we have robust reporting and enforcement regimes in place to make sure that we see the conservation of this endangered species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'd like to pose the question that I raised earlier: why is the government introducing these regulations that I'm trying to disallow and that I hope the Senate disallows? Well, there are two commercial fishing interests left operating in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority area, under the authority's jurisdiction, that are using gillnets to target sharks. Environment groups, to their credit, have worked very closely with other fishers and have raised the money to buy out that fishing effort. Of course we would like to see an outcome whereby the existing fishers get bought out. I understand that they're amenable to that. I applaud the environment groups for thinking about the fishers and their communities and going to the extent that they have to get a win-win for both the fishing industry and conservation of these species. I understand that Senator Patrick has had some discussions with government about getting them to do this, and I look forward to hearing shortly about how successful that has been. That would be the ultimate outcome here: conserve a species in a marine protected area and get those fishers bought out, especially if they're amenable to a buyout. Certainly other fishing interests have been, because the environment groups have been able to raise the money to go ahead and do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the government pushing ahead with this? If you believe its technical explanation, it's to get consistency of regulation across areas and to conform with Queensland state government regulations. To get consistency across areasâ€”what does that mean?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole reason we have marine protected areas, the whole reason we set up the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a marine protected areaâ€”the whole reason we went to those lengthsâ€”was to have a different set of rules and regulations for areas of high conservation value. That is why we have a marine park at the Great Barrier Reef, and that is why we have set up marine parks in other parts of this country. Obviously this government has acknowledged the need for those marine parks; however, it's extremely disappointing that, because they're representing a few commercial fishing interests in this place, they've halved those green zones right around this country, which has been a devastating outcome for the conservation movement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that Labor, when they get elected, if they get into governmentâ€”and I've had discussions with them and I've heard them say it publiclyâ€”will upgrade marine protected areas in this country. That's certainly something that I and thousands of other Australians are going to continue to work towards. But, at this time, it is so highly symbolic. The hammerhead shark is an endangered species everywhere around the planet. It has only just got a listing in Australia, and we're contemplating a new set of regulations to actually reduce protections for this endangered species in a marine protected area. You honestly couldn't make this stuff up. That's what this government are doing. That's what this is. There's nothing you can say about the fact that there needs to be consistency of regulations across areas. Seriously, this is what marine parks are set up to do: they're set up to provide conservation outcomes. They're set up to protect species, especially endangered species. </span>

Professor Graham Edgar recently released a report, which has been published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Science</span>â€”and I know it has been disputed by Senator Colbeck and other cronies in the fishing industry because it doesn't fit their mantra about the best managed fisheries in the worldâ€”that clearly says one-third of the biomass of large pelagic fish has been lost in the last ten years under this government's fisheries management. We know the culture in AFMA, from the Borthwick review. It doesn't look at the ecosystem impacts of fisheries. We have worked really hard to try and get this system changed over the years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Professor Edgar, who released this report, has been attacked, by people in the fishing industry and vested interests, for speaking out. He showed very clearly in his study, through observations and modellingâ€”not the pie in the sky stuff that Senator Colbeck representsâ€”through actually physically measuring changes in species, that you can't ignore the loss of our marine species, especially our targeted commercial species, in these areas. His study showed that marine protected areas were the only places where we didn't get big losses in biomassâ€”that they work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourteen hundred scientists, who might disagree with a couple of Senator Colbeck's fishery scientists, came out and made a public statement about the disallowance. Those 1,400 scientists said very clearly: the evidence is in; marine protected areas work. So why make changes to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for one species of endangered shark? Why go to the length of setting that precedent? That's why we have marine parks. That's why we have a process to get sharks like the scalloped hammerhead shark on an endangered species list. It will be a very bad precedent if these regulations get up. This is the fishing industry, the special interests in this place in the ear of the minister, getting what they want. It will not be a good outcome for them, in the end, if this species continues to decline in numbers, as everything suggests it will, and it will not be a good outcome for the Barrier Reef ecosystem. In fact, no-one's going to win if we keep going down this road. Let's make a stand today. Let's stand up for the Great Barrier Reef. Let's stand up for the scalloped hammerhead shark and the powerful example this sets for other marine species that are under pressure. It's hard enough as it is getting something listed in this country, without having to deal with the kind of crap we've got in front of us today.</span>

I've seen the Greens political party in action before. In fact, I remember a Senate committee that Senator Whish-Wilson chaired. After wanting to go for a taxpayer-funded snorkelling trip to the Barrier Reef, he called the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, who, contrary to the allegations of the Greens political party gave evidence every day, inconveniently for the Greens, that actually the waters in the northern Great Barrier Reef were one degree cooler than they had been the previous year.</span>

                    </a>  It's the evidence given to a committee that you chaired, Senator Whish-Wilson. But of course you don't like it because it is an inconvenient truth. Don't worry about the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; we will take the view of a politician, Senator Whish-Wilson.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I once employed, when I was the environment parliamentary secretary, a very able and committed young environmentalist who had previously worked for Greenpeace. I said, in conversation with her once, 'Why did you leave Greenpeace?' She said, 'I could not stand the lies and misrepresentation that these green groups put out.' That was because they worked on the basis that the means justifies the end. They'd just make up any story, any story at all, as long as it would attract a headline on the ABC, which is pretty easy to do. It didn't matter how inaccurate it was. That was the approach of Greenpeace and, from what I've seen through long experience in this chamber, it's the approach of the Greens political party as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Threatened Species Scientific Committee found that the scalloped hammerhead shark could be eligible for the endangered list, but its clear recommendation was for Minister Frydenberg to list the species in the conservation dependent category, as that would provide the best outcome for the survival of this species. That was the recommendation of that scientific committee, but it doesn't accord with Senator Whish-Wilson's jaundiced view on this and other matters. Why did they recommend that? Because strong management actions agreed with the Northern Territory and Queensland governments for the species' protection and recovery could be implemented under law, including within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. That includes limiting the total annual catch of scalloped hammerhead to 200 tonnes or less. The committee said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">â€¦ management actions will remain in place while the species remains listed as Conservation Dependent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also said significantly improved monitoring and reporting would facilitate knowledge of the rates of recovery for the species and underpin the management reforms and future reviews of conservation dependent listing. That's the recommendation of the scientists, but Senator Whish-Wilson and his crazy mates from the Greens political party don't like the scientific evidence, so they make up their own.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have liked to have contributed a full 20 minutes on this, but I'm aware there are a lot of senators who would like to make a contribution. So, unlike Senator Whish-Wilson, I won't take the full 20 minutes. I'll attempt to leave some time for other senators who want to make a contribution. But, before I do allow colleagues to speak, by curtailing my remarks, I just want to read a couple of excerpts from a couple of pieces of correspondence which I've had from constituents of mine in Queensland. One's from David Caracciolo from Mackay Reef Fish Supplies, and I suspect many other senators have got this letter. He says: 'To all senators, I'm writing to make you aware of the false allegations by some green groups who are tryingâ€”and succeedingâ€”to see the demise of all commercial fishing activity in Australian waters.' As a former fisheries minister, I happen to know that that is true. The Greens would like nothing more than to shut down all forestry and to shut down all fishing within Australian waters.</span>

                    </a>  Yes, they still eat fish! So we could use imported fish from sources that are sometimes questionableâ€”that's what the Greens want. But fortunately the majority in this place don't agree with them. This letter from Mr Caracciolo, who is a well-regarded, well-respected person in the Mackay area, says: 'The latest allegations are that the scalloped hammerhead shark is near extinction in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. These allegations are totally incorrect. The commercial sector does not target this species, so the managers will not see big catches reported in logs, but we do catch some when we are targeting other species that are incidental catches.' He goes on with some very compelling arguments which I don't have time to read in full, but I will come to the paragraph that is important to me as a representative of Queensland constituents. He says: 'There are lots of associated businesses along these coastal towns of Queensland that rely on these producers for supply of fresh seafood to sell to consumers who cannot catch their own fish and our tourists who come to these regions. I do hope this does not fall on deaf ears and you can see how wrong these motions are. There are a lot of livelihoods that you guys are holding in your decisions.' That's a sentiment that I think is mirrored by most people, not just those in the fishing industry, along the coast of Queensland who I represent.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other letter I just want to very briefly mention is from Margaret Stevenson from Burnett Heads near Bundaberg in Queensland. She's the wife of a commercial fisherman. She's been involved in fisheries issues for 20 years. She was on the Queensland shark working group and is currently on the Queensland government's East Coast Inshore Fishery Working Group. She says: 'Whilst the hammerhead shark is supposed to be under threat in some parts of the world, when I was on the shark working committee we were told that the entire Australian take of these sharks is approximately one per cent of the world's take.' So clearlyâ€”and I say this with ironyâ€”this is a fish that is under threat! She goes on to say: 'They are extremely common in Queensland waters. In recent years our Queensland government has taken steps to control and reduce the commercial take to ensure that it does not increase in order to prevent our Queensland catch, less than one per cent of the world's take, impacting on world stocks.' Mrs Stevenson goes on to mention the importance of the fishing industry to a lot of communities along the Queensland coast and to the consumers of seafood who like to eat Australian seafood, rather than imported seafood. The science is with the way this government has dealt with matters. Clearly, there is no danger to the species whatsoever. It's properly managed. And this disallowance motion should be defeated.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  Tonight this disallowance motion is one that Labor supports. It is against the proposed amendments to change the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations to allow fishing for the scalloped hammerhead. We know that these are internationally recognised as endangered and under threat from fishing activity. We know that this issue before us today, in terms of the disallowance, should be supported because this government hasn't taken the time to find a solution that works for the fishing industry or, frankly, for the protection of a World Heritage area and this protected species.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the marine park act applies stricter conditions to the fishing for species listed in any category of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the list of threatened fauna, than applies in other areas managed by Australian governments. This is important to note because we expect a high standard of protection within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Parkâ€”this act predates the EPBC Actâ€”and because of the reef's conservation value and subsequent World Heritage protections. This is important to note because, again, it goes to the onus on us in the parliament to make sure that the reef and the species within it have the necessary protection they need. So we know that under this act targeted fishing for any species listed under any category in the EPBC Act of threatened fauna is simply not allowed. This is different to the EPBC Act itself, which allows for conservation dependent species to be fished within the provision of a management plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in 2018 the Threatened Species Scientific Committee confirmed that scalloped hammerheads met the criteria for listing as endangered, but advised the Minister for the Environment to list them as conservation dependent under the EPBC Act, which allows fishing to continue in some waters. We know that the scientific committee required certain improvements to management of the species in order to support the listing category from jurisdictions around the country. They did not recommend amending the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park regulations to allow for targeted fishing of scalloped hammerhead sharks to continue in the marine park. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee did not recommend that. What they did recommend was a revision of the total allowable commercial catch limits for hammerheads, and that these limits should include discarded shark and catch by the Queensland Shark Control Program. They also recommended the landing of hammerhead sharks with fins naturally attached. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee considered this a critical element within management arrangements to maintain a conservation dependent listing. The absence of this policy, they said, could lead to a review of the listing category and a possible up-listing of this species to endangered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have before us tonight in this disallowance a recognition that the federal government has failed in its responsibility to address fishery issues outlined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Great</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Barrier</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Reef</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">outlook</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">report</span> of 2014, where the targeting of top predators such as sharks is identified as a critical risk to the health of the reef. The Minister for the Environment has tabled amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations that would allow for the fishing of the scalloped hammerhead species within the marine park, despite its conservation dependent listing. So the motion before us tonight, which Labor supports, is against the proposed amendments to change the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act regulations to allow for the fishing of the scalloped hammerhead. They are, in fact, internationally recognised as endangered and under threat from fishing activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the protestations from those opposite, we have received advice that says the numbers of scalloped hammerheads have declined by between 63 per cent and 80 per cent within the reef. They are more at risk of extinction than lions, cheetahs, polar bears and giant pandas. We support this disallowance motion because the government has not taken the time to find a solution that works for the fishing industry or for the adequate protection of a World Heritage area. This government simply wants to change the rules in our most precious of placesâ€”the Great Barrier Reef. They, tonight, want to weaken environmental protections. I stress: this is a World Heritage area of great value to Australia and also to the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extractive industries are and should be subject to the very strictest of rules in World Heritage areas, and the Great Barrier Reef should be treated no differently. We know that the reef is under enormous pressure from this government, and this is all happening at a time when it wants to weaken regulations to allow an endangered species to be killedâ€”not accidentally caught by a fisher and reported as something to be concerned about but sold on the market if caught. We understand on this side that sustainable fishing jobs are important. We want jobs in the reef to remain, but we will not compromise on standards that have been in place since the marine park was first established. Shark sightings of this very species are highly valuable to the tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef. Did you know that shark diving, shark tourism, is worth some $25.5 million annually to Australia's regional economy, and that this kind of tourism is growing? We accept that standards in the reef, a World Heritage area, should be and are higher than other protected areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government tonight is trying to present a case that the sharks caught will simply be wasted, because they can't be sold and industry will lose an income stream. Let's be clear: if a fishery relies on catching threatened species to make money, it's just delaying the inevitable. If they rely on funds from selling that threatened species, eventually there will be none left to catch. This revenue stream is simply on an inevitable decline. We have to stop it so that we can protect the species, or the revenue stream will end because the species is simply no longer there; it will be extinct. So the government's logic simply does not add up. It has presented a case but it has not tried to find a solution that protects the World Heritage values of the reef and marine park. There are options, and the government should be pursuing them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government presented Labor with a plan to transition the industry, we would be happy to discuss it. If it made an effort to protect a species in a World Heritage area and brought the industry into discussion, we would also be up for that. Reform of the fishery in which scalloped hammerhead sharks are caught is certainly an option, as it's a high-risk fishery operating in a World Heritage area. The Queensland government, which manages the fishery in which scalloped hammerheads are caught, has said that they're committed to overall reform of the Queensland fisheries, as outlined in their sustainable fisheries strategy. The fishery in which these hammerheads are caught is a priority fishery for review by the Queensland government. So we have here a Queensland government that's taking positive steps. We'd like to see the Commonwealth Morrison government do more to help. What could you do? What kinds of time frames on regulations could be a solution?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have options available to you. But, no; instead, what you do is sell out our environment. Whenever there's an opportunity to protect the environment, you choose its destruction. Whenever there's an opportunity to protect a species and do some work to find an answer, you take the easy option and you're completely missing in action.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  Centre Alliance will not be supporting this disallowance motion, and it does so on the basis that the likely outcome of disallowing the legislation is that we'll see more hammerhead sharks being killed than if the regulation were to stand. The threatened species scientific community has determined that hammerhead sharks should be protected. The hammerhead shark is now conservation dependent. Queensland fishery management has been adjusted accordingly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question is: if we let the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park be a sanctuary for hammerheads, would it stop the catching of hammerheads; would it reduce the number of hammerheads caught? I spoke to all sides of the argument. I spoke to Humane Society International. I spoke to AFMA. I spoke to scientists. I spoke to fisheries. I spoke to Senator Whish-Wilson on a couple of occasions. The first point to appreciate is that these sharks are migratory. A sanctuary doesn't actually assist them. The second point to appreciate is that the catching of the hammerhead is largely incidental to other fishing. Certainly, in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, that's the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When sharks are caught in gillnets that are designed to catch other fish, they often die before they make it on board the fishing vessel or shortly thereafter, and they're returned overboard. That happens because of stress to the animal. Four out of five sharks die irrespective of whether they're thrown back. So you can ban the fishing of hammerheads in marine parks, but they'll still be caught in gillnets and will still die. But, in that instance, what will happen is they won't be taken back to shore and counted. More sharks could legally be caught outside the marine park. In fact, they could be targeted in other areas of Queensland outside the marine park. With the regulations in place, those sharks are retained on board, counted in the Queensland quota and are returned to shore where the scientific data that everyone agrees is lacking is then collected. If the regulation is disallowed, the sharks will still be caught, four in five sharks will die, but they won't be included in the Queensland quota and they won't be taken back to shore to allow scientific data to be collected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we accept, as Labor has put, that there are many things that could be done for the betterment of the species, but unfortunately that's not on offer here. So, just focusing on the regulation that is before the Senate, it's our considered view, after talking to all sides of the argument, that the disallowance in this circumstance would result in a worse outcome for sharks, and therefore we can't support it.</span>

I say to Labor: the Queensland Labor government actually supported this process. So to suggest that Labor's actions here in Canberra are supported by the Queensland Labor government is not true. They actually supported this process because, rather than this affecting just a couple of net fishers, as Senator Whish-Wilson indicated, this would affect hundreds of net fishers all up and down the Queensland coast.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not be shy about this. Senator Whish-Wilson's motion is just about stopping fishing. That's all it's about. He's not interested in good fisheries management. He misrepresents terribly. He is not interested in good fisheries management. He quotes a piece of alleged scienceâ€”I think is probably better to sayâ€”which is based on people going snorkelling in inshore waters and trying to correlate that to the impacts on our Commonwealth waters outside three kilometres. This is not science. This observational science that he talks of, that he quotes in support of his argument, is not science.</span>

                    </a>  It's not science. And he also quotes, in an attempt to frighten the Australian people about global fish stocks, a number of 90 per cent of global fisheries that are overfished or fully exploited. That is actually the number, but what he fails to say is that 'fully exploited' means 'sustainably fished'â€”so, a complete and utter misrepresentation; a lie, in factâ€”</span>

                    </a>  No; in global fisheries management language. Senator Whish-Wilson simply cannot be trusted with the truth in this argument. All he wants to do, with Mr Tony Burkeâ€”I was going to say 'from the Greens', and he might as well beâ€”from the Labor Party, is shut down fisheries management. That's what he wants to do. He neglects to say that the reason for the listing of scalloped hammerhead sharks as a conservation dependent species under Australia's EPBC Act follows a listing on appendix 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES. The listing was due to poor fisheries management and the result of heavy overfishing in the Atlantic Ocean. That was the reason for the listing on CITES. Senator Whish-Wilson makes no comment about that in his remarks. He wants to give the impression that there's an issue here. This process will actually manage it. This will manage the fishery sustainably, and disallowance of this regulation will do nothing to protect or recover the species in the Atlantic or other populations.</span>

We are very proud to have put in place the best marine parks and one of the largest marine parks regimes in the world. The government, obviously, won't be supporting this disallowance motion. I urge other colleagues in the chamber not to support this disallowance motion, because it won't do anything to improve the stocks of hammerhead sharks.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â€”<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals and Minister for Regional Services, Sport, Local Government and Decentralisation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  As I was saying, the proposed list is narrower, identifies appropriate law enforcement officers and is consistent with the list of authorised persons in the Family Law Rules and the Federal Circuit Court rules. It is appropriate that the list of persons who can be authorised as arresters under the Family Law Act continues to include Australian Border Force officers, who will provide support to combat instances of international child abduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like other law enforcement officers, Australian Border Force officers are expected to and do undertake structured and specialised training in arrest powers. The Australian Border Force College provides training that includes face-to-face learning with legal officers on the parameters surrounding the use of power, discussions with experienced Australian Border Force officers who have used these powers and practical scenarios to assess an officers' understanding of the use of power in the operational context. Only Australian Border Force officers who have received training in relation to arrest, entry and search powers and their limitations would exercise those powers in operating environments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill would also make minor and technical amendments to the Family Law Act to clarify definitions and remove redundant provisions. Amendments to the International Arbitration Act 1974 would specify the meaning of 'competent court' for the purpose of the Model Law, clarify procedural requirements for enforcement of an arbitral award, modernise provisions governing arbitrators' powers to award costs in international commercial arbitrations and clarify the application of confidentiality provisions to arbitration subject to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules on Transparency and Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration. Amendments to the Marriage Act 1961 would remove outdated concepts and ensure consistency with the Family Law Act in relation to parental consent for marriage of minors. Technical amendments of minor policy significance would also be made to improve the operation of the Commonwealth Marriage Celebrants Program. The Registrar of Overseas Marriages would also be reinstated, remedying a defect in existing legislation. An amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 would repeal section 43 of that act to remove the ability for women to be discriminated against in connection with employment, engagement or appointment in Australian Defence Force positions involving combat duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government welcomes the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee recommending that the bill pass with some amendments. The government also welcomes the consideration of the bill by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The government has circulated amendments that respond to the issues raised by these committees.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill will make minor and technical amendments to improve the efficiency and operation of the civil justice system and provide individuals with greater access to justice.</span>

In the long period since its introduction we in Labor have negotiated a number of amendments with the government to improve a number of measures in this bill and to clear up a number of minor inconsistencies and issues with drafting. Labor supports the amendments on sheet GJ134, all of which will improve the operation of the various acts that will be amended by this bill.</span>

This would provide an exemption from discrimination law not only for marriage celebrants but also for wedding planners, reception venue operators, florists and cake suppliers. It would assist those who wish to service same-sex marriages only and it would assist those who wish to service heterosexual marriages only.</span>

But, in addition, the Liberal Democrats have always argued that the government has no business telling people they must facilitate a same-sex marriage or, indeed, that they must facilitate a heterosexual marriage. Seeking freedom for one group at the price of denying it to another is not liberty, it is hypocrisy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, can I point out: this is an issue of considerable significance to the Liberal Party and the conservative elements within the Labor Party. It is, indeed, a key issue to what's known as the 'Liberal base'. These are the concerns of that Liberal base which arose in the context of the same-sex marriage debate which were considered by the Ruddock inquiry, which the government is still to do anything with.</span>

There is no possibility that the government can say, 'Well, it hasn't gone to our party room.' The question, of course, is, 'Why didn't it go to the party room, if that's where it needed to go?' I'm pretty confident that, if it had gone to the party room, the party room would have said: 'Hell yes! Let's support this. This solves one of our main concerns.' The question then is: if not now, for this kind of amendment for the government to support, then when? If not now, then when? I intend to call a division on this. I commend my amendment to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposing this part of the Civil Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, we aim to preserve the exemption of the Australian Defence Force from the Sexual Discrimination Act 1984. For good reason, this exemption has been in place since the act first passed into law in 1984. Currently, this bill seeks to repeal section 43 of the Sexual Discrimination Act, which would make discrimination against women in connection with employment in, engagement to or appointment to an Australian Defence Force position involving combat duties unlawful. Adopting Greens' policy, the Turnbull-Morrison government decided to remove the gender restrictions from ADF combat roles from 1 January 2016, regardless of the adverse impact of this on military capability. This bill seeks to bind future governments to the same policy and to compel military commanders to disregard gender as a criterion for selection of soldiers for physically demanding combat roles. Such a move can only compromise the capability of our military forces and our collective will as a nation to defend ourselves.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator ANNING:</span>
                    </a>  I question whether mums and dads at home are ready for the stream of body bags filled with the mutilated remains of young girls cut down in the flower of their youth. How willing will this country be to confront hostile nations that threaten our nation and our way of life when this is the price? Or will the increased cost of war, made infinitely more terrible through the sacrifice of those who might have been the wives and mothers of the future, paralyse our national will and cause us to appease tyrants and military aggressors, to our enduring cost?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the limitation of female service in the military has been in practice since time immemorial because of simple biology. The simple fact is that there are many jobs associated with combat that many women lack the physical attributes to undertake. No reasonable person would seek to deny women the right to do any job for which they are physically capable. But the inconvenient truth is that there are some jobs, including many involved in military combat roles, for which many women are physically unsuited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this undeniable fact of biology does not conform to the socialist fantasy that anyone can do anything, that biology means nothing and that only environment shapes us. A favourite left-wing fantasy is the nonsense that men and women are somehow equally physically capable. Despite the biological differences between men and women that, regardless of environment, give rise to huge differences in upper body strength, physical endurance and aggression, the Left likes to pretend that biology makes no difference. Those of us who have served in the military are well aware of the significant deficiencies in the field performance of some women. Genetic factors define us and are the basis of both our strengths and our weaknesses. As a result of this, women are much better at many things than men, and men are better at some things than women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a broader social context, physical capability is an issue that has been taken seriously by a number of peak sporting bodies. Recently, footballer Hannah Mouncey was subjected to a litany of requests and requirements, including blood tests, to ensure that her physical capability did not overmatch that of the other competitors. Fallon Fox, an MMA fighter, beat to a bloody pulp a number of female opponents, entering the ring as a transgender fighter. There were howls of outrage due to the physical capabilities of both participants in their respective sports. Yet we are ignoring the same issue, not in a sporting context but in the defence of our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a matter of prejudice or environment; it is simply a function of biology. However, because the truth conflicts with the leftist ideological dogma, this irrefutable fact of nature is disregarded. Of course, I have no objection to people of equal ability being given equal opportunity in roles where their lack of strength, physical endurance and aggression makes no difference. I am all for women being treated equally in the military. However, combat service, particularly in the Army and the Navy, where strength really matters, is one area where the left-wing ideological dogma of physical equality of the sexes faces the harsh reality of truth. The left-wing Liberals in the Morrison government can joins hands with left-wing Labor and the Greens in pretending that the world is other than it is. But the truth really cannot be evaded, and trying to do so brings a significant cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Public Service, grim socialist determination to ensure equal responsibility of both genders simply sacrifices merit upon the altar of gender equality. This is unjust, but there is no significant detriment to the nation as a whole. However, in the military an effort to ensure that women achieve equal outcomes in areas where there is an explicit physical inequality of ability directly threatens operational capability. As a result of gender blindness, women are to be deliberately placed in roles that they may or may not be able to do. This is not only unfair to the better-qualified members who miss out as a result but is actually a threat to our nation's ability to defend itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let us be clear what this section of the bill is about, because the Liberal-Nationals government, like Labor and the Greens, wants to pretend that everyone can do every job. If this bill passes without amendment, military commanders will be forced to employ women in jobs that they may not be able to do. I ask senators to support my amendment to keep in place the ADF exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and in so doing ensure that Australia's ability to defend itself will not be sacrificed in favour of political correctness.</span>

The Australian government are deeply committed to gender equality and opposed to gender based discrimination. This is why we've proposed an amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to remove the ability for women to be discriminated against in connection with the ADF combat roles. The amendments would not have any impact on current ADF practice or policy. As of 1 January 2016, all gender restrictions have been removed from the ADF combat roles. This means that all women have an equal opportunity to apply and be considered for all ADF positions. This minor legislative amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act will remove the combat duties exemption to ensure Australian law aligns with the government's policy position and the current ADF position. Consistent with these changes to domestic law and policy, the Australian government is also moving to withdraw its reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women relating to the exclusion of women from combat duties.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 1) Bill 2018. I will discuss later the proposed amendment we will put forward. That amendment, however, does not alter the operation of the measures in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill reflects last year's budget announcement that the government would commit to two of the interim Black Economy Taskforce report's recommendations. Schedule 1 of this bill prohibits the production, distribution and possession of sales suppression tools in relation to a business's tax obligations, and prohibits the use of electronic sales suppression tools to keep tax records incorrectly. Transaction data recorded by modern points-of-sale systems are a key component of a business's sales and accounting systems, and are particularly important for tax audit purposes. However, this has led to the development of electronic sales suppression tools that facilitate tax evasion by suppressing or falsifying records of transactions resulting from these systems. Such concerns had been flagged in prebudget submissions, including by Chartered Accountants Australia &amp; New Zealand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, the taxation law contains a variety of offences, as well as civil administrative penalties relating to record keeping and tax evasion. Although these offences may apply to entities that use electronic sales suppression software to keep records incorrectly, the government argues that the current maximum penalties for the offences are not high enough to reflect the seriousness of using a tool to misrepresent an entity's tax position. The manufacture of electronic sales suppression tools may already be captured by the Criminal Code. However, as the bill's explanatory memorandum notes, these provisions require an intention that the device will be used to commit an offence of forgery or only apply to Commonwealth documents. These requirements can be difficult to satisfy in the case of electronic sales suppression tools.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As such, the offences in the bill are strict liability offences, as are the administrative penalties. It will not be necessary to establish fault if a person has produced or supplied an electronic sales suppression tool or provided a service in relation to such a tool. Similarly, the offences do not require any knowledge about the intended or actual use of an electronic sales suppression tool. Entities and persons that would otherwise commit an offence, or are subject to administrative penalties in relation to the production, distribution or possession of an electronic sales suppression tool are entitled to a defence from the relevant offence if the purpose of their conduct is to prevent or deter tax evasion or enforce an existing law. Anyone relying on this defence bears the evidential burden in proving the purpose for which they undertook the relevant conduct. The measure is similar to laws introduced into comparable jurisdictions like Canada.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill requires entities providing courier or cleaning services that have an ABN to report information to the ATO about transactions that involve engaging other entities to undertake those courier or cleaning services for them. This is an extension of the existing taxable payments reporting system that currently covers the building and construction industry and other sectors at high risk of tax avoidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The former Labor government introduced the TPRS, which was introduced in the 2012-13 financial year. Labor is pleased to see the government embrace Labor's important tax integrity measures. When the TPRS began it required businesses in the building and construction industry to report payments they make to contractors for building and construction services to the ATO. Evidence suggests that this program has improved contractor tax complianceâ€”</span>
